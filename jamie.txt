[siren wailing]
[somber music playing]
[Harvey Levin] Jamie Foxx suffered a very serious medical emergency.
Bad enough that family members flew in.
Actor Jamie Foxx is asking for prayers as the actor has now spent more than two weeks in an Atlanta hospital. Foxx literally died and had to be revived. That’s what the health emergency was.
Somebody in the clone department gettin’ lazy, bro.
It’s not Jamie Foxx.
My gut feeling is telling me that Jamie Foxx is dead.
[distorted] Dead. Dead. Dead.
[somber music fades out]

Give it up for my daughter, man. Give it up. [blow horn sounds] This shit feel good as fuck, man. I don’t know if…
[crowd cheers]
I’m still sexy, though. You see that sexy shit. Still sexy, motherfucker. You say, “I love you” still. You have no idea, Atlanta. Y’all saved my life. Just 400 yards away from here, at Piedmont Hospital, they put me back together again. God be the glory.
[crowd] Yeah!
God is good.
[crowd] Yeah!
And all the time!
[crowd] God is good! Man, I ain’t gonna make it through this shit.
[crowd cheers]
Atlanta saved my life.
[crowd cheers]
Atlanta saved my life. The internet tried to kill me, though.
[crowd jeers]
[Jamie] They said I was paralyzed.
[man] That’s right.
Said I couldn’t walk. But look at me now.

Okay, okay, okay, okay. That’s good. That’s enough. That’s too close.
Stop, stop, stop.
[music stops] That’s too close. Y’all good?
[woman laughs]
[crowd cheers] [sighs] Atlanta saved my life. [audience cheers] The internet was trying to kill me, though. [crowd murmurs] The internet said that Puffy tried to kill me.
[crowd jeers]
That’s what the internet was saying. I know what you’re thinking, “Did-he?” [all laughing] Hell naw, n*gga. I left them parties early. I was out by nine, n*gga. “Somethin’ don’t look right, n*gga.” “It’s slippery in here, n*gga.”
[crowd gasps and laughs]
Atlanta saved my life.
[crowd cheers]
The internet tried to kill me.
Katt Williams!
[audience jeers]
Katt Williams got in on it. Did y’all see the special? Katt Williams said he knew. [imitating Katt] “Jamie Foxx got so much money.” “They say he’s sufferin’ from a mystery illness.” “A mystery illness?” “What the ♪ Fuck?” ♪
That shit sound just like that, n*gga.
[crowd cheers]
That n*gga said… “Goddamn, that sound… [imitating Katt, dramatically] …a mystery illness.” “What the fuck?” [scoffs] That n*gga turned into the Wicked Witch of the West. [imitates Wicked Witch] “A mystery illness.” “I’ll get you my little Jamie and your little dog Toto too.” [cackles]
[crowd laughs]
Katt will say 2,000 things that don’t make sense, right? But then say four things that make sense and put “sir” after it. “The glass is half full, sir. I just filled it to the top, sir.” [crowd laughs] “Man goes to bed with an itchy ass, he wakes up with a smelly finger, sir.” [audience chuckles] [Jamie] I know, man. Y’all know me, man. And I’m so glad to see y’all here. I’m so glad to be here. [audience cheers] This is what I needed, man. You got a lot of people that prayed to make sure I was here.
[audience] Yes.
Yes. And I appreciate every prayer, man. Now, what’s interesting is Katt Williams might be onto something. Because it is a mystery. [clicks tongue] We still don’t know exactly what happened to me. [sighs] All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer. Because I needed… every prayer. I appreciate every well-wish, Atlanta. Uh… to the world, I… I can’t thank you enough, even when I see people on the street, and they roll their window down and yell out, “Man, we glad you here.” As I look out, and I see my family and I… see my friends. [clicks tongue] I can’t tell you how good it feels. If you could see it through here… it feels amazing.
[crowd cheers]
It actually happened here in Atlanta. A little history, Atlanta, I started doing stand-up comedy back in 1991, right here in Atlanta. So it’s fitting that I came back here to tell you, uh, the story because… what had happened was… [clicks tongue] [sighs, exhales deeply]
[sniffles]
[woman 1] We love you.
[woman 2] Atlanta saved your life.
Hey, hello. You did. [crying] Wow. Man, please, Lord. Let me get through this. [crowd cheers]
Please.
[woman 3] All right, you got it! You got it! [cheering continues] April 11th, I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for a aspirin, and I realized quickly that when you in a medical emergency, your boys don’t know what the fuck to do. And I was like, “Damn.” But I was having such a bad headache. So, I asked my boy, I said, “Listen, I need a… a… a aspirin.” Before I could get the aspirin… [ominous tones play] [clicks tongue] …I went out. [sniffles] [music fades] I don’t, um… I don’t remember 20 days.
[woman 1] Oh, man.
[audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What they told me was, was that… [clicks tongue]…they took me to the first doctor. And that doctor just gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home. [crowd murmurs] Yeah, I don’t know… What the fuck is that? [crowd chuckles] I don’t know if you can do Yelps… [audience chuckles] …for doctors, man. That’s half a star, n*gga. [audience laughs] You know? “No, he good. Give him that.” Man, what the fuck? But my sister… said, “No.” [woman] All right. Four foot 11… of nothin’ but pure love said that something’s wrong with my brother. She came over to see me, and I was… They told me I was leth… lethargic. And she says, “Get him in the car. That ain’t my brother right there.” My little sister who’s always played the background, now gotta play the lead. [man] Amen. [inhales sharply] They say she drove around Atlanta, sorta aimlessly. She didn’t really know where the hospitals was. But as she was drivin’ around, she came up on Piedmont Hospital. Give it up for Piedmont. [crowd cheering] What’s interesting about it is that as she drove around, she didn’t know anything about Piedmont Hospital, but she had a hunch that some angels is in there.
[woman 1] Mm-hmm.
[crowd murmurs in agreement] ‘Cause she said, “That’s what we gon’ need.”
[scattered applause]
[man 1] All right. [woman 2 whoops]
[man 2] Yes!
[woman 3] Hallelujah!
[woman 4] Love you.
Love you.
[woman 5] Atlanta saved your life!
Atlanta saved my life. [crowd cheering] So they tell me my sister took me into the hospital. And this cool white boy, Dr. Schuette… Cool white boy. They say he had on a Laker jersey. Just cool as shit, you know? But… he told my sister some horrible news about… her big brother. He said… “He’s havin’ a brain bleed…
[audience murmurs]
[Jamie sighs] …that’s led to a stroke.” [clicks tongue] Damn. [emotionally] Me. Me, man. Me. [softly] Wow. Here’s the thing. When you dream about what you want to be in life, you don’t dream tragedy.
[crowd] No.
You dream everything is good. “I… I got the life. I got the cars.” “I got all that.” [sniffles] You don’t dream that something would go wrong. But when something does go wrong… you need a sister.



Four foot 11.
[crowd] Mm-hmm.
Full of nothin’ but love.
[audience cheers and applauds] [sighs, sniffles] The cool doctor with the Laker jersey, white dude, said, “Listen.” “He’s havin’ this brain bleed that led to a stroke, and if I don’t go in his head right now, we’re gonna lose him.” [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What I was told was my sister fired right back and said, “You can go in his head, but you ain’t gonna find nothin’.” [audience laughs] He said, “Why you say that?” She said, “Have you seen how big this n*gga’s head is?” [audience laughs] My sister made a joke because sometimes you gotta laugh…
[crowd] To keep from crying.
…to keep from cryin’.
[crowd murmurs in agreement, applauds]
[cheering]
What actually happened was the doctor said, “If I don’t go in his head, we’re gonna lose him, and she fired back and said, “You can go in his head, but you’re not gonna find anything ’cause I already talked to God.”
[woman 1] That’s right.
[crowd cheers] The cool white doctor, named Dr. Schuette, shot right back and said, “I’m a religious man too.”
[woman 2 whoops]
[woman 3] All right. But I gotta do my job. [woman 3] All right. So, what I was told is that they take me in to operate on me, and, uh, my sister knelt down outside the operating room and prayed the whole time. [woman 3] All right. [quietly] Your life doesn’t flash before your face. It was kinda… oddly peaceful. I say this all the time. I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. I didn’t see the light. [audience chuckles] I was in a tunnel, though. It was hot in that tunnel.
[woman 1] Ooh!
[audience murmurs and chuckles] [laughing] [audience murmurs] Shit, am I goin’ to the wrong place in this motherfucka? ‘Cause I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the devil.
Like, “Come on, n*gga.”
[audience chuckles] Or was that Puffy?
[audience gasps and laughs]
[Jamie] I’m fuckin’ around. But if it was Puffy, he had a flamin’ bottle of Johnson &… No, I’m just kiddin’. [imitating Puffy] “Come on in!” No, I’m just kidding. [laughter dies down] No, I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. [clicks tongue] But my sister… [sniffles] …prayed the whole time. And when that cool white dude… [sniffles] …Dr. Schuette came out, he said, “Well, um, you was right.” “Your prayers are answered. We didn’t find where it was comin’ from.” “But he is havin’ a stroke.” “He may be able to make a full recovery.” “But it’s gonna be the worst year of his life.” [sniffles] That’s what it was, Atlanta. You finally got the story.
[man] Amen.
[clicks tongue]
[woman] Saved your life!
Saved my life. [crowd cheers] That’s why this moment is the most incredible moment. ‘Cause you do take it for granted. [sniffles] But I’mma tell you something about my sister, Deidra Dixon, and my daughter Corinne Marie Foxx. [dramatically] They held me the fuck down! [audience cheers] “Nobody sees him!” They cut it all off. [crowd cheers] They held it down. They didn’t want you to see me like that. I didn’t want you to see me like that.
I want you to see me like this.
[crowd] Yeah! [audience cheers] There’s another reason too why my daughter didn’t want nobody to see me ’cause I was dizzy from the… the stroke. I was so dizzy. So, my head would do this.
[crowd laughs]
Stop… Stop laughing. Laugh. Go ahead, n*gga. I understand. But she says, “They gon’ meme the fuck outta this motherfucker.” [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I was doing that. [laughs] But now I have a better appreciation when I see people out and they doing this. I be like, “Oh, I know what that is. What’s up?” [crowd laughs] “What’s up with you?” “What’s up? Just chillin’.” “Just hangin’ out. What’s new?” I know. It’s fucked up, right? [audience chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles die down]
[woman] You look good!
[Jamie] Thank you so much. I feel good.
[audience cheers]
Twenty days I don’t remember. [sniffles]
But on May 4th…
[crowd] Yeah? I woke up. [snaps] [crowd cheers] And when I woke up, I found myself in a wheelchair.
I couldn’t walk.
[audience groans] Couldn’t walk, bro. In a wheelchair, and I was like, “What the fuck is…?” “Why am I in a wheelchair?” I’m just coming out of some shit. I looked at Dave Brown. I said, “What am I doin’ in a wheelchair?” He said, “Foxx, you don’t remember?” “No! Why?” “What y’all doin’?” He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” [clicks tongue] “Dave, knock it off. Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.”
[audience chuckles]
He said, “You don’t remember?” “I don’t remember, but I know Jamie Foxx ain’t got no stroke.” “‘Cause I’m Jamie Foxx. Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx.”
[audience laughs]
He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” “And don’t try to get out of that chair, ’cause you can’t walk.” I said, “N*gga…” [hesitates] “Shit!” [audience laughs] “What the fuck you do to my legs, Dave?” I said, “Dave…” [splutters] “What’s going on, man?” He said, “Foxx, it’s real.” “Come on, Dave, man. That’s a horrible joke.” [man 1] You right! I said, “Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [sighs] [crying] “It’s a bad joke, Dave.” [sniffles] “I don’t get strokes. Come on, man.” [audience murmurs sympathetically]
[man 2] We love you, man.
I love you back. [audience cheers] [quietly] “I don’t get strokes. I don’t get strokes.” “That’s old man shit, man. I don’t get no strokes, n*gga.” Stop this fucking… prank. [sniffles] [clicks tongue, sniffles] They flew me to Chicago for my rehab. Chi-town. [audience cheers] Right there. They took care of me. Shirley Ryan, right over there. [audience cheering] Took care of me. [clicks tongue] But when I got to the rehab, there was this lady that was all over me. She was all over me, brushin’ my teeth, and… and… and… and washing my face, fixin’ my clothes, pushin’ my wheelchair.
And I’m like, “Damn…” [mumbles]
[audience laughs] “Who is this bitch all over me, man?” “She all over me, n*gga. She all over me, n*gga.” I said, “Dave, is she a fan? Did she see Django? Like, what? Shit.” “Why she all over me like this, dawg?” And Dave says something that stopped me in my tracks. He says, “Foxx, that’s your nurse.” I said, “What kind of old man shit is that?” So, the first night, she says, “Okay. Time for the showers.” I say, “Okay. Somebody put me in the chair, get me to the water, I’ll knock it out.” She says, “No, I’m gonna bathe you.” I said, “No, the fuck you ain’t.” She says, “Well… “I say, “No, no, no.” “You not finna… No. You not finna see this pickle.” [audience laughs] She said, “What you mean?” I say, “Uh-uh. It’s…” “Why?” I said, “No. ‘Cause there’s shit goes along with this pickle.”
“I’m Black.”
[audience laughs] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “It’s a whole lot of shit goin’ on here with this pickle.” “I just can’t let you see this pickle just on… out the package that quick.” [audience laughs] I said, “There’s something wrong with it. I don’t know if it’s been cold.” Fellas, you know how it is. You don’t ever take your pants off right away in front of your girl. You gotta… pump some oil in that motherfucker. Your girl… Ever pull your drawers up? “Bitch. Hold on!” [crowd laughs] “What’s wrong?” “Ain’t nothin’ in this motherfucker yet.” And that shit be stuck to your thighs. She’s like, “Are you okay?” “No! You got to give me a three count.” [audience laughs] “Give me a three count before you expose my pickle like that.” I gotta… You know… That bitch… Even if we ain’t finna fuck, it gotta have a certain… [inhales sharply] So, I’m sayin’ this to the lady. I said, “You can’t see my pickle,” and she hit me with some crazy shit. She said, “J, you don’t remember, do you?” “What?” “I’ve been bathing you for the past month and a half.”
[audience exclaims, laughs]
[imitating Katt Williams] I said, “Mystery illness?” [audience laughs] “What the fuck?” She been bathing me for a month and a half. I said, “You been in there?” She says, “All in there.” Goddamn! – “All in there?”
[emphatically] “Yes, all in there.” [inhales sharply] Fuck! That affected me more than the stroke.
I’m like, “Damn, is my dick dead?”
[crowd laughs] “Because I need my dick!” [audience laughs] But, yeah. She said she’d been all in there, and then I asked a silly question. I said, “Well, was I representin’?” [audience laughs] She says, “I don’t know what that means.” She don’t, but we know what that means, right, brother? I’m like, “Fuck!” [inhales sharply] “Shit!” “She’s seen it!” “And I don’t remember her seein’ it!” So it hit me. I ain’t seen my dick in 20 days. So I rush to the bathroom, pull my pants down, look down. That motherfucker had a stroke too. [audience laughs] I said, “Man, what’s wrong, n*gga?” “You tell me, n*gga, what’s wrong?” “What happened?” “I don’t know. The lights went off.” [audience laughs] “You cool?” “No, I ain’t cool!” “Did you see the nurse?” “I seen the bitch. I didn’t do nothin’.” [audience laughs] Uh… [chuckling] [clicks tongue] Then it was the process of the therapist. They’d bring therapists for my therapy, and I didn’t want to hear that shit. I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need no fuckin’ therapists. Why did this shit even happen to me? I’m Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx. So, every therapist that came in, I said, “Get the fuck out.” “I don’t want to do this shit.” I… I… I felt like, uh, Wesley Snipes in New Jack City. When he was at the table at the end and Gee Money would walk up. [as Gee] “Yo, you, Nino.” [as Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] “Huh.” “Is that what this is about? Over a fucking skeezer?” “I don’t give a shit about that ho bitch.” [crowd laughs] [scoffs] “Yeah, yeah.” “Don’t nobody know nothing, huh? Hmm, well, I’ll be goddamned.” “Huh. Hmm. Ha. Huh.” [audience laughs] [as Gee] “If you’d have been…” [as Nino] “What?” “If I’d have been what?!” “That’s what I thought you said. ‘Cause that’s all I got.” “Nothin’!”



[audience laughs and cheers]
“Now, leave me.” [imitating Gee] “Yo, Nino.” [imitating Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] That’s my movie. [chuckles] Remember the old dude? [imitating Bill Cobbs] “Your soul is required in hell, young man.” “Look at you in here, sellin’ drugs to your own people.” [chuckles, imitating Nino] “Cancel this bitch. I’ll buy me another one.” “Sit your five-dollar ass down…” [crowd] “Before I make change!” [Jamie] That’s my audience. That’s Atlanta! Huh. Yeah. [crowd cheers] I was Wesley Snipes. I was arrogant. “I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need nothin’. I don’t want to see no therapist.” They say, “You got a second chance.” “I don’t want a second chance.” “What’s wrong with my first chance?” What’s wrong with my first chance? So, I was… irreverent. I was… I gave up. [sniffles] Then… I heard in the other part of the room… I heard ’em go, “We need Holly.” [audience chuckles] Who the fuck is that? “We need Holly for this one. Only Holly can get him goin’.” “Holly is the one.” I’m like, “I don’t give a fuck about no Holly.” “She gon’ get the same shit.” “And she comin’ here on that bullshit.” You know them movies, “It’s only one person could do this.” “We gotta get Holly.” I’m like, “Man, bull-Holly.’
[sniffles]
[audience laughs] I’m layin’ in my bed. That’s all I could do every day. I could walk a little bit, but I couldn’t walk. So it’s early in the morning. I hear, “Get up!” Goddamn! “I’m Holly, motherfucker!”
[audience laughs]
[woman] Oh, damn. I said, “Hey, Holly.” [imitating Holly] “Yes, listen. You gotta knock this shit off.” “This whole Jamie Foxx shit.” “Stop this arrogant bullshit.” “That stroke doesn’t give a fuck about who you are.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker.”
[audience cheers]
[woman] Go, Holly! “All of this ‘I’m Jamie Foxx’ and this Wesley Snipes shit you’re doin’.” “New Jack City.” “Fuck that city.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, and I can get you there, but you gotta tell me the truth and cut this ‘Jamie Foxx’ shit.” I say, “Yeah, miss lady, I’m good.” “Oh, you good?” “You can beat this?” I say, “Yeah.” “Walk to me now.” I said, “Yeah…” [audience chuckles] [woman 1] Aww. [woman 2] Oh. [man] Damn, bro. She said, “I can help you, Jamie Foxx.” [sniffles] “But you gotta tell me what’s really goin’ on with you.” “You’re dizzy, right?” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” “You’re so dizzy, you can’t walk.” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” She says, “You remember the movie Karate Kid?” I say, “Yes.” She said, “We gonna wax on… [with audience]…wax off.”
[audience cheers]
I said, “What that mean?” She says, “I’m gonna help you with that so you can go back to bein’ a man.” She said, “Take your right hand, and put it on your left shoulder.” “Your left hand on your right shoulder. Now close your eyes.” And I fell. She picked me back up. “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “I want you to look left, and I want you to look right.” I look left. I look right. I fell. She said, “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “This is it. Look left and look right.” I look left. I look right. I got that. And then she said, “Now, Jamie Foxx, now you got that? I want you to look up and look down.” I look up, look down, I got dizzy. I fell back in my bed, and I said, “Miss Holly, I don’t want to do this no more, man.” “What has happened to me?” [shakily] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “I don’t want to do this.” And she said, “I got 15 more minutes left.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, motherfucka.”
[applause]
[woman] Holly! “You look left, and you look right.” I looked left, right. She said, “Go to sleep!” [snores] [crowd laughs] The next mornin’… “Get up!” Goddamn, bitch. You gotta get a bell around your neck or somethin’. [audience laughs] She said, “Look left, look right.” Huh? “Look up! Look down!” I said, “Yeah.” “You gotta kill that old Jamie Foxx in order for the new Jamie Foxx to walk outta here.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience cheers] Next morning came, Holly came in. I was already out of bed. “Hey, bitch.”
[audience laughs]
“I knew you was coming, bitch. I’m up!” “Knock it the fuck off.” “Left, right, up, down. Get the fuck outta here.” So I got down again, and Holly took me into the big facility, but there’s other patients in there, and I was down in the dumps. She says, “What’s your fuckin’ problem?” “What is your problem? You don’t want to fight?” She said, “Jamie, when you walk in this facility, look to the left of you, people that ain’t gonna get outta here.”
[audience groans]
And I did. I looked… There was a quadriplegic. There was a person in a wheelchair. There was another guy’s whole side was gone. She said, “They not gettin’ outta here.” There was one little white lady. All she could do was… turn this little pinwheel. She said, “What do you think now?” And I wept. Cryin’. I said, “God, to all the blessings, go over there.” [man] Yes. [Jamie crying softly] So, then they called my… my psychiatrist, Dragana. He knew I was going through some shit. He says, “What’s goin’ on with you? Why can’t we just talk it out?” I said, “Dragana, we can’t, man, ’cause I’m angry.” “I don’t know why this is happenin’ to me.” And as I said that, I knew why this was happenin’ to me.
It was God.
[woman] There it is. [gently] It was God. It was God. I talked to him different. I was like, “Hey, man. You sure you got the right dude?” He says, “Who’s this?” I say, “It’s Foxx!” “Who?” “Foxx!” “Come on, G, it’s J!” “Foxx! Jamie Foxx.” “The one down here puttin’ smiles on people’s faces.” “Who?” I said, “Damn. You want my government name? Eric Bishop.” [audience laughs] “Terrell, Texas? The one that beat the odds, that got the Oscars?” “The one that got the Grammys? C’mon, G. It’s J.” “Come on, man!” He said, “What’s up, my n*gga?” [audience laughs] You can tell by that phrase alone that God is not white.
[crowd laughs]
‘Cause I wouldn’t even let the Messiah call me that. That’s how me and God talk. I said, “Damn, man, you sure? Why am I going through this?” “Is it a clerical error?” “Did Peter write down the wrong name? I mean, did you read it wrong?” “I’m not sayin’… I’m just sayin’, you been at this for a while.” “Maybe you just… read that shit wrong, my n*gga.” [crowd chuckles] He said, “No. This should be happenin’ to you.” I said, “What? Why?” I said, “God, look at all these bad people.” [crowd murmurs] “Look at all these bad people down here.” “Shouldn’t these bad people be goin’ through this?” You know what he said? “Those bad people already belong to somebody else.” [audience exclaims and murmurs] “You belong to me.”
[crowd cheers and applauds]
“Remember when you used to say your grace before you ate your food?” “You belong to me.” “Remember when you played the piano for the church?” “When’s the last time you been to church, my n*gga?” [audience exclaims]
[man] Mm.
[woman] Mm! But I shot back, “God, I get it.” “But the crime don’t fit the punishment.” [crowd laughs] “The crime don’t fit… I’m serious!” “This is too much on me. I’m still down here. I’m gregarious.” “I’m makin’ people laugh, making ’em have fun.” I said, “But look, what this is doin’ to my family, God.” I said, “Look what it’s doing to my kids.” And you know what he said? “You see what they did to my kid?” [audience exclaims]
[applause]
[woman] Heavy. I gave you two beautiful daughters. [man] Amen. That was my only… begotten son. [scattered applause] And then I said, “Man, why you bringing up old shit?” [audience laughs] As soon as I said it, I got dizzy. I said, “Okay, okay!” “G, come on, man! Come on. Knock it off, bro.” “C’mon, my n*gga. I’m just…” “Bro, I’m a kidder!” [chuckles] “Bro, I’m joking. Come one, man.” “Let me out this bitch. Come on, bro.” “I’m fuckin’ around, bro.” “Okay. I didn’t mean to say ‘fuckin’.” I’m foolin’.” “Just let up off me.”
[audience laughing]
And finally, it came to me. It’s about blessings.
[woman 1] Yes.
[woman 2] Right.
God blessed me with this talent.
[man] Amen. He blessed me with all this money and this fame. And when I forgot about God… [woman 3] Mm! …he blessed me with a stroke.
[sound distorts]

[crowd applauding]
[Jamie crying] Just give me one second.
[gospel singer] ♪ Change me, O God ♪ ♪ Make me more like you… ♪
[Jamie] Y’all know I couldn’t wipe my own ass?
[audience laughs]
[sweet tune fades slowly] [hushed] I couldn’t wipe my own ass. That’s what really got me at one point. I went from Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx to, “Okay, lean over.”
[crowd laughs]
“Okay, we’re gonna go in there.” I said, “Damn, y’all gotta go all the way?” Damn, this is… Oh, this is fucked. Ugh. I can’t wipe my own booty… Ass. [inhales sharply] I lost everything. But the only thing I could hold onto was… was my sense of humor. I never let that go. I couldn’t necessarily walk that good. I couldn’t talk that good. But I… But I didn’t let go of my funny. I said, “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” So I was always crackin’ jokes to the point to where the nurses thought I was really losin’ my mind. And I was never myself. Never myself. ‘Cause it’s a wellness check, they ask you who you are. For five days, I was Denzel Washington. I was Denzel. [as Denzel] “All right.” [chuckles] “All right, so that’s what you’re tellin’ me. Okay.” “All right.” [chuckles] “You gotta wipe my ass, huh? Okay.” “All right. Okay.” “That’s what you’re telling me. I had a stroke. Okay.” “All right. You gotta wipe my…” [chuckling] Ah. My nurses. My nurses. [chuckles] “So, you’re tellin’ me… That’s what you’re tellin’ me.” “You gotta wipe my…” “Okay, I’m gonna lean over. Okay. I’m gonna lean over.” [laughs] “I’m gonna lean over. Get on in. Okay. You goin’ too far.” “You get your fuckin’ hands off me!” [crowd applauds] “You think you can do this shit to me?!”
[audience laughs]
“You’ll be serving tapioca pudding in Pelican Bay when I’m done with you!” [audience chuckles] “You had a stroke, sir.” [with audience] “That stroke ain’t got shit on me!” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For three days, I was Dave Chappelle. [imitating Chappelle] “Damn, it’s crazy!” “I can’t believe I came in, they said, ‘Dave, you gone and had a stroke.'” “There’s no way Dave could have a stroke. I was incensed!” “Damn, there’s no way. I’m strong! Said they gotta wipe my ass.” “No way! I’m strong!” “Wu-Tang, n*gga! Pow!” [crowd laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For six days, I was Mike Tyson. [imitating Tyson] “I’m heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “Hello, I’m Mike Tyson. Heavyweight boxing champ of the world.” “Somebody told me I had a sthoke.”
[crowd laughs]
[as nurse] “Sir, it’s ‘stroke.'” [as Tyson] “No, ‘sthoke.’ I had a sthoke.” [as nurse] “You’re not saying it right.” [as Tyson] “I can say it however I want.” “Because I’m Mike Tyson, heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “So, I say, ‘sthoke.'” “You’re not gonna wipe my ass. Nobody’s goin’ near my culo.” [audience chuckles] “They said I had a sthoke.” “And I gotta fight, and I don’t care who I fight.”
“I’ll fight Logan Paul.”
[crowd laughing] “I’ll fight Jake Paul.” “I’ll fight RuPaul. I don’t care who it is I fight.” “Because I don’t get sthokes.” “I give sthokes.” “I be sthokin.'” “That’s what I be doin’.” [laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for like five days, I was Jay-Z.
[crowd exclaims]
[chuckles slightly, imitating Jay-Z] “Last night was crazy.” “It’s crazy. They told me I had an ailment.” “I said, ‘Impossible.'” [audience laughs] “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles slightly] “I started… started off in Marcy Projects, you know.” “Dame had an idea.” “Y’know, he said, ‘Well, you do music.'” “I said, ‘Great.'” “Then later, he came with the clothing line.” [restrained chuckle] “And then I met B.” [awkward, drawn-out laugh] “So, they told me I had an illness. I said, ‘Impossible.'” “They said, ‘Are you mad?’ I said, ‘No.'” “And then they said I need a bedpan.” “And I said, ‘I don’t do bedpans.'” “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles timidly] “And then I shit all over myself.” [audience laughs] [Jamie] “I said, ‘Oh, shit.” “I think I need a bedpan.” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for three days, I was this dude.



[imitating Trump] “There’s lots of great nurses.” “Lots of great nurses. I see the Blacks.” “I like the Blacks.” “They’re hungry. They’re eating dogs.”
[audience laughs]
“They’re eating pets! They’re eating dogs!” “They’re eating pets. I like the Blacks.” “The Haitians. Sak pase.” “Map boule. They’re eating dogs.” “I like all of the nurses. I like…” “I like the nurses. I like the nurses.” “I like ’em. They like me. I like them. I like the white nurses.” [emphatic] “I like the white nurses.” “I like the Black nurses.” “I like all of the nurses. The Black…” “I like… I have a huge, huge Black following.” “I got a huge… There’s a Black. There’s another Black.” “There’s another Black. Oh, Puerto Rican. Same shit.”
[audience laughs]
“I like Kamaya-maya.” “Kamaya-maya Harris.” “I love Kamaya-maya.” “What’s her name? Kamala! Kamala!” “I love Kamala. I love… I love… I love Kamala.” “I love Kamala. I love Kamala.” “She’s Black. She just turned Black. I don’t know where she was.” “She just became Black. She just… ‘Poof, I’m Black!'” “This is fine. If she wants to turn Black, she can turn Black.” “I like her because she’s Black and she’s Indian.” “I like that. I like it.” “She’s mixed. She’s Black. Hey, for real, though. And Indian.”
[imitating Native American chant]
[audience exclaims] [panting] If I can stay funny… [all]…I can stay alive. [crowd cheering] [Jamie clicks tongue] ‘Cause it was touch and go. [clicks tongue] It was touch and go. [clicks tongue] And they told me, uh… They said the first 15 days, they thought they were gonna lose me because my vitals were out of control. [imitates monitor beeping] They said, “We’re gonna lose him.” So it was a 13-or 14-day period where he says, “We gotta keep him calm.” “And we’ve given him every medication. It’s not workin’.” “We have to keep him calm.” “His vitals are so high, we’re gonna lose him.” You know what the worst thing to have when you tryin’ to stay calm in a hospital room? Black family members. [audience laughs] Aka, n*ggas. ‘Cause you know they come in with, “Oh, Lord!” “Good God Almighty!”
“Not my baby! Not now! Not now!”
[alert beeps] “Ooh, good God Almighty! Please save him, Jesus!” My Black family was goin’ so crazy, my white doctor said, “Hey, we need to keep these n*ggas outta here so he can stay alive.” I’m jokin’. He didn’t say that. Now, you know if I was to say that, that’s what TMZ would report.
[imitates news fanfare]
[imitating TMZ announcer] “Jamie Foxx said his white doctor had to call him ‘n*gga’ in order to stay alive.” That’s not what happened.
[audience laughs]
Yeah. All right? He actually said, “Get these Black motherfuckers outta here.” No, I’m kidding. But it was real. My vitals were so bad, they were gonna lose me. And… that’s when a miracle happened, and that miracle was working through my youngest daughter. She’s 14. I didn’t want her to see me like that. But she snuck into my hospital room with her guitar. [crowd] Aww. And she says, “I know what my daddy needs.” [breathing shakily] She said, “That’s my daddy.” What’s interesting is my daughter used to carry her guitar all the time with her. And they said, when she was playing, my vitals… went down. The nurses at the nurses’ station were baffled. Like, “Wow, what did they give him?” So they rushed into the room, and she said, “Shh.” [softly] I got him. My daughter used to carry that guitar when she was ten years old. She would carry it everywhere. She carried it everywhere. I was like, “You gonna carry a guitar?” Going to Disneyland, she got that guitar. [crowd laughs] We going to a football game, she got that guitar. Everywhere we went, she had the guitar. But you know what I found out? It was God in that guitar.
[women] Yes.
[crowd applauds] God was in that guitar. That’s my spiritual defibrillator. [crowd] Aww. [crowd cheering] [woman] Aww! That’s Anelise. When you think about, as you grow older, you wonder about those hard times. Who’s gon’ be there? Who’s actually gonna be there? [crowd] Aww. I don’t have to wonder that anymore.

[audience cheers]
[Jamie] All right. Let’s do it.
[playing mellow tune]
[Jamie] Yeah. Play the guitar.
[woman] Yeah.
[reciting rhythmically] Now, this ain’t no church song But it’s the closest thing to it No, it’s a conversation with God And how he got me through it See, I remember the moment When my blood turned cold And my heart almost stopped My vision was blurred My veins was blocked They rushed me to the doctor But the doctor couldn’t find a plan So my daughter started to cry But my sister threw up her hands And said, “Please, Jesus” “Not right now” “Please Lord, ’cause I don’t know How to live without him” “I don’t have enough tears to cry” “And I don’t have the wings To fly to you to beg you myself” “So, dear Lord, I bow” “Please, don’t take him now” ♪ Don’t take me now ♪
[crowd cheers]

[crowd cheers]
Get your bow. Go get your bravo on.
[cheering continues]
I love you.
[Anelise] I love you too. I… I want to get… I want to get through this. I want to get through this ’cause every time I run into somebody now, that I haven’t seen in a while, I cry. ‘Cause y’all my people. You’ve known me for so long, so every time I run… Especially when I run into my homies. I ran into T.I., I cried. I think he kinda cried… But he was like… [as T.I.] “What you sayin’, my n*gga?” “What you sayin’ with me, partner?” “I pray for you, partner. Period.” “I pray for your partner. I pray for you. I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, partner.” “I prayed expeditiously for you, n*gga.” [audience laughing] But every time I run into somebody, I cry. I ran into T.I., I cried. I ran into Candice Parker, I cried. Then, somehow, I ran into Halle Berry. [audience exclaims] I didn’t cry as much.
[crowd laughs]
‘Cause Halle just rushed me and hugged me so tight. I was like, “Ooh, Lord, have mercy, Jesus.” “This here is Halle Berry.” And she don’t realize how fucking sexy she is. And I don’t want to blow the moment ’cause it was heartfelt. She said, “Jamie, oh my God!” And she hugged me. I said, “Ooh, oh, my gosh.” She said, “There’s so much I wanted to tell you.” And I said, “There’s so much I gotta tell you!” ‘Cause she was huggin’ me. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Please don’t let me disrespect this moment.” So I had to relay… ‘Cause the hug was so nice, I had to relay to my pickle. “Hey, stand down, n*gga. This ain’t that kind of hug.” He shot back, “Shit!”
[audience laughs]
“N*gga, that’s Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” “Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” I’m like, “Man, don’t blow this for me, my n*gga. She’ll feel it!” “Please!” And she’s holding me. She’s talkin’ to me, this close to my ear. I said, “Goddamn!” She right here in my ear. I said, “Damn!” Know how women pretty like that always have a fragrance you’ve never smelled. That shit… I said… [sniffs] “Ooh, what the fuck is that?” “God, this smells like Heaven.” I said… [inhales] I took that shit in, and she was hugging me. I said, “Oh, God, please. Please stay with me, Lord. Please.” “Don’t let me fuck this moment up.” She hugged, and then she… As I tried to pull away, she hugged tighter. Oof. I said, “Good God Almighty.” [crowd laughs] And I could feel my hips. I said, “Hips! Hips, stop! Stop!” But I did just clench up to let her know I’m there.
[crowd laughs]
So she’s huggin’ me, and I’m trying to get out of this moment, and as I’m trying to push away from her heartfelt sexual grip, I tried to push away, know what she did? She kissed me on my neck. [crowd exclaims] And n*gga, I came… [crowd exclaims] …to my senses! [crowd laughing] You nasty motherfuckers. Yo, man, I ain’t finna come like that with Halle. And as she was huggin’ me, “Oh my God, thank you so much.” So Halle, when you see this, please understand what I’m sayin’. You just so beautiful. That’s all we wanna say. Halle you’re beautiful. So she let me go. She let me out of her clutches. I said, “Thank you, Jesus!” But then, I felt a rumblin’. I felt something rumbling. I said, “Ooh, whee!” “I can’t wait.” So I rushed to the bathroom to see what was rumblin’. And I pulled my pants down, and I said, “Oh, shit!” “Somebody back!” [laughs] “Somebody back!” And then I ask him, “Hey, n*gga, what got into you?” Know what he said? “Sometimes, you gotta pop out and show n*ggas.”

[audience laughs] And even when I tried to prove to you that I wasn’t a clone, the internet wouldn’t believe me. At one point, I was on a boat. [audience murmurs] Wavin’ my hand. But what the internet say? “That ain’t no goddamn Jamie. That’s a clone.” [audience chuckles] And then you saw me jump out of a Black woman… I mean, jump out of a… jump out of a bl… Oh, maybe not. Whoa. Look at that. Look at that. I had a stroke, n*gga. Hold on. Hold on. Hold a minute. Then they saw me jump out of a black car, to save a Black woman’s purse.
That’s what I was supposed to say.
