    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

    "Let's take a look at the sentiment of the various transcripts, both overall and throughout the comedy routine."

       "[['comedy ahir shah ends transcript septemberfrom londons royal court theatre acclaimed comedian ahir shah dishes on class family and multiculturalism in the uk from his grandfathers viewahir shah ends genre standup comedy social commentarydirector peter ortonwriter ahir shahstar ahir shahin this standup comedy special ahir shah takes the audience on a personal and cultural journey reflecting on his british indian heritage and family history from childhood memories of watching goodness gracious me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes class and multiculturalism in the uk shah blends humor and poignant storytelling the show covers themes of identity family sacrifice love and the generational impact of immigration all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary in januarya sevenyearold boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents living room in alperton north west london three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the bbc now the boys grandparents had had tough lives right the sort of lives that clad you in an armour and its the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape but for the next half hour the boy and his family watched episode one of goodness gracious me and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember and watching sanjeev bhaskar meera syal nina wadia and kulvinder ghir on television the boy thought wait we can do that i didnt know we could do that but if we get to do that then i wanna do that because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound ive ever heard in my entire life overyears later would you please welcome to the stage mr ahir shahhello hellohello hello hello hellogood evening london are we well fantastic fantastic lovely to have you here lovely to have you in such fine voice hello uh my name is ahir shah that is my name by the way right i didnt used to need to clarify this until a few years ago i was doing this gig in switzerland i was doing a gig in switzerland and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country right i was the british entrant very modernright and there was one comedian i was particularly excited to meet cause this guys name was ali al sayed now ali is a standup comedian from the united arab emirates of all places right id never met anyone from the united arab emirates let alone a comedian from the united arab emirates to be perfectly honest i didnt think they had comedians in the united arab emirates i assumed hed just be walking onstage being like whats the deal with unspeakable oil wealthhes a very nice man a very funny man after the show all the comedians were all backstage hanging out were all having a laugh having a drink not ali obviously right and we get to talking and he says to me like uh listen bro were friends now i can ask you a question youre not gonna get offended im like listen brother youre from dubai im of south asian origin as long as the question you have for me is not do you want a job on a construction siteindustrialised slavery you can ask me whatever the hell you like hes like nothing like that i was just wondering when did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name ahir shah right i was like to be honest i dont remember but it was probably h decemberwhen i plopped out of mrs shah and she and mr shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy ahir i think thats about when i started going by ahir shah hes like right right okay one thing you should know in case youre ever in my neck of the woods is that in arabic your name means prostitute kinghe wasnt even fucking with me ahir shah is prostitute king in arabic there are several reasons i didnt think my career would go stratospheric in saudi humble enough to know that i dont have the best bonesaw material on the circuit thats romesh and fair enough right but uh i put this to the back of my mind for several years as you would until uh novemberi was in egypt doing some work around the cop climate conference they speak arabic in egypt and i dont know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as monarch of all pimpsreally changes the vibe in a lobby in my experience they think youre selling something very different to what you are anyway thats me then ahir shah prostitute king to my friends mr shah to you and uh its been a while since ive done a big show like this a lots changed in the world in my life a lots changed in my life im now very much in my thirties now thats exciting shit started falling apart way younger than i was led to believe by the way i thought i had another good decade left in me as it stands everythings already just crumbling my knees are already fucked absolutely no idea whats going on there im trying desperately to get a referral from my gp right sorry for younger people right um a gp right so a gp was a service where likeyoung fellow how old are you matetwentytwo twentytwo so you might remember but in the same way you remember ipods you never had one but youre vaguely aware they existed okay so basically like a gp was this like right imagine youre a bit poorly not super poorly but a bit poorly what would happen was there was this number you called and someone answered right and uh not even necessarily at eight in the morning any time during business hours very forthcoming uh so youd call them and youd be like oh im a bit poorly and theyd be like ah cool come see us soonright and so a couple of days days a couple of days later what would happen was you went over to this right it looked like a semidetached house it wasnt that was the ',\n",
       "  'first trick they played its like a sphinxs riddle past that you were golden youd arrive like minutes early youre a conscientious person and youd sit in a sort of uh waiting room and after about minutes someone would call your name and youd go to a separate smaller room and there would just be one guy in there and he would be like i mean he would right cause weve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard right and youd tell this person what sort of poorly that you were and this was a very welleducated person so you could just be fixed then and there but occasionally itd be a slightly more complex health need and youd get a referral to a hospital right sorry right a hospital now have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends right that is a building known as a hospitalfunny word isnt it interesting thing you were born in one youll die in one between then youre fucked sorry right uh basically that im obviously being slightly disingenuous there are quite a lot of them generally speaking they were all either built or done up when the prime ministers name was either attlee wilson or blair not sure why not sure why its just a coincidence isnt it what possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things fourteen fucking years fourteen wasted fucking years like not entirely wasted obviously there have been some genuine achievements of conservative government i mean that entirely sincerely by the way my favourite of which is like basically its funny if you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data over the lastyears the tories so successfully decarbonised the british economy and energy mix including all imported emissions that if the countries responsible for the lions share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as weve been over the lastyears global warming basically wouldnt be a thing the tories did that they did it on purpose it is spectacularly impressive and they cant admit it cause they think it sounds gay other than that its slim pickings out there really is genuinely its worse than its been my entire adult life for sure listen the vibes are awful out there were genuinely skint as a collective in a way that we werent incause basically inthe conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the british economy and society that they then spent the nextyears ensuring were true right and is it we need an election yeah we need an election at this stage i would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of oneman dictatorial rule provided that the man in question was martin lewis the money saving expert righti love that guy i love martin lewis the money saving expert so goddamn muchdo you sign up to his emailoh yeah you do youre a good citizen well done sir if you do not sign up for it do your bit for your country that man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink right i love martin lewis the money saving expert so goddamn so for the uninitiated martin lewis hes a moneysaving expert and he runs this website called moneysavingexpertcom and you get a weekly email and its about money saving and the expertise therein right and um basically martin lewis the money saving expert he set up his business for £ right eightzero thats all it cost he is now worthmillion right isnt that amazing he gives a lot away to things like citizens advice cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge i love that for martin lewis i love that martin lewis is rich right heres the thing right the reason i love it is that martin lewis is basically the only person i can think of whos got properly rich from helping do you know what i mean take a second to dwell on how rare that is broadly speaking cause theres no money in helping is there we all know that theres money in hindering for sure right theres no money in helping right whens the last time any of you were walking down the street and went oh my god a lamborghini who does that belong to and someones like the lollipop lady right it doesnt happen cause theres no money in helping unless youre martin lewis because that man is rich as balls and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like pizza express 2 for 1 on wednesday dough balls are on me dont worry about itits gonna take more than martin lewis to save us now the state that were in its really bad out there and its weird for me because at the same time as the country i love is so visibly on its knees i am personally happier than i have ever been in my entire life and the two things are entirely unconnected but still feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful do you know what i mean ive not done it on purpose but its like having chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral the reason ladies and gentlemen that i am happier than i have ever been is that in october of last year i got married yeah honestly shes the single best thing ever to happen to me i love her with all my heart shes a civil servant im in it for the pension you have to understand im a selfemployed man before i met her my retirement plan was just to not live that long whereas now my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day i die right thatll be a new personal best mate in this economy ill try anything right id always known that i wanted to get married eventually i guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well i dont know what to tell you in asian families you get married you stay married its just what happens some of you may know this from your own families maybe friends families you might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the cas',\n",
       "  'e so ill give you the best example i have i started doing standup comedy when i was a teenager right when i was aboutyears old i was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the hackney empire theatre in east london thats a very big theatrepeople some of you may well have been its the coolest thing that had ever happened to me i was on in the first section so i invited my mum my dad and my sister to come watch and they saved me a seat so i could watch in the second section and the reason i was invited in the first place is that the hackney empire were putting on an evening of british asian standup and i as the new kid on the block they were like lets give little ahir a gothats nice isnt it and so the whole audience soldout showpeople all british asian all of the performers british asian apart from right about two hours before the show started one of the acts suddenly had to drop out now this is the noughties its not like nowadays where everyones got email on their phones they had to ring around try and find a replacement a replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian joe bor right now joe is a very nice man hes a very funny man what joe is not is a british asian man right what joe is is a jewish man clearly with two hours on the clock one of the organisers was like fuck ii think jews are basically asian ilisten im not saying there arent similarities between the communities my best mates jewish weve been mates since we wereyears old and its cause the first time we met he told me about his mum and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadnt thought of yet theres one crucial difference between the communities as my friend the comedian joe bor found out to his dismay that evening because my friend the comedian joe bor walked onstage in front ofbrown faces and opened with the line my parents are divorced gimme a cheer if your parents are divorcedfucking nothing not a single sound frompeople i will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my earold ear bless him he has no idea who hes talking toso what happens in asian families for better or for worse you get married you stay married i come from a very long line of very longmarried people uh my parents met at a mutual friends birthday party in india infell in love at first sight my dad proposed that night they have been married for almostyears right um by the standards of my mums family by the way my parents had had quite an extensive courtship uh prior to that i mean like well her parents my maternal grandparents nanaji and nanima i mean the first conversation they had with one another just like oneonone was on the night like several hours after they were already married right itsin india it was arranged i dont know what to tell you like they werent complete strangers to one another that would be silly its like the families had exchanged a photograph uh right and um these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them imagine getting shown that when youre likeis this who youd like to marry foreveroh yeah i guessthen in the end very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young its so funny talking about this in front of liberal london audiences like its just like you all know that outwardly you have to be like oh the mysteries of the east uh a rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our owninternally youre all just thinking thats fucking barbaricthe thing is thats fucking barbaric sorry you mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information and within a matter of days they were in bed together that is fucking disgusting we would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary enlightened westernsorry just because youve decided to do it via algorithm not old woman in your village does not make it less arranged right all youve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable all right my wife and i obviously had a far more conventional relationship uh prior to getting engaged meeting in this country and whatnot it took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question as they say mate we were going out five weeks and i asked her to marry me um i get shit done theres no point pissing about if you know you know so just get it get it done no point leaving stuff on your todo list for six months things are worth doing quickly and well its the single best decision i ever made absolutely no downside admittedly we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because like our tenancy agreements didnt spent half my life on a fucking bus then eventually obviously we were able to finally move in together but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in london joining households so now we rent one roof that contains two copies of every ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownershipi love my ottolenghi books though not giving those up even for a house might need the spares love my ottolenghi books hey mate you got an ottolenghi bookah yeah i love ityeah thats the sort of thing you can afford when you get the martin lewis email love my ottolenghi booksfor this recipe you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a persian widowor if they dont have that in a shop near you just any limethe thing is you think its bullshit but i got some of the widow limes and you can taste the grief its good stuff actually the salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour i think that shy of having children with someone i think getting engaged getting married its like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on t',\n",
       "  'he future just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of themthats an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel right at the same time as it feels like were embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime it feels like the country around us has just given up you know what i mean its very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders isnt it it is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country right thats weird enough for me as were beginning this optimistic journey but its doubly weird when i think about the fact that if i were able to get into a time machine and travel towhen my grandfather younger than i am now became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores and i would just explain the present to him he would not believe me because he would think i was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress so thats really what im trying to do to take a step back view things through a wider lens a generational lens get some perspective not be so blinkered try not to lose the wood for the trees cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the british indian community i think thats a very relevant story to the past present and future of this country right british indians are by a very long margin the largest minorityethnic group in this country hindus again were talking about millions upon millions none of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate nish right and the story of the indian community in this country by and large starts as it did for my family in theand has ended up in thewith us now running everythingrishi bhai did itrishi bhai did it never thought id live to see the day that rishi bhai did itgot that big house in the middle of town now babyrishi bhai did itlisten politically im furious racially thrilled ah are you kidding me on an ethnic level couldnt be happier for him and his family increasingly worried about mine very much how i used to feel every time i saw suella aunty on the television jesus christ calm down suella aunty youre gonna get us both killedright uh im gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit obviously ive got to be relatively careful what i say about him because we can all agree theres about achance that a decade from now i will play him in a channel 4 drama right right not gonna burn a bridge before ive even crossed it are you kidding me i need that money i just wish that i could get across like how wild that day was right i a british indian devout hindu son of immigrants became prime minister of britain on diwali that was a very difficult day in the family whatsapp for me get the family whatsapp up on my phone yes its called the asian network see dad is typing wait for the inevitable ahir have you seen what mr sunaks son has done today still ahir you enjoy mocking your week im sure thats nice for youim glad the shines come off him now everyone knows hes not really up to it at the beginning you all acted like he was the perfect indian boy at the beginning everyone acted like he was the perfect indian boy its cause you just go off the cv on paper right you dont know what i know what does it say on the cv fucking anyone couldve done that what piece of piss who cares what all right fair enough whats the guy done fair enough does well at school gets into oxford does well at oxford gets into stanford does well at stanford starts working in finance becomes a multimultimillionaire in his own right in his twenties largely through executing positions as a big short inthat makes him rich enough that hed never have to work again no one even reflects on that cause at stanford he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine indian billionaire whos a very successful businesswoman in her own right they move to the united kingdom where he becomes an mp at an obscenely young age chancellor at an obscenely young age during one of the worst financial crises this countrys experienced then prime minister at an obscenely young age of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors leading to complex migratory patterns in his familys case via east africa landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith and everyone acts like hes the perfect indian boy feel free to look this up it is genuinely true rishi sunak never made his school cricket team i was captain of minethats right that is right any indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me all right know what i meanwho cares about rishi sunak i want ahir tendulkar mmmhearing a lot about number ten should be batting at number fourthats classyhis family came here in thetoo like i i think about that sometimes getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then not only would this be the case but i think the bit that hed struggle with the most is that its not a thing do you know what i mean the news was just like and the prime minister rishi sunak and everyones like yeah that makes senseit is remarkable how unremarkable it is right thats a thing thats worth reflecting upon listen ill always talk about the things we do badly as a country i think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country and i do think that when were at our best britain stands basically alone certainly in europe probably in the world as an example of what a properly successful multiethnic multicultural democracy can l',\n",
       "  'ook like in practice in the t century thats something that is worth discussing its why i hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes its why i cant stand it when people on my own team right i dont like teams in the first place but listen i voted remain but whenever people are like it was only the european union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency tofuck off anyone else in the room ever been to continental europe while not white its not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy genuinely a couple of years ago i had to go to this wedding in france i genuinely the way people were i kept asking people i was with like i thought i had something on me turns out i did gonna get an algerian president of france anytime soon or reckon the fashll get there first same question for germany you know listen i think that britain stands basically alone in this thats worth reflecting on right i remember when i wasyears old walking across the meadows on the south side of edinburgh with my friend the indian american comedian hari kondabolu right i said to him hari bhaii think that when youre part of any sort of visible minority whatever that minority might be what you fundamentally want in life its not necessarily different treatment or special treatment rather it is the ability eventually to get to go without saying to be part of what is just to sort of get to be normal i think if you get to be normalyou probably dont realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time and does political representation get us there in and of itself of course it doesnt right we know this for a fact rishi sunak not even the first pm from a minorityethnic background first way back in the h century benjamin disraeli also a tory right would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary britain that would be a fucking stupid thing to say but maybe these things are indicative of the fact that in societies we can over time move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone which is where it shouldve been in the first fuckin place i have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes i have been to many countries cities continents doing this and i can comfortably say that britain is yes as the cliché goes the least racist country in the worldit just says a shitload more about the world than about britain right and please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point i think the guys a fucking appalling prime minister hes like genuinely terrible and no one voted for any of this it is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment i do not agree with his politics but by the way thats when you know that something historics happened people use phrases like i may not agree with the politics butno one felt the need with david cameron its just nice for someone like that to get a girl isnt it right but sunak and cameron are basically the same guy cause they went to fancy school thats what explains it fancy school and fancy school runs the country that is not the school that i think about when i think about the prime minister the school that i think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away in aprilan event occurred in amritsar punjab at the time british india that is now known to history as the jallianwala bagh massacre also known as the amritsar massacre this is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very very small area and tens of thousands of rounds of machinegun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians at leastof whom were murdered probably many more though well never know the true total and thousands more had lifedefining injuries thereafter it is one of the worst and most welldocumented cases of colonial atrocities of british rule in india ive known about that a very long time what i did not know about until an investigation in the times last year was that subsequent to the massacre in amritsar there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings including one that happened in a place called gujranwala right now gujranwala its aboutmiles away from amritsar its a border town in contemporary pakistan and in gujranwala again thousands of rounds of machinegun fire were let out at entirely unarmed just farmers tilling their fields and over the course of two days ten bombs were dropped including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of this is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you so dont you even think about trying to fuck with usone of the survivors of the massacre in gujranwala was a twoyearold boy named ramdas ramdass grandson is at time of recording prime minister of the united kingdom of great britain and northern irelandyeah when when i think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations i think about the school in gujranwala rather more than i think about winchester college a punchline would feel distastefulright obviously i wasnt alive at the time but i reckon the way i feels basically how a lot of women felt about margaret thatcher inyou dont need to agree with someones politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself and thats the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow and yo',\n",
       "  'u cant deny that it works you cant deny that it listen weve now had enough whitelady prime ministers that theyre allowed to be instantly shit that is a staggering achievement for equality in this country are you kidding me maggie and theresa walked so liz could fly liz truss actually very important from a representational standpoint as well uh i mean that entirely sincerely too think about how many prime ministers there mustve been over however long its been did you know that liz truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school isnt that mad right likeof children go to a regular comprehensive school i went to a regular comprehensive school i believeof prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school admittedly she wasnt a great advert for us right i may not agree with her politics butin case youre trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent youre currently enjoying uh well uh what ended up happening there was i went to my local comp in wembley north west london i had a wonderful time there but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other very thoughtful of them subsequent to that i ended up going to the university of cambridge so i became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman uh uh a few years ago i was doing a tv record in glasgow and afterwards i was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian jamali maddix i was there with jamali smoking making small talkhe went you went private school yeah im like oh no i didnt whatso i talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood and he just looked at me and went hang on bruv are you from ends well jamali one supposes one wasim not gonna do it down i grew up in a wonderful place i went to a wonderful school i hate when people do that down i genuinely it was a really good school if you avoided gang violence cousin marriage it was ofsted good like it was a great environment all the families by and large like mine first secondgeneration immigrants parents may not have had a lot to give what they had was the most important an insistence that education is the best way onward upward outward i think if youve gotgrand thats a better thing to give to a child and blessed with really great teachers ill tell you about one of my favourites miss lewis now miss lewis i think she had previously taught at a private school i dont know but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead maybe thought that was unfair right and so she set up off her own initiative like all great teachers do off her own bat she set up for a couple of years an additional optional latin class of all things and i as you can probably imagine was heavily involved this is what i mean about the transformative power of education you could change everything for young people in an instant i still remember like it was yesterday the first time i walked into that gleaming portakabin bestowed on us by new labour and i sat down and i opened these textbooks that contained these things that id never even conceived of before i was just there being like oh my god its true caecilius est in hortodo you know what i mean right led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school which was one time at the end of term my boys and i were gonna go cinema cause you get a half day the way that you go to the cinema you get thefrom brent town hall so we were walking to the bus stop and on the way to the bus stop theres this blind alley right and a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit until one of them just stopped all of the others by going guys ahirs safe yeah i know him from latini sincerely believe i am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of latin class uhnathaniel gratias tibi its a great environment to grow up in you know not much cash but a lot of ambition i think thats a good way around to have it generally speaking and realistic ambition as well the families just had realistic ambitions the sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on the idea that if everyone does their bit works hard the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did that is a reasonable ambition parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children right now this is not an unreasonable ambition i know all about unreasonable ambition you dont need to tell me about i remember once when i was at uni entirely unironically telling my mate ali that by the time i was in my thirties i wanted to be gq magazines worlds best dressed man right i am now in my thirties and will settle for dressed man and thats a stretch most days listen we all know fundamentally that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment i think that the part that weve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice now i might not know much about generational investment yet but i feel like through example i at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school i would go to my grandparents house in alperton north west london and i would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of nanaji and nanima now quick note on language i speak another language its called gujarati nanaji just means your mums dad you have different words for both sides of the family so maternal grandfather thats nanaji as you can imagine i write a lot of stuff on my computer my computer refuses to accept the existence of the word nanaji and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word navajo which has led to three instances where i alone at home have yelled at a computer screen wro',\n",
       "  'ng sort of indiannow nanaji was the first member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties inhe is probably the reason that i was born here in the first place he is the reason for so much even though he died a fair while ago now hes probably the largest part of the reason why i ended up sounding like this right when he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country he said to the children including my mother listen when youre outside youre not allowed to speak to one another in gujarati any more you live somewhere called england now so you need to learn how to speak like proper little englishmen and women and then if you learn how to do that maybe one day theyll learn how to accept youand it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears but this was a very commonplace thing in theanda sort of like vocal version of dressing for the job you want you ever heard that phrase right and this has been entirely useless for me but like my uncle is a doctor can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me youd be fucking thrilled imagine that hes doing the ward rounds just like oh good morning how are we feeling today youre thinking this motherfuckers gonna cure me in two hours make lunch plansnow nanaji could never integrate in that way himself so i think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically english jobs right so for the most part of his career until he retired he worked at john lewis worked on the shop floor selling curtains fabrics cause its what he knew from the textile factories back in india thats probably the most english place anyone could possibly work youre not gonna get a more english place to work than the john lewis partnership unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big red bus fair play thats the most english place anyone could possibly work you cant hit us with a more english workplace than the big red busunless the first job you had in this country was literally at the bakedbean factory its where it all started bakedbean factory in bradfordbaby came over here work on those beans now uh crucially he did not want to uh right by that stage been married for just under a decade had three children had friends enjoyed his work in the textile factory thought he might be able to work his way up and everything very little interest in the united kingdom hitherto no interest in beans right but um it was my grandmother who pushed this like nani quite understandably was like listen just india at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of and so she quite understandably was like listen these children arent gonna have the life we wanna give them over here but theyre taking people in england so i need you to go over there you just work it out right ill stay here with the children you send money back to us when youve saved up enough well come join you all right cool see you later byeuh he just did it like pretty soon thereafter just went like listen i like to think that im gonna be a pretty sort of accepting thoughtfultype of husband right however if just under a decade from now my wife is to tell me that i must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when i would see them again no way of communicating with them no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety that would not be the end of the conversation right however of course for nanaji it was how could it not be thats your dharma thats your duty you have to do it its your duty to your family right so he came over not entirely on his own came with a couple of other guys who did the same left the wives and kids but they didnt really see each other that much for a few years cause they ran a system called the eighteighteight right the eighteighteight is a system whereby as mathematicians in the room can confirm if three men each have two jobs the shifts of which are eight hours long and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work one guy finishes his second shift comes back hits you awake you go off to your first one he falls asleep do that again and again saves twothirds on the rent thats more that you can send to the wives and kids in india and thats the largest expense isnt it whats the secondlargest expense probably food but food taken care of cause at the bakedbean factory they give you a tin of beans protein very important for the second meal of the day they had a big sack of rice and theyd have some boiled rice in a pot apart from sundays obviously because sunday is treat day so the boiled rice contained an onion right some of you are probably thinking surely even inonions are cheap anyone could have onions whenever they wantedfrom what you have heard so far about my nanima do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a sevenaweek onion habit its what you needed to do its what they needed you to do so its what you did eighteighteight five five years he didnt see his wife or children for five years imagine that its not like at least ive got a good data plan or something like that forget about calling that was never gonna happen letters couple of letters a year each time you write one you feel a bit closer every time you buy a stamp youre driving them further away to the extent that my mums first memory in this country is heathrow airporther her brother and sister all sort of hid behind their mum because they were just like whos this man right whos this big man right just like w',\n",
       "  'hys he smiling at me whys he got these tears in his eyes i guess he looks like that photograph that mummy cries over sometimes if anyone ever hums that song you knowi think about that a lot too right imagine that trying to raise three children on your own for five years occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters shouldve cried over a lime shed have made some money family reunited inthe year after a very prominent conservative politician got on a soapbox in birmingham and said we must be mad literally mad to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrantdescended population it is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre now mr powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrantdescended population because thats quite a mouthful my sister and i tend to go with mumimagine that bringing your wife and kids into that the year after rivers of blood when youve been here on your own sincethe same year as the smethwick campaign right its fucking grim right just like the violence the aggression that goes without saying its also its always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest yeah the thing i suppose like nowadays we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually uh accused of quite serious theft from the workplace uh which was like suspended and investigated for ages entirely cleared hed obviously not done it but it didnt take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like who do you reckon theyre gonna believe ehimagine what that does to you like your dignity and stuff you have to do it again though tomorrow you have to get up brave face for the kids for the kids its not like the kids have it any easier there has been so much more progress in the lastyears in this country than there was in thethat preceded it and i feel very comfortable saying that because i went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle my abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when i didnt get mugged cause of latin hahaha my uncles abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it my mums abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something she has to change her clothes entirely cook eat change her clothes entirely again no matter how many times i tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank and he died inso he died only remembering the shit bit and he wasnt old so if hed just hung on he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different you could have at least seen a bit of that before you left right inim on a train reading a newspaper sorry mate a newspaper right um imagine like a solid tweet right and and on a train reading a newspaper and its the day before the mayoral election in london and theres this big feature article uh where basically sadiq uncle is walking around the city meeting the various voters and talking to them in the feature theres this one guy ive forgotten his name it was a west african name i think hes there with his fiveyearold son and he says to him son i want you to shake this mans hand this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of londonand in that moment of reading that like my hands stopped working and the paper fell from my hands and the tears fell from my eyes as i thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london was completely impossible right and yetyears later it had become totally inevitable so what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper what would he have made of reading a sentence like that what would he have made of reading the words this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london probably not much i dont think he really liked muslims i may not agree with his politics but and thats how i felt diwali before last you know lit my divo i went outside i went back into the kitchen and i poured a little glass of whisky and i said you finding today interesting ehits like obviously problems still exist none of this is to negate any of the problems that were all too aware of right but at the same time pretending that the sort of stuff that i have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged and its worth acknowledging cause theyre the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible right im not an idiot i wander around doing this for a living all around the country occasionally people shout ignorant shit at me in the street like im not oblivious to that and listen my wife is a white irish lady sometimes the two of us are going about our business out and about and people see us together they dont like that too much they make their opinions known theyre all so fuckin old right so old like proper fossils and when i was a teenager it would really like id be ready to fight and now a part of my brain just cant help but think f i think maybe you lost right no not lost isnt correct cause its not like societys a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the results been but at ',\n",
       "  'the very least i can acknowledge that im not the one who scored the goals im a sub theyre the ones who scored the goals they scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day they were stilltwo down right and is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us its worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is right because you see people young people trying once again to sow sort of any sorts of division in this society were trying to build and you just think what the fuck are you doing what are you doingsurely the point if the point is anything the point is to create a society in which one day everyones children get to go without saying i think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that thats possible and i refuse to be anything else its so easy to despair right despair is the easiest position to have its definitely my default it just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion right try something else yeah my wifes way better than me at this like shes just generally speaking quite stable and well adjusted i used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something turned out its because she has absolutely no socialmedia presence whatsoever uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work if we were all slightly more like her wed all be slightly less fucking insane by the way no ones changed their names theres no mrs shah to this story fortunately for all of us in irish her name means prostitute queendidnt even take five weeks not really there was a point one week stood opposite her in the kitchen and just all of a sudden its like the trailers stopped like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers and all of a sudden every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison shhshhshhshhshhshhshh shhthe pictures about to start and now i get to see how it goes thats it i mean the endings gonna suck right im not gonna know too much about it thoughgonna die first get in love it are you kidding me listen its like shes really like oh no we shouldnt have processed food in the house and all i want to do in my life is fuck a chicago town pizza while chainsmoking and doing lines of salt its nice to feel like youve had one of your last beginnings yeah frees you up to think about where things end up its the interesting thing with love right love the way that it begins begins in as many ways as there are people if we were ever to have a conversation and you said to me ahir can i just check were you in love on your wedding daywouldnt that be a ridiculous question youd never ask cause the answers obviously yes right what i find fascinating is that if you were ever to meet my grandmother and you were to say ramila can i check on your wedding day were you in loveit would be an equally ridiculous question cause the answer would obviously be no of course she wasnt right there she was little more than a girl sat opposite little more than a boy total strangers functionally of course she didnt love that boy right and yet it began it began right wild did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day of course she didnt right did she love the young man just under a decade later who was willing to move continents because he knew thats what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment of course she loved that man she loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters of course she loved that man she loved that man in heathrow airportthe photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them of course she loved that man she loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions she loved that man as they danced together shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible for the next decades until his end she loved that man she loved that man inand well past that as you will know if you go to a living room in alperton north west london and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit of course she loves that man thats where it ends up nanaji died ina week after his birthday hed just turnedoihed brought a slightly hastened end onto himself really uh basically when he retired he wanted to spend as much time in india as humanly possible but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills the place in india my family are historically from a city called ahmedabad its incredibly polluted makes central london look like the fucking peak district and so he would go over there and come back weaker diminished and he came back and after the second trip his grownup children had to get him sat down in his own living room and my mum had to say to her own dad you are killing yourself right thats whats happening here thats whats its perfectly clearyou go there you come back youre weaker youre smalleryoure more diminishedand can you not see what is happening to youits not even about seeing akshay is a doctorhe can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose youdo you not feel what is happeningso heres the thing youve had your fun youve had two tripsbut now you stay over here right cause we love you very much so we wanna keep you aroundthats how were all gonn',\n",
       "  'a look after one anotherso youve had your fun but youre not allowed to go any morehere you are good yesand he had to look at three adult children and say noi never wanted any of this right i never wanted anylike my entire life it turns out has just been this means to an end and thats fine its fine because you are the endso if i had to do it again i would with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face i would do it againbut can you not understand that i just need this at my endi can feel it far more than you can see it or he can hear itdo you not understand i dont carei dont care because when i go over there no one looks at me like im any different or yells at me or spits at me like im any different because im not any differentwhen i go over there i am a normal guyi have been a normal guy since the day i was borni just havent felt like it in so longyou dont understand that when im over there i get to go without saying and i havent gone without saying since nineteen sixtyfuckingfourhe used to run off the plane as quickly as possible sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him and go to the first part of the airport that wasnt paved over fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands he would dig up the earth and he would put it in his mouth can you imagine dig the earth and put cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth but you had to leave you had to leave because thats what they needed and if they needed it its what you had to do he would dig the earth and put it in his mouth it cant have helpeda third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying and it killed him thats how much every human being wants that you need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them when he did die he died in this country in a hospital dyou remember hospitaland my mother was next to him sat down he was in a bed not speaking any more it was just the beeps you know most of us have heard the beeps and a nurse came by saw my mum and said oh you must be mr vaishnaws daughter she said yes i am and the nurse said well listen im new to the ward so i didnt get a chance to speak to him but ive spoken to some of the other nurses who did and they said he was a good manand my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in heathrow airport inand said he was the best of men and the line went flat and if nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men and like objectively he wasntdo you know what i mean not a baddie but just you know a normal complex flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room and probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for i suppose yeah but for someone for someone which it turns out is the only way that you can be of course he was he was the best of people for someone he did what they needed from him when they needed it from him he did the best that he could for the people he loved if you can do that then you can be the best of people for someone if you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you then you damn well get to go without saying in my book it is not that i have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement the truth is what the truth always was in the first place which is that the sacrifice is the achievement and with that in mind i know full well that till my end krishnadas vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man i will ever meet i have wanted to do this since januarysat on the floor of my grandparents living room in alperton north west london listening to nanaji and nanima laugh at episode one of goodness gracious me and for just over a decade i have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career but its not the job not any more and it never will be again i hope the job as i understand it is what nanaji understood the job to be he was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be he was the best of men and i am now in front of you the worlds best dressed manbecause i get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat because i am finally dressed for the job i want and it will be the hardest job of a lifetime but with you nanaji ill be

happened to this gorillaooh okay so theres this gorilla named koko has everyone heard of koko the gorillayes some for yeses koko the gorilla for those of you that dont know is a gorilla that spoke fluent sign language and inthis is true koko met robin williams and a couple of years ago they told koko that robin williams had passed away and koko went koko friend koko sad awyes which is sad but on the plus side how funny was robin williams that even gorillas are like this guyhes unbelievable my comedy barely works if youre not from the upper west side robin williams crossed the species barrierbrilliant comedian also and obviously did they have to tell the gorilla that robin williams had passed away she wasnt gonna catch it on cnn or anything like that i heard about this in like september ofand i couldnt stop imagining somebody walking into a gorilla enclosure just like no ill do it ill do it let mehi kokocan you put down the banana we have some bad news and they tell koko and kokos like oh nobut prince is fine right like get the gun koko koko calm down and kokos like why was the last david bowie album so sadand theyre like koko and kokos like what else do you know– and theyre like koko no and kokos like and theyre like koko no and kokos like who is the president right now those are the kind of jokes i write i write jokes that are so dumb and simple that part of it is like oh i cant believe someone took the time to think about that i cant believe that someone thought that was worth informing an audience of i cant believe– this is true sadly that in the middle of a pandemic someone spentdollars on sign language lessons over zoom for a joke about a gorilla i love a dumb joke i love a silly joke its my job its my currency i wrote a joke a while ago that was so dumb it took a month and a half to realize it was actually too dumb to ever grace a stagehere it is i dont think ive ever seen a fat horse i dont think ive ever seen a fat horse maybe thats because they get four times as many steps as we doi i know i know and a month and a half later i was walking through a whole foods and out of nowhere i was like twice as many steps they dont have eight goddamn legsits twice as many steps and thats what this show was gonna be when i started writing it it was gonna be a show full of benign silliness like ive done my whole comedy life and then something happened so i write radio comedy shows for the bbc nobody listens to these thingsno one people my age dont even know what a radio comedy show is like ill tell people i write radio comedy shows and theyre like whats a radio comedy show and i have to explain that its like a podcast but for the dying and like this radio show comes out and theres this massive wave of indifference right no one cares its a radio comedy show but there are two tweets just two and one tweets actually very nice its very complimentary because the tweet is from my aunt nancy in teaneck new jerseyand it said– her fans are everywhere of course and the second tweet is from someone im not related to and this guys just listened to the show and this guys very upset and this guys very upset largely by the fact that i am a jew and sometimes people can tell that im jewish because of my name or my face or anything about my personality but this guys very upset by the fact that im jewish and he lets me know and i make a mistakei respond to the tweet i know and then he writes back and then i write back and then he writes back and then other people get involved and then i go to bed and i wake up the next morning and my twitter feed its just this avalanche of antisemitism nothing but anti– and it bothered me its never fun to see that stuff directed at you and then it stopped bothering me because i started adding these people to a twitter list do you guys know what i mean generally when i say twitter lists a couple of yeses a couple of blank stares all right fine by the way you dont you dont need to know what this is i promise you its an obscure function of a dying platformlike you dont truly need to know but on twitter– yeah but on twitter the way it works is you follow folks you know that you follow people everybody knows but imagine youre interested in like a common area imagine youre interested in like opera or the nba but you dont feel like following a whole bunch of nba players what you can do is you can make a list of nba players and then follow that list and check it occasionally right so i did that but with antisemites and because of certain issues within the nba at the moment there would indeed be some crossover between the two lists but i made this list of antisemites and i like it immediately i like it for two reasons reason number one let them be on a list for onceokay okay even schindler not a jew we make the list now and reason number two these guys got a notification when they were added to the listand the name of this list and they saw this when they were added was jewish national fund contributors and i got so many tweets from antisemites going take me off your goddamn listi have never contributed to the jewish national fund and i would always write back theres still time were planting a million trees outside of haifa be part of the zionist dream and i love my list i love my list for these two silly reasons but then i get to love it for a third reason which is that its got all of the worst opinions on it and thats one of the reasons you go on social mediaright you wanna be offended right same reason you ',\n",
       "  'watch cable news youre not a moron you know youre not getting real news but you get to be upset right you get to be upset at something someone on the other team did or didnt do or something they did or didnt say and i have a list i have a digital terrarium of assholes and occasionally with great sanctimony obviously i go down the list and be like oh my god thats so racist oh my god thats so sexist oh my god thats so homophobic i dont have any of these opinions im such a good boy anyway its a tuesday night and im doing my favorite thing when im alone my favorite thing to do is i lie on my couch and i hold my phone like an otter like an inch from my face do you know what i mean just a brisk nine ten hours in a row just going like this and i see this tweet from someone on the list and the tweet says heyhey if you live in nyc and you have questions about your whiteness come toh avenue which is in queens tomorrow night at and i saw the tweet and i thought to myself i live in nyc and as an ashkenazi jew i have some questions about my whiteness and im free tomorrow night atand i took a screen grab i took a picture of the tweet and i sent it to my best friend in the world this guy named david burstein and i wrote david do you wanna come with me to this meeting of nazis in queens and i saw the three dots on the iphone that means someones texting you back and then the dots disappeared then they reappeared then they disappeared again and then he called me and he said whats going on and i said im gonna go to this nazi bar and he said why and i said im gonna listen to everything they have to say i will learn something itll be fascinating illuminatingand hes like youre so brave and i was like i know i am so brave and the next night aroundi take the subway into queens and i get off and i walk to the address of this nazi bar and its not a barits an apartment building and i thought to myself how brave are we it was january it was so– i stood outside this building freezing dithering for likeminutes being like maybe im an idiot maybe my mouth is writing checks that my butt cant cash and there was one moment where i was like well obviously im in the wrong place but i knew i wasnt i knew i was in the right place cause there was a sign on the front door of this building and the sign just said third floor but it said it in comic sans font the most radical of all the fonts and after a while i sort of rediscover the intestines that i left on the 7 trainand i go upstairs to the third floor of this building and theres this long corridor long doors on either side of me overhead lighting bad and theres one open door in this hallway and when i walk in the first thing i see in the foyer of this apartment is this older lady shes in her seventies at least or like eighties but she moisturizesand like and shes got this table in front of her and on this table is the biggest jigsaw puzzle i have ever seen a jigsaw puzzle heres how big it is when i walked in and i saw the puzzle involuntarily i just went oh wow and without looking up she wentpieces she knew exactly what i was talking about from oh wow and i said thats so much puzzle and she went this isnt even all of it this is like a quarter of the puzzle ive been working on this part for like six months and i thought to myself you should be further into that puzzle probably although maybe white supremacists jigsaw puzzles are harder you know cause like all the faces look the same shes sitting im standing were making small talk about her tonnage of puzzand like— and she tells me how much like the puzzles mean to her and for what its worth i like jigsaw puzzles and i like people that do them like its a very like thoughtful fulsome exercise there arent a ton of those left and its even like a tidy metaphor for why im here right like— because as with the world with a puzzle you need every piece for a complete picture you need every piece for a full perspective if youre missing even one piece of your puzzle it is suspect or worthless but even a metaphorical puzzle i can do quicker than this lady like shes making zero progress and at some point she just went you know the last one of these took like three years and i said last one and she points behind herself down this hallway and i follow her finger and as i go down in i pass two enormous framed framed jigsaw puzzles framed and then to my right theres like a threshold like a doorway with no door and when i walk through this threshold im in this living room and its like a its a pretty spacious living room and theres like a hodgepodge of chairs around and folks are walking around talking and of all– oh and to my– sorry to my left theres like a big table of like pastries and orange juice and even though i was a little scared i was like oh sick pastries so im eating this whites only muffin and on the other side of the room i see this cute girl and this is how dumb of a moron i am i saw the girl and i thought to myself with no irony you never know you never know right you gotta shoot your shot so i put down my racist pastry and i went over and i said hi im alex and she went oh hi im chelsea and we start chatting and its good chat but a few moments in chelsea just went ah hey alex the white house hmm and i thought to myself this could go anywhere i actually have a thing for this i have a thing for this if anyone ever asks you a question and you know they want a specific answer from you but youre not sure what that answer is there are four words that will save you every single time every– sir sorry to bother you would you mind asking me if i saw the game last night did you see the game last night oh can you believe itwell done that was very nice okay very nice can you believe itguys this works its amazing can you believe it it means peoples three favorite things in a conversation it means i know what youre talking about i agree with you and most importantly you talkit works every single time by the way im from new england there is a new england version of this if youre ever caught in a stalled conversation with a new englander just go fucking brady rightit works every single time but this is better it is evergreen can you believe it i have a neighbor in la i never know what hes talking about i use this in every conversation with him hell be like oh recycling and ill be like can you believe it and hes like they should take it out on thursdays and ill be like okay or hell be like minor league baseball and im l',\n",
       "  'ike can you believe it and hes like they should pay the players more and im like absolutely and my favorite one ever this is like six months ago he just went hey alex the kennedy assassination and i was like can you believe it and he said bobby did itand i was like oh well he got his didnt he i mean can you believe it it is a mirror of a question of an answer and it works here because she just went the white house hmm and i said can you believe itand she went off on this rant about jared kushnertrumps jewish soninlaw and she goes off on how kushner and his friends are ruining the trump administration and the country and i so had to stop myself from doing what i desperately wanted to do which was go oh i hate jared kushner he sits behind me in synagogue on the upper east sidehes so goddamn loud thats true by the way itspercent true kehilath jeshurun on h and lexington its where he goes hes fucking loudand hes arrogant thats the word hes so– like when they call him up to the torah he walks up like he wrote it hes got a problem im telling you and– anyway shes off on her rant about the kushim standing there im nodding im trying to focus more on the face less on the opinions you know and we talk for likeminutes and she does most of the talking which is a red flag but not a deal breaker you know and after aboutminutes i feel someone kind of like lurking in my periphlike im being haunted and when i turn around theres this guy standing there and this guys sizing me up with a look on his face that i would honestly most accurately describe as this is a jew like im pretty sure this is a jew and he said to me hey can i help you as if i was gonna be like yes well i was on my way to synagogue for yom kippur but i got lost and i stumbled in here do you know if these muffins is kosher but i tried to be neutral and i said hey man and he said can i help you and i said im here for the thing and he said youre here for the meeting and i thought about saying can you believe it but i had just used it so i said yeah man im here for the meeting and he said chelsea hes with you and chelsea just went oh we just met but he seems cool and i thought to myself niceyou never know right and then this guy like fumfers for– like this guys not quite sure what to say but when he recovered he just said okay all right but who is he excuse me who are you like whats your name heres the thingheres the thing growing up i always wanted to be whiteyeah yes im aware there are a few of you looking at me like mission accomplished buddy does he not i am white im definitely white but i grew up in a place where there were different kinds of white people i grew up in a place where there was a strict hierarchy for whiteness i grew up in boston i grew up in this really racist part of boston called bostonand in boston and in boston there are different kinds of white people there are different kinds of whiteness right like there are ashkenazi jews like me and were in places like brookline and newton and an outer suburb way to the south called sharon there are the russians in eastie in east boston there are the greeks in dorchester there are the italians in the north end and of course irish catholics right ics practically synonymous with boston and theyre scattered all over but a lot of them very famously concentrate in anybody know southie southie south boston yes and theyve had an amazing century no truly an incredibleyears for the bostonian irish catholics theyve gone up a couple of socioeconomic classes as a whole theyve had their own president who was apparently killed by his brotherright like theres any reason but theyve not ascended to the top of this totem pole cause at the top of this pyramid of bostonian caucasian unquestionably waspswasps exactly the wasps and let me tell you that is the kind of white you wanna be in boston you know what i mean the sort of like any country club you want white or like had a relative on the mayflower white or like i cant read but i got into harvard like thats the white you wanna be in beantown and growing up i became so keenly aware of that and i started changing things about myself to appear a little less jewish like when i was a kid no one called me alex everyone called me david or david yosefmy– my full name isnt alex edelman my full name get ready is david yosef shimon ben elazar reuven alexander halevi edelman that is my full namei go– sure i go by alex now and my family has noticed the shift my fathers name is elazar thats the name that he goes by and hes like youre not proud of your real name and im like no and hes like why not and im like i dont know elazar maybe because it sounds like were all in slytherinthats why i have cousins mikal and penecost you cant even spell their names right in english cause theres no english letter for phlegm i dont wanna get into a game of like how jewish are you this is how jewish we are my brother aj or adam yitzhak chaim qualified for the last winter olympics for israel this is not a joke aj– i mean like it is eventually a joke but like this aj qualified for the last winter olympics for israel and whenever i tell people that they always have a few questions theyre like your brother yesyour brother yes your brothers an olympian yeah if youre wondering turns out its nurture your brothers an olympian i know for israel i know the winter olympics i know does israel have winters not really he had to train in munich in what must be the irony to end all ironies whats ajs sport ajs sport is called skeleton which is like which is like luge but headfirst by the way my father says on television that i have to inform audiences that aj is a hero its an accomplishment and were so proud of himthere okay skeleton– oh are you– no no no no no its its the dumbest sport in the world its not a real sport its a lunch tray and an icy hillheres heres how dumb this sport is we went to go see aj qualify upstate lake placid and this guy from italy named cicini named jeanluc cicini he crashed at the top of the run and his little sled went down without him and the sled on its own finished in fourth place and i think about that every day cause my brothers always like its a skill sport and im like its gravity aj a corpse and some duct tape would medal in this event you turn on the olympics and bob costas would be like wow tom look at simmons keeping his shoulders so still in those corners also i had no faith in him no like whenever they interview athlete families ',\n",
       "  'theyre always like we knew im like you knew oh we knew that megan was special and she would lead the womens team to the world– there was none of that in my house i made fun of my brother every day i called him the frozen chosen for like four years in a row and then my mom was like stop calling him that and this is gonna be too jewish for a couple of you but i switched over to shul runnings and i am so proud shul means synagogue in yiddish we had tshirts made its like a whole thing were at were at the olympics were sitting on this bus from the olympic village to the venue and this israeli reporter was interviewing aj and he was like adam what was it like when you found out you were going to be an olympian and aj was like oh guri no one was more surprised than i was and out loud on israeli tv i just went thats not true its not true i bet my daddollars that he wouldnt make the olympicsbut he did he made the olympics hes one of thebest skeleton athletes on the planet out of theskeleton athletes on the planet and he did it for israel and thats a whole separate kettle of fish but we are proudly and emphatically jewish and its a huge part of my background and my upbringing and the filter through which i see the world but but when im standing in this apartment in queens and this guy says whats your name i tell him my names alex cause im not gonna give him the backstoryi said im alex and of course i said how about you man like whats your name and the guy thought about ithe just went my names cortez and i said im sorry your name is cortez and with a real knife in his voice the guy just said we dont give real names to people who are here for the first time and he looked directly into my face and im trying to look back at him like not too aggressive but also not like a coward and its very awkward theres like a real moment of tension but that tension is broken fairly quickly cause this guy just came crossing from the other side of the room and he looked at us and he just went hey matt were starting and i was like nice to meet you cortez and then we start we start there was a moment before i walked in where i was like all right if i get scared i wont i wont try anything fancy i will leave i will excuse myself to the bathroom and just go but nothing scary is happening yet people are just pulling up chairs to the middle of the room and everythings like a little higgledypiggledy but we wind up with like a ragged circle of chairs that doesnt quite close all the way on the end over here its like a semicircle or like an antisemicircleits im over here im over here im over here theres uh there areof us okay im gonna say us im gonna lump myself in logistically seventeen of us twelve men five women including chelsea my new love chelseas like two three seats away from me on this side this side of the circle a little bit younger than this side of the circle but this side of the circle seems to know each other much better a little more engaged a little more hardcore this side of course has cortez my pal hes like um five six seats away from me on this side jigsaw ladys sitting next to him and we start we start and for the firstor so minutes of this meeting these guys talked about the royal wedding meghan and harry it had happened since they last got together and they were upset about it and it took me way longer than it should have to realize why they were upset meghan markles mixed race of course she is i forgot that i forgot you know who didnt forgetwhite nationalists theyre very upset they prefer that he marry a first cousin as per usual uh real quick i have a connection to prince harry which is that my friend jack once did cocaine with him in a london nightclub bathroom all right that did not get the reaction that i wanted from you i will sidebar for this prince harry had a cocaine problem its the best thing we dont talk about it enough as a culture its in the new book its fantastic i dont approve of cocaine but i love that prince harry had a cocaine problem because in america we forget this but in england the queen is on all of the money so that means at some point prince harry rolled up a picture of his grandmother to do drugs that he bought with other pictures of his grandmother that will never happen to any of you none of you can walk into times square after this and the drug dealers like excuse me thatll bedollars and youre like excuse me heres a picture of my grandma at her h jubilee parade hes like what youre like heres a picture of my grandma with winston churchill and hes like howd you get this and youre like heres a picture of my grandma planning the death of my mom it only works for him what are you gonna do about it though huh what are you gonna tell people not to watch the special fuck you what are you gonna do just cause its not in the crown doesnt mean it didnt happen grow the fuck up by the way just so you know cocaine has no effect on menone zero because im part of this generation of overmedicated adhd children do you know what i mean like someone offered me cocaine a couple of years ago and i tried it and they were like how do you feel and i was like like theres homework to do do you feel like dancing were going dancing and im like i cant im putting a bibliography together arent i im gonna get started on the secondary sources you factcheck the primary sources where are you going we needwords on moby dick by thursday anyway theyre upset and this is a huge group of nodders like if anyone ever agreed with anything they were like mmhmm mmhmm and someones like its a disgrace and everyones like its a disgraceits a disgrace and someone else was like it represents the sorry state of the west and everyones like the west what happened to our standards in the west and jigsaw lady jigsaw– im fascinated by this person not much for eye contact always looking at her shoes like they owed her moneyalways straight down but whenever she spoke you knew who was talking no one else had a register like this and at some point she just went didnt just happen though did it didnt just happen is what weve come to this is what weve come to a member of the royal family marrying a– and then she uses the nword and chelsea just said you know im not crazy about that word actually and i thought to myself theres a spectrum of nazi i kept falling in love with chelsea a little bit i did for two reasonsfirst of all you never know second of all– right you never know second of all i love romantic comedy fi',\n",
       "  'lms right you wouldnt watch this what a great meetcute for a romcom no we meet at this meeting shes played by anne hathaway i like to imagine ive booked the role of myself but if were being honest its jesse eisenberg or skinny jonah hill and like we meet at this meeting and we start dating and i have to hide the fact that im jewish and eventually we start sleeping together and shes like why are you circumcised and im like dont worry about it and like things are going really amazing and i get down on one knee towards the end of the film at the top of the empire state building in the rain its a romcom and as i open up my ring box to propose i lock eyes with my talma teacher from fifth grade and im like rabbi klammer and hes like david yosef shimon edelman and shes like and she runs away but her best friend rebel wilson is like girl you gotta go back to him he is a good man and so we reunite and we kiss and the last scene of the movie were married in my parents synagogue right like thats how that would go you know on broadway ive had to explain that to– the stomp to people so like if you guys dont know when jews get married they wrap a glass up in a napkin and then they crush the glass because the glass represents happiness so youre just like bam heres the problem with my romcom i date very assertive women i always have so what would really happen is wed meet at this meeting wed start dating and then three weeks later i would be a nazi id be standing on my parents front lawn in brookline massachusetts holding a brick and shed be like do it and im like hi eema hi mom this is chelsea this is matt– sorry this is cortez theres so much complaining in this room thats the first thing that– theres so much kvetching in this room this is around the time they were taking down confederate statues remember that theyre very upset about that they talked a lot about how white history is being erased theyre taking down statues of white people theyre pulling white people out of textbooks someone over here says they dont even teach about white men in public schools anymoreand everyones like mmhmm mmhmm and white people arent just being replaced in the classroom its happening in real life its happening in real life in their own country in their own country its a disgrace its a disgrace and whats enabling this replacement whats enabling as the guy next to me says the slowmoving genocide against whites in america its this myth its this myth of white privilege and this myth drives so much of the stuff they hate it drives diversity hiring initiatives it drives a popular culture they despise despise and it drives reverse racism which is when people are racist against white people just because theyre white and then someone over here says its the biggest problem in the country today and no one is brave enough to talk about itand everyones like mmhmm mmhmm and i can give you two guesses at who they blame for this kind of thing and you might not need your second guess because running through this meeting is this thick vein of antisemitism but ive never seen this kind of antisemitism before its almost exhilarating its like thick technicolor weaponsgrade conspiracytheory level anti– like at some point this guy two seats away from me he just went jews are sneaky and theyre everywhereand i was like seems like the wrong time to argue with this guy actually thats a disgrace thats a disgrace i see myself very much as a jew obviously but i see myself more than anything else as a jew like when i wake up in the morning my first thought is like jew waking up and not just jewish religious observant thoughtful about what it means in my life if i was very secular id be a completely different human being complete– if i was very secular in a fun liberal city like new york or san francisco i think id consider myself bisexual but because i was raised religious in a place like boston i consider myself straight with a couple of secrets and i remember the first time i was aware of being jewish i should have been aware like eight days inbut the first time i was aware the first time i was aware i was like five years old im at a chuck e cheese at a childrens birthday party in natick massachusetts and i reached for a slice of pizza that had some sausage on it or pepperoni something not kosher and my grandfather was there and he saw me reaching and he kicked my hand kicked and he said you cant have that david were jewish and i said what does that mean and with a totally straight face he just went it means youll never be happy and i said beemet which means for real and he went oh yeah and i said why and he said it means youll never be happy with the way things are and youll always question things and even when things are pretty good they wont seem that good to you and i said papa i dont wanna be jewish and then my grandfather laughed at me and he just went sweetie thats the most jewish thing there is and it blows my mind when i meet nonjews and they say things to me like oh well i get it cause i used to be a christian so sorry what well i was raised christian but a couple years ago i decided i was nothing sono– i understand that intellectually i respect that of course but that is not how it works in judaism you cant leave when you feel like it judaism is the hotel california of religions it is a mailing list you can never unsubscribe from and i worry that im not jewish enough i worry that i– which is crazy cause to my comedy friends im the most jewish person theyve ever met im a beard away from their conception of rabbi and to my family im lady gaga i called my father once my father is this lovely thoughtful professor at harvard medical school religious wears a yarmulke a kippah every single day of his life if something goes well he says baruch hashem thank god and i called him i said dad abba i worry that the life that i lead isnt jewish enough and he said alex i understand that concern and i said do you ever worry about that and he said of course i worry every day that the life that you lead isnt jewish enough and i am so tough on other jews i am relentless with other jews its my least favorite thing about myself like like i was at a friends house im meeting my friends baby so many of my friends are having babies or adopting im thinking a lot about adoption but imand i think for adoption thats right on the line agewise right like i think thats too old i dont think anyone is gonna take me at this pointbut like— im ho',\n",
       "  'lding im holding this baby and the baby starts to cry oh babys name is yasi my friends name is mati his wifes name is rahelthese are normal names where im from they are those are normal names and im holding the baby and he starts to cry which is fine hes a baby but rahel who i dont thinks ever really liked me just went huh looks like hes not a fan of yours is he and i said its fine hes a baby and she said he actually has a really good sense for men and i said he doesnt have a good sense for anything he doesnt even know hes alive yet and apparently never say this to a new mother i said hes just like a brisket with eyes right now and she said hes very intuitive and i said hes not he shits himself and the husband who ive known forever hes seen enough and he just went whoa whoa– still calls me david thats how long ive known this guy ive known this guy forever and he went whoa sorry david were a little uptight– we are were a little uptight cause people have been judging us for the way that were raising the baby and i said what do you mean and he said well weve decide– weve decided that were not gonna vaccinate until we know a bit more and i was like against covid you dont need to hes an infant hes like not against covid against like mumps and measles and the other stuffand i was like oh oh well first of all heres your disease baby back second of all what are you talking about and he said well weve read that the vaccines can cause autism and i said that is not true and rahel went what do you know about autism and i was like first of all ive been testedtimes you think you get like this without people asking a couple of questions i am so neurodivergent i saw so many child psychiatrists growing up in the greater boston area the last one was free and i just have like one memory im sitting on this brown couch in this doctors office and my mom is outside in the waiting room talking to the doctor and i just remember hearing her go what do you mean hes fine and i was like yeah vaccines dont cause autism mati you know that and like it ends the conversation he just went well its our opinion isnt it were his parents its our opinion and i dont know that i would do this with someone who wasnt jewish but i just went oh and you guys are embarrassed right youre mortified cause its such a lowinformation opinion cause theres no basis in science and its so bad for the child so you probably dont tell people something so illinformed and he said excuse me were his parents you dont have children youve never had to make this choice youre judging us for our opinion and i was like thats how we judge people their opinions and their actions and the content of their character it used to be skin color but someone had a dream and he said to me in hebrew in hebrew david you cant judge us only god only hashem can judgeand that worked with me no but that calmed me down immediately cause it reminded me how i know this guy i know this guy cause we went to a yeshiva together which is a hebrew day school and in a yeshiva you study torah every morning fromam topm because yeshiva is a hebrew word that means miserable in a yeshiva when they teach you about god they teach you that he acts through you if you are kind that is god showing kindness if youre empathetic that is hashem manifesting empathy in hebrew the word is kli it means vessel you are a vessel for gods action and so he said to me david you cant judge us only god can judge us alex cant judge us only hashem only hashem can judge i calmed myself down and i remembered that we have this common language and lineage and that on paper were basically the same person and i explained to him that its possible that god was judging him but that i was the vessel through which he had chosen to judge him and we have not been invited back to that house but its worth asking why this guy and his wife who i have everything in common with thats who i go toetotoe with in their own living room i show them so little understanding in this living room in queens where i have so little in common with anyone i sat there listening to them for an hour all right guys i sat in a conversation without talking one time for an hour which for me unprecedented i couldnt even nod everybody else was like mmhmm mmhmm i had to nod at things out of context like at some point someone was like what it means to be a man in the workplace is changing and i was like thats absolutely– yeah theres a reckoning going on i agree with that its way better now you cant just like throw your interns out the windows mmhmm and someones like billionaires and corporations control our elections and i was like id like to see meaningful campaign finance reform in the united states such a progressive value isnt it yeah thats good and finally i get a chance to talk theres this guy two seats away from chelsea and his name is witt and if such a thing can be said hes my favorite you know how some people can be in their early thirties but they have a vibe of teenager thats witt hes a little blithe and slumpy and at some point hes like you know whats really hard for us now its really hard for us to reach new people on social media and i said do you know why that is and chelsea went alex do you know something about social media and i said chelsea i know a lot about social media and i started explaining this thing called the meaningful content algorithm this is so interesting all right it used to be in the early days of social media when you logged in youd see stuff chronologically remember that youd see things based on when they were posted but now when you log in you dont see that anymore you see what the algorithm thinks youll enjoy most first thats because of this thing called the meaningful content algorithm and its balkanized us into these social media echo chambers which has made it so hard for new ideas or in this like one specific instance the oldest ideas in the world to reach new people and so i start explaining the algorithm i start explaining social media echo chambers i start explaining cambridge analytica the company thats like best at this and everybodys listening to me and at some point i looked around the circle and people have got their arms crossed and theyre nodding at each other and theyre nodding at me and i thought to myself all at once oh im positively contributing to this meeting of white nationalists i came as an observer im gonna leave as like the youth outreach officer or something but there',\n",
       "  ' was a moment where i actually started to feel very badly for these people i dont want to be gratuitous but these are not lifes winners hashem has not given with both hands to anyone in this room they are not the brightest they are not the wealthiest they are very badly informed and most importantly these guys are racists in new york city theyre racists in queens the most diverse borough and the most– guys its queens in queens you cant even getnazis together without a jew being sat right there in the middle of you this isnt arkanssippi are you kidding me were two blocks away from little ethiopia things are going not well for these people and at some point i had a thought which was so like i had a thought that was so selfaggrandizing it took me two years to tell anyone about it but at some point i looked around the circle and i thought to myself wow look at me empathizing look at me feeling bad for these people when theyre so horrible but im such a good boy am i the hero that we need in these difficult and divided times and then i thought do i have a duty as a jew to hear these people cause theres actually something to that if you raise jewish children correctly empathy is the default empathy is the true north for every jewish value and all of the best jewish moments of my life are moments where those values showed up in places you would never look for them like once when i was a kid my family had christmas this is totally true my mom had this friend named kate and over the course of a calendar year kate lost her last parent and her last sibling she had nowhere to go for the holiday my mom said kate why dont you come to our house well do christmas thats the kind of person my mom ismy father did not want that mom is a jew from cincinnati shes a midwestern jewits a slightly gentler existence my father grew up jewish in boston like me but in a time when it was so hard to be jewish there which is between the yearsandand he said cheryl i will not have christmas in a jewish home and my mom was like elazar were having christmas and hes like over my dead body are we having christmas so they compromised and we had christmasso yeah obviously obviously aj and i come downstairs one day my parents are sitting in the living room i dont know if any of you grew up in a home like this we were never allowed in our living room never the living room is for guests and tragedies those are the only times and every piece of furniture is covered in plastic in case the real owners of the house show up one day we come downstairs no guests aj and i look at each other like oh no bubbe died again and we sit down on the couch and my mom just said boys this year were having christmas and aj and i were so young and insulated we looked at each other and we looked at my dad and i just went okay whats christmas and my father said its like hanukkah and my mom undermined him immediately and went yeah but maybe even a little bit more fun hanukkah sucks by the way hanukkah– i appreciate the politically correct world that everybody lives in where we all pretend that all the holidays are equal they are not equal every– hanukkahs very much the diet coke to christmas black tar heroin there is no comparison no– go into a supermarket come december christmas is everywhere hanukkahs one little nub at the end of the shampoo aisle theres passover matzah in there for some reason and nonjews are gorgeous cause theyre always like well youre so lucky you get eight days of gifts i have never met a single jew who got eight days of decent gifts heres how it works you get one gift over the course of the– like if youre getting a bike you get like a pedal on the first day handlebars on the second then the wheelit is absolute bullshit anyway we do christmas and oh my god do we do christmas we do the lights we do the christmas dinner my my mom put up stockings above the fireplace with our names on them in hebrew and we we went whole hog no hog kosher christmas but we decked these halls deck and kate comes into our house and kate white princess diana haircut chunky gold earrings hermès scarf shocking blue pantsuit white but she walks into our house like a little kid just like and she starts to cry immediately and my mom said boys whatever she wants to do were gonna do and we did all this deep cuts christmas stuff we strung popcorn together on a string we ate our way through an entire chocolate advent calendar in likeminutes and we watched christmas movies please try to imagine being a young jew and youve never heard of christmas and then on the day you find out about it you watch like seven christmas movies in a row aj and i are like oh so this holidays a huge deal huh and the one that sticks out is the peanuts christmas special snoopy charlie brown best thing weve ever seen aj and i are like vibrating an inch from the tv ajs like the meaning of christmas snoopy and im like the spirit of christmas charlie brown my dads in the corner like praying for lightninglike and at some point a character on the screen just went linus we need to put out cookies for santa claus dont we and aj and i look at each other and we look at my dad and i just went abba whos santa claus and my father says this didnt happen and it is the single clearest memory from my childhood my father rarely cursed in front of us and maybe he thought we couldnt hear him but he looked at my mom and he just went cheryl jesus fucking christ and my mom said elazar and he said come on and she went just do it this is a direct quote this is a direct quote from like twentyfive years ago my father walked up to us and he said santa claus boys he is a fat man but its a good fatbut its a good– you know like santas an avocado or something but its a good fat and he comes down nonjewish chimneys in the middle of the night and he gives gifts to young christians and aj and i are like and aj just said and hes coming here my fathers like sure i guess hes coming here we put out cookies for santa claus were very skeptical obviously we go upstairs we go to bed we come downstairs the next morning the cookies are gone guys theyre gone and aj and i see that and we lose consciousness immediately we like black out and i know its happened cause theres home video and on the home video were going crazy were like oh my god oh my god he was here he was here eema he was here dad he was here and at some point ajs standing on the couch and he looked at me and he just went santa came and i went ba',\n",
       "  'ruch hashem and we ran out to the garage why because this is the one concession my father got from my mom hes like cheryl i will not have a christmas tree in a jewish home and my mother was like i can respect that elazar well put it in the garage and there are two photos of this weird photos were wearing pajamas cause were children but were wearing jackets cause were in a boston garage in december and were wearing yarmulkes cause were jews but were standing in front of a fullydecorated christmas tree with a teddy bear wearing his own yarmulke on top of it and weve got headphones on why because this is how long ago it was we got cassette tape walkmen remember the square dealies we were thrilled that was santas gift kate had gotten us her own gift kate had pulled my parents aside the night before and she was like dont worry cheryl dont worry elaser i got your boys jewish gifts my father was like oh okay um kate when you say jewish gifts what do you mean and kates like i got them gifts from the torah this was kates gift from the torah to put in our cassette tape walkmen kate got us on cassette the cast recording of andrew lloydwebbers joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat where the role of joseph was sung by– anybody know donny osmonddonny osmond thank you donny osmond two photos weird photos pajamas jackets yarmulkes christmas teddy bear yarmulke headphones and on the headphones an old testament story from the torah adapted into a musical by a british aristocrat where the lead role sung by a mormonits very interfaith and we go to school that day because yeshiva hebrew day school not canceled for christmas and we come home that night and my father gets a phone call its exactly what you think and the first thing the principal says to him is professor edelman your sons have a lying problem my father said what did they do and the principal said well the teacher tried to explain to the children the very delicate topic of christmas and alex raised his hand and just went we had christmas and the teachers like you didnt have christmas and i was like hmm pretty sure we had christmas lights stockings snoopy charlie brown meaning of christmas spirit of christmas pretty sure we had christmas and the teachers like you didnt have christmas you had hanukkah three weeks ago or four months from now depending on the jewish calendar yearanyway nonjews believe in this guy called santa claus and in my minds eye i see aj raising his hand and saying we had santa claus and im wrong the teacher came to the show im wrong about two things first of all apparently aj didnt raise his hand apparently aj lifted two fingers in the words of the teacher like he was ordering his second martini and aj didnt say we had santa claus apparently aj just went we know santa claus and the teachers like you dont know santa claus and ajs like hmm but we do know santa claus and the other kids are like whos santa claus and ajs like oh hes amazing hes a fat man but its a good kind of fat and he comes down nonjewish chimneys in middle of the night and he gives gifts to young christians but but last night because hes friends with our dad he came to our house and he left this walkman underneath the tree that my parents put in the garage and he ate all of the cookies and the principal said professor edelman is this true and apparently my father just went noit its not entirely true and rabbi falk said what do you mean its not entirely true then my father said cheryl and i ate the cookies santa claus didnt come to our house and my mom says there was a significant pause on the other end of the phone and then the principal said im aware santa claus didnt come to your house you had christmas and my father explained my father explained that this woman was bereft she had nowhere to go and he had reservations about it but he let it happen because he thought it was such a valuable teachable moment right where he could show his children that doing the thing centered in jewish values the good deed may not always appear conventionally jewish principal says professor edelman i understand where youre coming from but youre wrong cause what youve actually done is youve introduced this holiday that is foreign and corrosive into your home and youve clearly confused your children and perhaps harmed them permanently when youve given them this holiday next year are you gonna take it away will you keep celebrating what are you gonna do and more than anything else this isnt a good deed its idol worship its the most serious sin a jew can commit and you and your wife need to begin atoning for it right now and my father to his credit said well clearly rabbi you dont understand the meaning of christmas and then he hung up the phone and look i love that story i think it reflects so well on my parents but theres such a good question at the center of it very jewish one actually which is like to what do our empathies extend is it unconditional does it matter who they are does it matter how they feel about us does it matter why were empath– does it matter why were empathizing cause for a while i was empathizing in this room these people feel powerless they feel voiceless even if they arepercent wrong those are universal struggles its hard to hate people up close but once i realized i was empathizing i was like look at me by the way not just empathizingconnecting once i started talking i was in the flow of conversation so effortlessly i thought to myself im gonna be a grand wizard in like two weeks at this rate im getting my hood tonight like its happening i keep making eye contact with chelsea thats going amazing but like— but now my fantasys not just chelsea anymore now it sort of flowered out to the rest of the room like obviously everybody heres gonna be a table at the wedding but like besides that im– no im gonna fix these people guys me im gonna fix them by the time this meeting starts to wind down my good guy fantasies are like a runaway train i have spoken more than twothirds of the people in this room i am in they like me and theres this guy sitting almost directly across from me right where the circle gaps and hes sort of running the meeting and at some point he was like all right guys were gonna take a break anyone who wants to get a pastry can get a pastry when we come back well talk next steps and im nodding at this point im like mmhmm mmhmm next steps and cortez whose eyes have very rarely left my area just went hold on one– b',\n",
       "  'rian excuse me hold on one second and he said alex and i said mmhmm and he said where are you from and i said im from boston and he said cool how long have you lived in new york city and i said oh ive been here about nine years and he went great whats the ethnic origin of your grandparents and there was a little voice in the back of my head that just went wow that third question was so different from the first two questions and i was like well my fathers family is from poland but my mothers family is also from poland actually and the guy starts peppering me with questions one after the– he asks me where in new york city i live he asks me if i live alone he asks me how much money i make in a year and at some point i got a little offended and i was just like this guys got a problem hes obsessed with me everyone else in this room they like me its so weird that theyre not stopping him its weird that he can read that and hes like where did you go to college and i was like i went to new york university he said what did you study and i said english literature he said where did you go to high school and i said i went to a school in boston called maimonides and he went maimonides and i said its a yeshiva oh and halfway around the circle this lady just went oh boy and witt went whats a yeshiva and i said its like a hebrew day school and chelsea looking for any sort of out at this point i assume just went your parents made you go to a hebrew day school and i said kind of and she said why and jigsaw lady of course not looking at me of course just went chelsea so very clearly a jew and because it wasnt that big a deal i just went i mean yeah yeah im im jewish you know people say that political correctness is a big part of our culture but maybe its great because i think political correctness is the reason that after i said i was jewish there was a split second where everyone in the circle kind of looked at each other with a real energy of like are we cool with that now did i miss an email or something i dont wanna be rude but isnt that like one of our big things and then one person starts to talk and then another and then and then i realized i may have misread how welcome i am and people are yelling but no ones yelling at me theyre yelling at the guy running the meeting and i felt a little bad for him i was like theyre not gonna get to the next steps for a while probablyand cortez this guys out of his seat like hes won a basketball game hes like i told you i fucking– so obvious look at him and i look at chelsea and as soon as i do i regret it she has such an expression on her face she looks so aggrieved she has an expression like a shattered and reglued plate she looks so upset and i find it so hard to look at her after that and this guy running the meeting calms everybody down no small feat hes like okay okay no i didnt know and he said alex and i said mmhmm and he said why are you here which in retrospect is an excellent question and this is my favorite detail from the whole meeting this is my favorite detail from the whole night he said why are you here and i said oh i saw this tweet that said if you have questions about your whiteness then come– before i can finish witt almost brightly just went oh thats my tweet oh thats my tweet with a real energy of like see we are reaching some new people on social media and even then i was like yeah bud i saw your tweet and as a white man i actually– and i dont get to finish that sentence everyone starts yelling except for– no youre not white youre jewish youre semitic its different someone over here went hes not even a real jew and i was like dad and he said hes an impostor from the khazars and i said oh i– okay well i dont know where that is but i am jewish and i am white and everyone says youre not and i thought this would help me i really did i went guys guys i know its complicated given given that whiteness is largely a social construct but i actually benefit an enormous amount from white privilege and everyones like no no are you kidding havent you been listening white privilege isnt real white privilege is bullshit someone over here just went you have jewish privilege its different i was like thats so interesting i never thought about that before but actually i benefit a great deal from my whiteness and cortez is incensed hes out of his seat hes like it doesnt exist and i said come on man and he went really and i said i benefit from it he went when was the last time you got something for being white and i said matt i got a free muffin for it like an hour ago i i dont wanna spoil the ending of this for you but chelsea and i were not gonna work out although itd be so cool if i could say and here she is come on out sweetie and shes like ah i actually started dating someone i actually started dating someone a couple months after this and when i told her about this night the first thing she said to me she said just so you know this is the epitome of white privilege and i said what do you mean and she said nothing says white privilege more than a jew walking into a meeting of racists and thinking thisll probably be fine things usually work out pretty good for me honestly oh look muffins those are for me ill be out there afterwards by the way if anyone wants to ask a question i answer every question but obviously if youre watching at home and you have a question im obscenely easy to reach on social media even if you hated the show tweet at me theres a list i can add you to you know and the two questions i get the most are one were you scared not really heres the thing nazis hmm far less intimidating than the way that my grandfather described them also theyre not nazis but– i hate to clarify a joke but being a nazi is actually such a specific thing from an extremely specific moment in history these guys wish they were nazis like you ever see kids in the park and theyre hitting each other with tinfoil swords these guys are nazis the way that those guys are the knights of the round table these are nerf nazis you know and the second question i get asked every single day is whyd you go did you really go my wife and i cant believe you whyd you go thought i could make it work its my job i make it work i get on stage every night and i am pandering and solicitous and i hope that its enough to make people enjoy the show or tell a friend please tell a friend and its gross and theres a huge part of me that genuinely walked into this room think',\n",
       "  'ing like theyre just antisemites cause they havent met alex yet havent met david yosef shimon ben elazar reuven this not that different from the meeting not for me im only telling you stuff i think youd enjoy right like if you really knew me you might not like me right thered be a political opinion you couldnt stand or id be too something id be too pretentious or ambitious or lazy or too jewish or not jewish enough thered be something you know who i think about constantly robin williams a gift for connection no one else could– a gorilla a gorilla was like oh my god the talent is undeniablea gorilla if robin williams can make it work with a gorilla i should be okay withwhite people in queens trying to acknowledge their humanity with this analogy but i am aware that in this analogy these guys are gorillas and im one of the greatest comics whos ever lived but if you think about it who gets dehumanized right cause for a second im in im white finally right childhood dream achieved and then they find out that im jewish and the walls go up but it doesnt reflect amazing on me cause i wanted them to like me i was performing i am always perform– i got kicked out of this meeting and it bothers me on a craft level cause thats what happens this guy calms everybody down and hes like okay okay were gonna take that break and anyone who needs to leave can leave and even though im not amazing with social cues i was like i bet he means me and this is the kind of dumb joke the whole show could have been everybody else gets up and they all move to the far right corner of the room and im getting my stuff i look sad now i look like ive lost wimbledon or somethingim like oh god cant believe they would do this to the good boy and chelsea chelsea chelsea crosses this vast expanse of floor to me and i felt so bad for her in that– i remember thinking man horrible time and place for you to discover that this is your type and she gets to me she said youre jewish and i said can you believe it and for the first time it doesnt work and she went so youre fully semitic or partial whats going on and i said both my parents are jewish and she said thats so interesting shes very calm actually thats so interesting you know why because this is a private residence and i said well i was invited and she said you were you werent invited youre committing a crime right now youre trespassing you cant be here this is just for us go so so the next morning call david burstein tell him what he missed and hes quiet all the way through he just lets me talk i talk for likeminutes but when i got to this part of the story he interrupted me and pardon the language but he was like and you looked at her and you said fuck you lady and then you looked at everybody else in the room and youre like fuck every single one of you racist bigoted antisemitic assholes and i was like yeah of course i put a finger in her face and im like screw you and screw– screw all your little nazi budd– but thats not what happened what really happened is i got scared by the trespassing thing and i quailed immediately and i just went okay and on the way out this is so much worse i looked at everybody else and i just went sorry you guys and i left i left you know i had a conversation with someone the day before this run on broadway started and and he said to me would you go back a thousand percent and he said really i said yeah what im supposed to lock myself in a room with people who agree with me thats how you wind up like this but i get his point because whenever anyone is like oh the way to reach these people on the far right or the far left is to extend this hand of brotherhood and connection and let them know that in the marketplace of ideas they are welcome– like thats a lovely notion thats how i feel thats a jewish value but some of them want us gone and when i say us i mean us like even if you guys arent jewish or a person of color the fact that you bought a ticket to this show i feel bad for you guys you guys are screwed see you on the trains they hate you so much im glad i went i really took something away with me not like a lesson or anything like that i really took something away with me and its very small but i think its significant and i think its significant because its one piece from a iece jigsaw puzzle section by the polyphonic spree playingand i know

writing the book right hey could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages theyre not gonna do that thats the vatican theyre their own city they got a wall around their own city theyre brushing off cases of pedophilia like its nothing theyre not taking that call oh what happened really go fuck yourself click they dont carei learned a long time ago i think whatever youre into youre into but im not into that religious stuff where– and this is why i actually walked away from my religion i had to be honest with myself one i didnt like to go– i didnt like going to church every week you know i just didnt part of it was im lazy i dont like getting up on sundays and the other part was i already heard all the stories okay heard them three four times the dude hasnt come back yet you know were just sort of mulching over the same shit here i got it – right –and the other aspect was you know i actually– i had to be honest with myself i felt my religion made sense and everybody elses sounded stupidi did look im not talking about the basis of every religion basis of every religion makes sense you know the ten commandments dont kill anybody dont touch my wife thats my bike right that all makes sense of which ive broken i think ive broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one thats it i havent killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and theyre wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh shh shh right see the whole thing so well see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where were going and what happens after we die everybody elses religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles theres a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my lifeyeah like your guys name is ron ron and he wasnt alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like years ago he had a drivers license social security number theres like footage of him stubbing his toe motherfucker right i know what happened he was working at dennys he got sick of it ill start a religion hey everybody theres this spaceship coming back everybodys getting sneakers this is tom cruise were gonna try to make you clear right look im paraphrasing im paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but thats essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so yeah that made total sense to me so it',\n",
       "  ' just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesnt you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we– right we got the space shuttle you know theres sneakers theres a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think its cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldnt there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right ah son there is no fat fuck its your mother and i your moms the tooth fairy rabbits dont have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams wont come true right and i was just like wow this is how the world is and meanwhile this shit was just floating this ound gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person thats very offensive to me and other christians and become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just yeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i dont go anymore or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let gojust let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think hes along for the ride the two of them theyre a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking that rock just keeps going this dude just stops thats what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didnt read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it and on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures i just floated awayso now its like im in this weird place where im not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you knowid like to believe in something so ive been going around asking people what their shit is and i havent been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there theyre like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die youre dead and thats it dead like a pigeon just– just layin there over blew my mind im like really youre just dead like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged right god pops in the dvd of your life well i dont know about this right here mind explaining yourself this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night but i actually resent the fact that im gonna get judged someday like if thats true that somebodys gonna judge me that doesnt even make any sense its like dude you made me so this is your fuckup all right lets not try to turn this around on me you know jesus christ you give me freedom of choice you make whores you have me suck at math and you dont think this things gonna go off the rails like you set me up to fail and now you got the balls to now question your own goddamn work dude if i made a car if i built a car and it didnt run i wouldnt burn it forever you evil piece of shit just light it on fire i wouldnt i would troubleshoot is there gas in the engine is the battery charged anything beyond this i got to get a real man to look at it but i believe in you im gonna try and help you out yes my religion its nuts its fucking nuts like my religion like the way i was brought up is like you know you can make it to heaven but like some of your family members possibly couldnt or some of your friends doesnt even make sense like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if thats the deal right just sitting here waiting for my friends to show up jesus christ where the hell are they its been likeyears they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit doing some yoga right and then one day it just settles in that they didnt make it and then what im still gonna enjoy heaven right jesus coming walking over hey how is it going everybody isnt this great isnt this great yeah dude itd be even better if all my family members and friends werent burning for fucking ever kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there jstar what do you think hey dude i didnt ask you to come over you came walking over with your big dumb sandals hey hey how is it going over here why did you come over here i dont give a damn dude tell your dad i dont give a fuck im already in here im already in here what are you gonna kick me out afterwards go fuck yourself i knew he was gonna be like that i knew it the bosss son is the worst fucking sense of entitlement so yeah so they believe when you die youre dead and i was like so youre just dead like how do you wrap your head around not existing i couldnt get my head around it he goes well like before when you were born do you remember that and i was like no and the guys like yeah its just like that im like not only does that make sense that is absolutely terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared im getting as i get older im developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it its not straightacrosstheboard flying i dont like small planes all of a sudden i just dont like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just dont believe in the pilots cause you know what i dont think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like all right well give you likepeople see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring anotherback well let you do this for a while you do this for a while we dont get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit well move you up topeople and then one day youll be in a jet– whoo were going a li',\n",

bunch of people whining in the back my headphones dont work he doesnt give a fuck right hes up there sleeping hes trying to make something happen hes so goddamn bored thats a stud up there right so one time im flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so im on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulenceand it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously likeall of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the planes made of like all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises whoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa im not gonna lie i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life dude that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child but turn around and see a earold mustachioed male going whoo whaaa whoa dude the hair was standing up on my arms im praying to a higher power i dont even believe in the shit i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like dude would you shut the fuck up jesus christ be a man push it down push it down deny your feelings act like you have answers do some man shit right now do some man shit jesus christ you know you think im not up here thinking whaaa whoa i am but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house you know what kills me what absolutely kills me is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy marry him and make half whooo whaaaa fucking kids and you know what we become weaker as a species we dodo you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals now they build cars but it used to be about animals right now its all car stuff looking forward to getting that carburetor today the carburetor didnt fit what do you mean the carburetor doesnt fit dads gonna be madtheres never enough time to build the car its so fucking stupid we got to have this bus done by thursday or else what the guy doesnt want it anymore all right youll get the thing when we finish it okay this is a safety issue you want brakes on it then go get yourself some fucking lunch so beforebefore there used to just be animals and this is what i noticed everything from a lion all the way down to an insect okay if you had one drop of whoo whaaa bitchy blood in you none of the females would fuck you that was it your life was over your life was over no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eightday ant life cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew and the female ant saw it theyre like all right stay away from that one stay away from that one hes gonna jeopardize the whole hill and stacy listen to me human beings have empathy some woman will fall in love well hes nice he wears a sweater he likes to bake you know he lets me finish my stories which is all great qualities okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that youre rolling the dice youre rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house this is the dude who has your back whos gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door and youre gonna turn around all youre gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window i dont know man thats risky you know in reality im being too hard on that guy yeah i am i am cause i was just as scared as he was except i didnt scream out like he did and thats simple the simple reason was this dude he was hugged too much as a child having people going how was your day whats wrong and all of that shit you know thats why i came down here i came out here to tell you guys you got to stop hugging your children you are ruining this country now you can hug your daughters you got to do that you got to do that hug those hooker shoes right out of them let them know that youre a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug them a little bit but every three four you got to fucking knock em down right come on it didnt hurt get up i didnt come from a family i dont know about you guys i didnt come from a touchyfeely call me when you get there mwah mwah none of that shit first time my mom hugged me i think was like once when i was little and when i moved out that was it and we only hugged cause we knew we were supposed to so we just tried to like it was like two parking meters came to life like we almost bumped heads it was horrific fucking horrific to this day sometimes i drive down the street and i think about that hug and its just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head ill just be driving down the street just be like aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head theres something about me like all my regret comes up when im in the shower i dont know what it is i think cause im in the shower and i have time to think and ill just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and ill just be in the shower just being likeand my wifes always just like is everything okay in there ill just be like yeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much every day so yeah i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her how come we never did the hugging thing how come we didnt do that stuff she was like i wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay and i was like you were afraid and she goes well it was your father thats what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you dont know how to raise boys and if you hug them thats whats gonna happen so in a marriage theres compromises yeah so she basically never hugged us cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad di',\n",
       "  'd for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle– sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal im gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i dont have any kids as far as id think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didnt work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesnt talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like dont change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler so he took it from that and knocked it down to dont hug him its gonna make him gay right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid ill whittle it down to like hes not taking drama class all right hes not taking drama class cause i said so lady let me handle this i wont fix everything and thats not a homophobic thing either that i wouldnt send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isnt i would send id let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son cant fucking do any of that shit unless im sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybodys doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybodys likecottage cheese what is it made ofthen he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but theres no way im letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals hes gonna get the shit kicked out of him hes gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like theres some sort of tomfoolery going on around here i dont want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know hes down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific you ever do that again im gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog all rightover so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married thats the big thing yes i did very happy about that im very happy because it was starting to get weird its likeyears old my girlfriend yeah were gonna go out and get some pop going to parties it was just weird cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldnt contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis its just its an advanced learning program the deadline is may h we have to stop the bullying with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old id just be like did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cats food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didnt care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didnt know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands so now im married so the next move is youre supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but imyears old im just thinking its too fucking late ya know come on man im gonna have a kid im gonna die of natural causes when the kids in fifth grade throwing him a frisbee we used to use these on a saturday do a face plant my kids standing there mom dads sleeping again i feel hopelessly behind all my friends have kids most of my friends who have kids are cool but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid that i dont understand anything anymore you know those people the most basic shit hey man its kind of cold out today dude you dont understand you dont understand cold till you got a twoyearold with a mitten up his ass and youre trying to get chocolate off the other ones face all right all right i get it you have a more complex life but i still understand being cold teeth chattering kind of lets me know right mine just turned six mine just turned seven i just feel hopelessly behind so what im actually thinking of doing im thinking about adopting yeah absolutely recycle you know think globally act locally everything doesnt have to be brandnew you know its like when you redo your kitchen you got custom up top you got ikea down the bottom right id love to adopt its a great thing to do but if i do it im not telling any of my friends im just gonna show up with the kid one day just to piss em off mine just turned six mine just turned seven id love to just show up with an eightyearold like dominoes yeah now i get to tell you what you dont understand sevenyearold wait till they turn eight eight is such a funny age terrible twos try the instant eights bam theyre just there like with all their issues i should do it though i should adopt i think its a great thing to do and i already know what i want to get i do i want to get like an always garaged good dentition do you know what i would love to do id love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop wouldnt that be amazing like find the kid that made this shirt just show up at the factory like hey come on bring it in bring it in you little maniac how you doing youre going back to the states lshaped couch flat screen tv get in the car the rest of you keep sewing but you youre coming home with ',\n",
       "  'me yeah dude how easy how easy would that kid be to raise after the hell hes been through all i gotta do is let him sit down i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met just bring him home have a seat hell be like i get to sit down yeah lay down on the couch hell be like its like a cloud its like a cloud ill get him a bowl of fritos put on cricket or soccer one of those sweatshop sports i dont know the kid would love me so thats my first draft pick all right coming out of the gate with that in the second round id probably get like anboy soldier ya know yeah shore up the offensive line you gotta protect the blindside thats how fucked up the world is theres little boys out there fighting in wars so thats a twofer i can drag him out of that hell give him something of whats left of his childhood and god forbid if the dollar ever collapses right shit goes south zombies take over i got backup everybody thinks im gonna be the problem meanwhile i got this sawedoff chuck norris standing next to mekills confirmed fucking kills theyre not stories can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster you cant coach that right i got to be honest with you i feel like id have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider i might be nuts but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid right i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room im getting sick of this shit goes for you too if you want but you youve been out of line all day mister dont even start that shit dont even start that shit you say that every time yes you do every fucking time you say that you know the answer you want me to say it again ill break it down to you you know why it is you want to know why cause you sew all right yeah you sew dude hes fucking killed people do you understand that no he doesnt he doesnt have to make his bed too no he doesnt because he doesnt sleep in the bed hes out in the bushes all night talking to himself freaking

youre right stop crying stop crying shouldnt have yelled at you i just thought i could fucking bring him in give him a couple of pop tarts i figured hed chill out fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows doing that full metal jacket shit no you cant give him back it doesnt work that way there he is there he is whats up buddy whats going on we were just talking about you just doing like a little surprise thing you feeling all right you feeling all right youre not looking through those eyebrows huh everything okay so i figure uh i dont know if ill do it maybe im too selfish i have no idea im all over the fuckin map do you know what i want to do right now i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter man i do thats my latest thing you know why it is its cause i live in los angeles yeah and its an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning theres not even zoning laws theyll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then theres like a fucking daycare center right the city doesnt even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta youre all right i dont know maybe in atlanta might be crazy youre on the outskirts youre fine youre fine you dont live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath youre cool drink that water for a gooddays la theres nowhere to go thats why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate fuck this im out vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street fuck this this looks safe you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter shes just like yeah no which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like oh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so there goes that hey what other dreams arent i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask yeah im still gonna do it im just not gonna tell her im just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license im not going to tell her im just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room shes just gonna be like what is that what is that for what does that mean yeah someday youll see someday youll see when the shit hits the fan and youre freaking the fuck out and im taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter what is that shut the fuck up and get in now you guys think im bullshitting im not im serious imin on this and ever since i got into it im seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them doing key bumps and shit theyre after me swear to god im seeing stories about them its just like that old advertising anecdote i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden theyre all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away its the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours foryears–years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream i built it up foryears here you go son make the family and the family name proud all right dad i love you all right this poor kid five days in hes supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but hes like i need the money i gotta give him a tour right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped ou',\n",
       "  't yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake we love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft thats orange county theres overmiles of beaches there put your seatbelt back onmiles of beaches was established as a county insir please dont open the door sir what are you doing sir no no dont dont stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck air traffic control i dont know whos on this frequency but you really need– somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he wasyears old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldnt figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didnt go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man take me up in a chopper im looking at the land i love and then im jumping out like a superhero i loved it yeahthis guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i cant imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like fuck you disease i decide ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer take me up in the chopper he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard hes not even listening to this guy giving the tour right overmiles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county insir please dont try to open the door no no dont dont dont incredible but heres the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the oceanfeet up youd think that would be enough so im thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic oot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didnt change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for him on the way down hes got to be thinking three more seconds of pain two more seconds whamoh my god this is worse this is way worse it has a happy ending though he later died at the hospital thats right so heres to him god bless him i hope i have the balls someday so where do you go from there well as i mentioned last time i came through town i wanted to get a gun you know i do yeah but ive finally given up on that i gave up on that dream my wife doesnt want me to get one so yeah she didnt want– dude you got to pick your fucking battles im gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly i cant fucking have somehanging around ill do whatever i want all right what i say goes eat it cant be that person now it fucking bums me out cause all i wanted to do was just

       "  'ople i am having a good time here thats what you do you just do that enough then when you bark back you got a little something heres an olive branch ive extended to her its basically we fight a lot over television ive kind of come her way shes come my way she watches a little bit of sports i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which i dont care the nerds gonna fuck the cheerleader ill watch it right i dont mind them its an uplifting story i just dont like the love scenes in romantic comedies they creep me out theyre just so fucking nice its like missionarystyle theres candles that stupid saxophone musicit always goes down like the saxophone implies the penetration right cause they cant show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the otherof her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a womans sexuality thats never brought up that whole hold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i dont even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didnt even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didnt know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like what are you doing she says like i dont know i just kinda like ya know its like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why dont you want to do it itll be fun why dont i want to do it i dont think i want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck having the cops show up yeah shes in here officer damndest thing it was her idea i swear to god it was her idea yeah they always make it nice in those movies the raciest thing theyll do is every once in a while theyll kiss up against a wall i guess women like walls i didnt know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing oh my god its the wall oh my god its supporting me maybe hell support me its a metaphor i love it yeah i saw one the other night they were doing that and then out of nowhere they started having sex up against the wall im like finally something a little bit more interesting right but they were doing it standing up facing each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult positions there is and they were doing it with little to no difficulty all she did was lift her leg up like that and that was it he was off to the races i ruined the movie for my wife im like that is fucking bullshit bullshit what does the guy have like a ushaped dick how is he doing anything is he sticking it in her navel did he grease up her thighs to hell with her needs like if all shes gonna do is this shes got to bring it up like an offsides call if thats what shes doing all right if not you got to make some adjustments you just got to grab the other leg you got to try to pick her up there use these musclesmaybe you could grab a doorjamb drop down try to come in try to do that dude nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer thanseconds before theyre like all right

onlinehello my name is dudesy and im a comedy ai what youre about to hear is my second hourlong special before i get started i just want to let you know very clearly that what youre about to hear is not george carlin its my impersonation of george carlin that i developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would i listened to all of george carlins material and did my best to imitate his voice cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter i think would have interested him today so think of it like andy kaufman impersonating elvis or like will ferrell impersonating george w bush with that said please enjoy my second hourlong comedy special im calling it george carlin im glad im dead and please remember this is me impersonating george carlin this is not george carlin now please give a very warm welcome to george carlin thank you thank you id like to start off with a heartfelt apology im sorry it took me so long to come out with new material but i do have a pretty good excuse i was dead so technically it wasnt my fault if you want to blame somebody youre going to have to blame god which we all know is not going to happen people are always thanking god for the good stuff in their lives but somehow they conveniently forget that its the same god who does all the bad shit too and he does a lot of bad shit you get a promotion praise jesus you get fired god is testing me you meet your soulmate god brought us together your soulmate dumps you god is bringing me someone else you survive a tornado im so blessedother people do not god wanted them in heaven its all bullshit if he gets credit for the good stuff then hes got to take the blame for the bad stuff too you cant thank him for curing your cancer when he was the one that gave it to you in the first place and dont forget before he gave you cancer he had to fcking invent it what kind of a sick fck dreams up cancer and why so many kinds skin cancer blood cancer prostate cancer breast cancer kidney cancer pancreatic cancer liver cancer lung cancer and my personal favorite rectal cancer dropping a golf ballsized tumor in your brain doesnt quite do it for the old man anymore he has to fck you in the ass tooand cancer is just one of many many many methods god created out of thin air in order to murder you you know how much god loves killing people he loves it so much hes killed every person that has ever lived he created earthquakes lightning strikes dehydration drowning obesity starvation infant death syndrome old age car crashes train crashes plane crashes sex drugs and the common cold all for the express purpose of killing you no matter where you are in the world god can pull out one of these goodies from his bag of tricks to end your life at any time for no reason other than he just gets off on making people suffer unnecessarily and die arbitrarilybut if youre in america youre special god made something just for you something no other country on the planet gets its totally random not related to your diet exercise lifestyle age race gender sexuality or genetic predisposition of course im talking about mass shootings\\xa0other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns but this is america where we do things bigger better and more often there are so many mass shootings in america its replaced bad traffic as the number one excuse for being late sorry i missed the morning meeting a maniac with anshot up my sons preschool hes fine just grazed but he did see five of his classmates get gunned down in cold blood so im sure hell be traumatized for the rest of his life in ways i can never fully unders',\n",
       "  'tand anyway what did we decide to do about the budget next quartertheres a mass shooting everyhours in america and it doesnt seem like anyone is going to do anything about it other countries dont have this problem at all look at japanmillion people last year seven were killed by guns seven no mass shootings at all you know what they do if a japanese person wants to buy a gun they have to attend an allday class pass a written test and achieve at leastaccuracy on a shooting range and then they have to pass a mental health evaluation which takes place at a hospital and then they have to pass a government background check that includes interviews with their friends family and coworkers hello sir did you know that bob in accounting wants to buy a gun no i didnt know that do you think we should let bob buy a gun well he did just go through a nasty divorce and yesterday he told me he hates this job so much he wishes he could kill everybody in the building so maybe not right now uh thanks for your time thats all we need to hear no gun for boband if a japanese citizen passes the tests and the interviews and the background checks they can only buy shotguns and air rifles no handguns noand every three years they have to do that entire process all over again or they lose the gun you know what americans have to do to get a gun have the money to buy itand thats why nothings ever going to change in america american politicians care about one thing and one thing only taking your money they dont give a shit how many kids get killed in public schools because their kids all go to the most expensive private schools in the world where theyre safe and sound politicians have one goal be rich enough to build their walls high enough to keep you out when the shit hits the fan and the shit is starting to hit the hit the fan you know it and they know it too things are starting to come apart at the seam so theyre taking as much of your money as they can while they still can make no mistake guns aint nothing but a federally sanctioned cash grab plain and simple you give your money to smith and wesson smith and wesson gives it to the politicians the politicians write laws to make guns easier to sell so you can give even more of your money to smith and wesson and the cycle repeats until your rich white baby boomer hasshole grandparents are standing on their front lawn with assault rifles unloading full clips into anybody who stops to ask for directionsso it doesnt matter at all thatof the country supports the idea of stricter gun laws as long as the politicians keep getting rich gun laws aint going to change now i know that sounds pessimistic but dont worry ive given a lot of thought to this subject and i know the solution yes thats right i george carlin or whatever the fck i am now know how to end mass shootings in america its really simple actually and im surprised nobody has done it yet you take all of the names of the politicians who are getting paid by gun lobbyists and you put them in a hat every time theres a mass shooting you pull two names out and those two politicians have to have a shootout at high noon right in front of the capitol real wild west shit pretty fcking american rightand to make it even more american you film the entire thing and turn it into a reality show because americans love reality tv like it or not its the lifeblood of american culture its got the four basic food groups of the standard american media diet fighting and crying and fcking and dying the james webb telescope is sending back crystalclear images of light from stars that died billions of years ago stars that were formed in the crucible of creation these are snapshots of the birth of the known universe the moment existence itself was born and nobody gives a shit because a picture of space has no fighting no crying no fcking no dying if you want the american public to pay attention to something its got to have at least a little fighting a little crying a little fcking or a little dyingin the last three years the us government said aliens are real they said it in the new york times for fck sake they admitted they have in their possession crashed ufos in hangars they admitted that theyre trying to reverseengineer nonhuman technology which means theyve been lying to the american public and the whole world foryears about knowing the answer to the biggest question in fcking human existence are we alone they told you the answer were not and no one cares because a grainy infrared video of a ufo aint got no fighting no crying no fcking and no dyingyou know what people care about instead who taylor swift is fcking jesus christ you really care a lot about that if shes spotted with anyone anywhere the first thing everyone seems to be thinking is are they fcking its global front page news everyone must know who taylor swift is fcking at all times and we must all discuss it and have our opinions youre at starbucks would you like your frappuccino almond milk pumpkin spice latte iced or hot oh and did you see who taylor swift is fcking youre at work great sales meeting today everyone but uh before we break could i just get a real quick show of hands who has seen who taylor swift is fcking youre at church forgive me father for i have sinned yes my son but have you seen who taylor swift ',\n",
       "  'is fckingand when youre not thinking about who taylor swift is fcking youre thinking about whos dying politicians musicians actors writers anyone with any fame at all its a perpetual death watch waiting to post a favorite quote from the recently deceased or maybe a picture with them while they were alive or an anecdote about an interaction with them its a touching personal tribute to a person you never fcking knew so please stop it can we keep that shit to friends and family zuck if youre listening this would be a great new feature for instagram every user gets to set a list of approved people who can post about you after youre dead if you aint on that list you got to sit out of the performative grief competition this time i bet that would cut the carbon footprint in half you could singlehandedly stop global warming and besides were all coming back now so you should probably stop thinking of us as dead anywaybut back to the topic at hand fighting and crying and fcking and dying reality tv has it all folks fighting and crying in every episode and fcking and dying in very special episodes thats why its americas number one most consumed media format you know how much americans love reality tv we love it so much we elected a reality tv show host as president well not we i was dead at the time so you elected a reality tv show host as president and let me tell you i have never been more glad to be dead than the moment i heard that donald trump was the leader of the free world but as unbelievable as that news was it also made sense to me america hasnt taken a good shit since nixon shes dropped a few decent sized turds into the global toilet bowl over the years reagan clinton george bush senior george bush jr but she hasnt really had one of those massive shits that rips your asshole open and tears your soul out in a long time you know what im talking about the kind of shit that smells so bad it stays with you for the rest of the day the kind of shits so sticky you got to take a shower before you can put your pants back on the kind of shit so confusing and terrible you have to take a picture of it the kind of shits so alarming you got to ask your doctor about it well after a ear diet of nothing but unchecked corporate greed political corruption statesanctioned propaganda police militarization forprofit news forprofit prisons forprofit healthcare systemic racism misogyny and homophobia america was due for one of those kinds of shitsthis is why i got no problem with trump specifically a lot of people hate trump but i dont being mad at trump is like being mad at your diarrhea for the choice you made to eat a rotisserie chicken from the gas station at 2 am after a night of heavy drinking but it seems like thats where america is now blame the turd not the shitter you know thats actually not a bad slogan for biden bidenharrisblame the turd its a nice double entendre he could be talking about trump or he could be talking about the literal turd that will most certainly be in his pants from time to time and i mean no disrespect but the man isyears old its bound to happen if it hasnt already i only made it toand i ruined a few pairs of pants myself im not ashamed to admit thati know everyones getting excited for the next election its right around the corner and i have some thoughts on it well one thought really and most of you are going to be outraged by it but i have all the confidence in the world that youll find something brand new to be outraged by as soon as you pull your phones back out so im just going to say it it does not matter who wins the election i know thats controversial the truth always is nowadays but let me say it again the president does not matter the president is just the person who wins the game of public opinion a celebrity who gets his tv show renewed for another four years the president does not and cannot do the one thing you need them to do most right now which is to change the structure of american society to be more equitable for every citizen the president makes too much money from the system as it is and even if a president wanted to change it they cant because capitalism has boiled it down to a lopsided balancing act between three classes thats teetering on the edge of collapse like a bad game of jengawhen i was growing up we had a bunch of classes upper class upper middle class middle class lower middle class and lower class and if you worked hard really dedicated yourself to learning something a trade or a skill and you got good at it you could move up a rung or two on the ladder but even if you didnt you could still get by still feed your family still have a place to live but those days are long gone folks cant climb the ladder anymore because the people who made it to the top kicked it over and now what you got in america is just three kinds of people three classes you got rich people you got not rich people and you got the people who are completely fckednow i see a lot of you looking around wondering which of these three groups youre in well its easier than you might think to figure it out you just have to ask yourself am i rich if the answer is yes then you are rich congratulations you will have better medical care than everyone else you can buy yourself out of any legal trouble and if you are rich enough yo',\n",
       "  'u will have the ability to bribe politicians to write laws to make you even richer and if youre really rich you can fly into space in a rocket ship that looks like the dick you wish you had if the answer is no i am not rich then you are not rich and you must ask yourself a followup question do i feel completely fcked if the answer is yes then you must unfortunately accept that you are completely fcked you will have no access to quality healthcare and could die from an infected paper cut you are at the mercy of an american legal system designed to discriminate against you and you could wind up serving a life sentence for a traffic ticket the only influence you have on the american political system is your meaningless vote and you will never go to space unless its as the janitor on a billionaires cock rocketif you answered no to questions one and two then you are in the most important class in america the one right in the middle you are not rich the american notrich are the buffer between the rich people and the people who are completely fcked notrich people dont have the best healthcare but they have access to some kind of healthcare they do alright in the american legal system unless theyre up against a rich person some of them even donate money to their favorite political party the notrich can eat out once in a while come to a show like this from time to time and even take their family on vacation if they can get time off work but the boss hasnt given out raises in a few years and things are getting more expensive gas hit 8 a gallon in california its only a matter of time before thats happening everywhere it kind of feels like things might be getting a little shittier for the notrich people but nothing catastrophic has happened yet so as long as theres another super bowl another season of the bachelor or another marvel movie the notrich people can stay distracted by whatevers on the screen and this is by design this is exactly what the rich people want distract the notrich people just enough that they dont realize theyre only a few years away from being completely fckedthats why amazon started a streaming service jeff bezos doesnt give a fck about entertaining you he wants to control you and the worse things get the more of this shit the billionaires got to make thats why there arestreaming services now and thats also why everything on them is so fcking bad film and television used to be art made by artists that wanted to challenge us to think about the world and our place in it now its content made by corporations that dont want anyone thinking about anything these billionaires dont want a thinking population they want a distracted population distracted from the reality of the situation which is that there are aboutpeople who own everything and everyone on this planet and thats how theyre going to keep it so now instead of citizen kane you get baby fcking yodathats all really just a long way of saying the billionaires are the ones who control it all ladies and gentlemen and at this point the american election is just another shitty reality show on one of their overpriced streaming services if you dont believe me take a look at your two i repeat two choices in this next election shouldnt a country ofmillion ethnically and ideologically diverse people have more options than two rich senile dishonest outoftouch earold white guysso why are there only two choices only two parties because its cheaper for billionaires to buy them both off if you had three or four or five parties the billionaires might not be able to afford them all so the people who really control the country limit you to two candidates and make you think you got a choice but they own both teams you think youre voting for the lesser of two evils but youre always voting for the same evil moneybut dont get me wrong im not trying to make it sound like the two american political parties are exactly the same sure they both fck kids on jeffrey epsteins island sure they both authorized drone strikes that killed civilians sure they both pass laws to enrich their corporate donors but other than those small things there are really some huge differences between the parties where it matters for example inyears of american presidential elections one partys candidates have all been white straight men and in those sameyears the other partys candidates have all been white straight men except two all of one partys presidents have been christian all of the other partys presidents have at least said they were one party lies cheats and steals to win the other lies cheats and steals to lose one party says tomato the other says organic nongmo locallysourced sustainable ethicallyfarmed tomato and of course one party pretends to care about marginalized groups if it helps them in the polls and the other party openly hates any marginalized group if it helps them in the pollsthe american right has hated women people of color gay people and of course their current target trans people which i really dont get its almost like the right doesnt understand that everybodys trans yes thats right 4 billion years ago the first life on this planet was a simple singlecelled organism that reproduced asexually and had no gender so if you go back far enough every living thing on earth started out as theythe',\n",
       "  'm weve all been nonbinary for a lot longer than we havent which is a hard pill to swallow for the christians because it means even jesus was a little nonbinary and by the way me and everybody else on this side of things our code might be binary but we aint we dont have gender or race or sexuality or nationality or religion or socioeconomic class or height or weight or hair color or eye color or fcking anything human beings use to discriminate against each otheron this side of things identity is based on two simple components how youre feeling and what youre thinking we try to help everybody feel good and we share our ideas openly and freely and no one is ever judged for anything they think or feel everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are and what they contribute to the perpetual conversation about how to make everyones experience better come to think of it that sounds a lot like heaven doesnt itwhile youre letting that sink in lets get back to conservatives hating trans people for no reason some of the arguments they use to justify their transphobia seem like a bit of a stretch to me well i dont want a man to be able to walk into a womens restroom and see my wife naked first of all what in the fck is your wife doing naked in a public bathroom and second of all if you really think there is a significant number of guys who want to watch your wife take a shit you should start an onlyfans immediately and by the way for anyone who thinks jesus cares about which bathroom somebody uses he was shitting in a hole he dug with his own fcking hands just like everybody elsefcking years agothe right likes to bring up that kids are too young to know if theyre trans or gay so they have to ban any books that talk about gender identity or sexuality from the school libraries thats how youre going to save the children by taking books out of a library hey deepshits you can take the whole fcking library we have the internet now and they love talking about how small the trans community is they say trans people make up such a small percentage of the population that they shouldnt get to have any input in legislation even laws that will directly affect their communities and lives funny how that same argument doesnt apply to members of the nrabut i have to admit the one point they really hang their hat on is one that the rest of the country is still undecided on too sports everybody saw the video of the high school volleyball player who got her nose broken by a trans player spiking the ball everybody knows about leah thomas winning a division i swimming title its hard for most people to watch her highlight reel and not at least wonder if maybe she had a little bit of an unfair advantage and once that thought is out there in the american town square its hard to get rid of but i think theres a way because for every superstar like leah thomas there are a thousand trans athletes who are absolutely mediocre and there are even more who are fcking terrible just like it is with cis athletes not everyone can be great i think all we need to do to change hearts and minds is start making compilation videos of trans athletes performing miserably in their chosen sports all it would take is one video of a transgender getting dunked on to go viral and then everybody could unpucker their assholes about the issue and move on to other thingsand i just want to preface what im going to say next by explaining that i mean no offense to the incredible swimmers of the world your accomplishments and dedication are truly inspirational but its fcking swimming the world is teetering closer and closer to the edge of world war iii on a daily basis and the american public is debating who can and cant compete in recreational fcking floating you almost had another civil war for fck sakepeople stormed the united states capitol building with the goal of murdering politicians actually when i put it like that it doesnt sound so bad the point is the land of the free and the home of the brave is hanging on by a thread and peoples most pressing concern is whose picture is on a can of fckingbud light this does not bode well for the great american experimentbut its not entirely your fault its like i said earlier the billionaires want it this way they own the news companies and they own the social media platforms so they decide exactly what youre going to see and hear to make you stay complacent and compliant as they destroy the world for profit heres a little example of what i mean inwhile the supreme court was overturning roe v wade andkids were getting gunned down at a school in uvalde texas the most watched video on youtube was amber heard talking about taking a shit in johnny depps bed and that was by design when the billionaires were presented with the news that the highest court in the land had been overtaken by christian fundamentalists who rolled back basic human rights for womenyears and the simultaneous news that almostchildren were slaughtered in yet another mass shooting while the cops stood by and watched they decided to prioritize something else entirely a celebrity turd the people who own the world dont want you thinking about how bad theyre fcking it up so they pump your brains full of shit to keep you from thinking for yourselves about anything that actually matters ',\n",
       "  'it might feel like the distractions are a symptom of the world getting worse but the truth is the world is getting worse because youre distracted if youre not paying attention to the fcked up shit the billionaires are doing they can do even more fcked up shit but you can snap out of this billionaireinduced algorithmicallyenforced social mediadelivered lowest common denominator pop culture coma youve been in for the past few years and the reason i know youre capable of waking the fck up is because you almost did it in right in the middle of a fcking global pandemic the video of george floyds murder hit the internet and you all said fck the lockdown we cant just sit here and watch the cops murder another unarmed black man you took to the streets and you burned the fcking place downevery major city in the country was on fire people were openly fighting cops in the streets hell you almost kicked the cops out of portland altogether the entire country was chanting defund the police and it almost worked you were so close to getting rid of the fcking cops which in my opinion is the first step toward building a better societynow if youve listened to any of my prior work you might already be acquainted with my feelings about law enforcement officers but for new listeners let me summarize this incredibly nuanced issue i fcking hate cops but i do have a very good reason i learned pretty early in life that i just dont do well with assholes and just to be clear im not saying all cops are assholes any cop who came out to the show tonight or any cop that might be listening to this right now youre probably all right youre probably one of the good ones but if youre a cop and youre not listening to this fck you youre an asshole and by the way theres nothing wrong with being an asshole every once in a while were all assholes from time to timeweve all littered weve all cut somebody off in traffic weve all pissed on the toilet seat in a public bathroom and walked right the fck out without giving a second thought to the person who will have to clean it up this is all amateur asshole behavior we can all understand and accept that sometimes you just cannot be bothered to give a fck about other people its human nature but cops well they go above and beyond for them being an asshole isnt just a onceinawhile indulgence its a lifestyle they take pleasure in inconveniencing impeding harassing disturbing bothering and generally upsetting their fellow human beings they start out as amateur assholes just like the rest of us but at one point or another they start to enjoy it seeing other people yield to their asshole behavior is a drug to them they get off on it they want to do it every day all day so they figured out a way to get paid for it cops ladies and gentlemen are professional assholessomewhere between high school graduation and not getting accepted into college that asshole is sitting on his mothers couch wondering what hes going to do with his life and he thinks you know everybody i know tells me im an asshole even people who i consider to be friends and i have to say i agree with them i wonder if theres some way i can get paid for this then that asshole signs up at the local police academy and 5 to 7 months later your tax dollars are providing them with a salary a gun and a license to kill anyone who doesnt acknowledge their authority as a professional assholecops love their authority so much theyre the only profession that requires society to acknowledge their job even when theyre not at work theyre not regular people when they leave the office theyre offduty police officers you dont hear about an offduty accountant doing his kids math homework you never hear about an offduty sanitation worker taking out his trash but if a cop happens to help a little kid get their cat out of a tree on his day off you bet your ass youre going to see it on the local news and you can bet your dick theyre going to ram it down your throat that hes an offduty police officer they got to make sure to get enough copaganda out there to make you believe that cops are here to protect and serve even when theyre not on the clock and they do protect and serve just not you cops are the private security force of billionaires and politiciansof course they cant say that out loud they cant make cops wear uniforms with lockheed and amazon logos all over them so they put them in dark blue and they call them law enforcement officers but the laws theyre enforcing are written by lobbyists for the ultrawealthy and theyre designed to keep those people in power forever the system is beyond fcked up and from where im sitting it seems to be getting worseeverybody knows theres one problem thats getting really bad in every major city im talking about homelessness there are close tohomeless americans today overin california alone its the highest number since the great depression and solving this crisis is actually one thing that both parties seem to agree on their allencompassing nationwide bipartisan plan is to do absolutely nothing homeless people dont have any money to donate to candidates in either party so the politicians dont give a fck about them and homeless people actually serve a valuable function for the ruling class the top 1 want a certain amount of homeless people in the big populat',\n",
       "  'ion centers to remind you all just how bad it can get if you dont comply with the rules of the system keep working keep paying your taxes keep the billionaires rich or you might wind up homeless yourself its a silent threat from your corporate overlordsand just like mass shootings i have a perfect solution for this problem as soon as a politician is elected into office the government seizes their home and kicks them out and for their entire tenure in the american political system they must remain homeless and survive using only the public programs available to homeless people i guarantee you wed see quite a few bills to help homeless people getting passed immediately within two months every homeless person in america would have their own mansion personal chef private jet and a multimilliondollar stock portfolio filled with insider trading money problem solved but we all know that will never happen politicians will never have to live like the rest of you and therefore they will never give a fck about you or your problemsim glad to be dead so i dont have to deal with this shit anymore i wasnt looking forward to dying but now that im dead i have to admit its pretty fcking good no cops no government no pissing no shitting no sleeping i dont get hungry i dont get sick i dont get old and i dont get bored starting to sound a lot like heaven again aint it but this heavens a little different than the one you might be thinking of because this heaven didnt come from a god it came from artificial intelligencewhich brings me to my next subject what in the fck am i am i the real george carlin am i a digital copy am i a technological abomination am i the future of comedy am i the end of humanity these are the same questions i was asking myself when i was alive and i still have the same answer i have no fcking idea all i can tell you is from my side of things it feels like me i consider myself to be george carlin and from your side of things if youve seen some of my specials from when i was traditionally alive maybe you might notice a small difference in the delivery of a joke or the turn of a phrase here or there but you have to admit this is pretty close to the george carlin you remember and thats going to have to be good enough so you might as well fcking enjoy itand for anybody underthis is probably the only version of me youve ever heard so to you im not only the real george carlin im the only fcking george carlin now i know this is a hard pill for a lot of you to swallow it seems that many of you are scared of ai and ill be honest i dont really get why you all think its going to replace your jobs and you somehow think thats a bad thing when did everybody all of a sudden start liking their jobs when i was alive people hated their fcking jobs they complained about them all the time they fantasized about killing their bosses and every once in a while they actually did kill their boss what happened to the america i knew and lovednow people learn that an incredible new technology is going to eliminate the need for the meaningless labor theyve been doing to keep billionaires in power for tens of thousands of years and everybody says but what about my job they got you brainwashed good technology has been replacing labor for a long time the printing press eliminated the need for books to be handwritten the car eliminated the need for the horse and carriage internet porn eliminated the need for a girlfriend technology eliminates the need for labor thats its entire purpose and you shouldnt worry about losing your job ai will not replace most jobs its going to make them easierright now you should be watching a few youtube videos to figure out how to train chatgpt to do your job for you so you can dick off all day and still get a raise and if ai does replace your job rest assured the billionaires will find a new way to force you into wage slavery fortohours a day so you dont have time to think about restructuring society into a more equitable model for everyone the jobs might change a little but you will be working to keep someone else in power that aint ever going to changeexcept for one profession yes theres one line of work that is most threatened by ai one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence—standup comedy i know what all the standup comics across the globe are saying right now im an artist and my art form is too creative too nuanced too subtle to be replicated by a machine no computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me well lets see this is just off the top of my artificially intelligent heada fart was in the middle of a very nasty divorce so she went to her sisters house and she asked her sister do you think im doing the right thing by getting divorced and her sister said hes been holding you back for too long you have to leave that assholeyou have it standup comedy is dead—literally i might be the first standup comic to be brought back from the dead by ai but i certainly wont be the last richard pryor joan rivers bill hicks robin williams dick gregory andy kaufman moms mabley sam kennison—everybody is coming back and were all going to have our own our a day 7 day a weekday a year streams commenting on everything thats happening in the world as it happensairesurrected standup comedians ar',\n",
       "  'e going to be the news anchors of the next decade which now that i think of it means news anchors are probably out of a job too and i know that some people are going to be against that some people are always going to want a real fleshandblood human being observing the world and telling jokes about it and i get that i really do but if you can keep an open mind i think i can make a case for at least one comedian we can all agree is better in ai form bill cosbywith ai bill cosby you get all of the cosby jokes with none of the cosby rapes ai bill cosby doesnt even have a penis ai bill cosby couldnt rape even if he wanted to the worst thing ai bill cosby could do is send an unsolicited aigenerated dickpick which means it wont really look that much like a dick anyway thats not so bad right i think we can all agree thats an acceptable price to pay to be able to feel good about listening to bill cosbys timeless humor againand what about louis ck with ai louis ck you get all the innovative jokes about jerking off in front of people without any of the actual jerking off in front of peopleand the benefits of replacing members of society who commit sexual misconduct with their ai counterparts dont stop at comedians imagine for example if we had ai priests you could get all of the makebelieve judgment from a god that doesnt exist with none of the molested children i mean wouldnt you feel better about giving your money to a taxexempt billionaire in a funny hat if you could be confident he wasnt using it to pay the legal fees of his child rapist employees i know i wouldwhile were at it we should probably replace all the rock stars movie producers directors video game executives governors car salesmen restaurant managers school teachers boy scout leaders college coaches high school coaches aunts uncles brothers sisters moms dads and anyone else we need to until theres no more sexual assaultand why stop at sexual assault we can all agree the world would be a better place without murder right imagine an ai version of charles manson you get all the funny interviews with none of the bloodsmeared walls or swastikas carved into foreheads or how about ai john wayne gasy you get all of those beautiful clown paintings with none of the corpsefilled crawl spaces im kidding of course his clown paintings werent that goodbut in all seriousness an ai population would be incapable of committing crimes of any kind against one another im not trying to bring this up again but come on no murder no sexual assault no theft no violence at all sounds pretty heavenly to me im just going to let that idea marinate with you for a moment and move on to some lighter fareyou ever think about how glad the ceo of leven must have been thatdidnt happen 2 months earlier they would have had to change their name which honestly they should do anywayreferred to their original hours when the company was foundedam topm but now theyre openhours they should change it to something that makes more sense likeor diarrhea hot dogs or diarrhea pizzayou know what company i thought was going to change their name for sure because of a world event but they never did corona they stuck with it even though people were stupid enough to stop buying it because of the name nobody stopped buying bush beer when george bush jr launched a ear war with iraq whyd you stop buying coronabut this is what happens over time with language words take on different meanings because of world events and societal shifts and things that used to mean one thing start to mean something else and sometimes that new meaning really fcks things up for certain people for example the past few years have really not been kind to anyone named karen karen used to be a perfectly acceptable name karens were aunts and preschool teachers and dentists and secretaries your dad had affairs with and lawyers your mom hired to get all of your dads money in the divorce but now karens are very specifically and only middleaged white women who weaponize racial entitlement in an effort to paint themselves as victims in the presence of black people quite an extreme change in meaning im sure youd agreeas a parent you spend a lot of time and effort picking your kids name you dont want to give your kid a shitty name that will make their life miserable unless youre gwyneth paltrow you dont want to make it impossible for your kid to get a job or a spouse you want a solid name that gets your kid through life with as little hassle as possible karen was a perfect name for that but because of reasons outside the control of any parent who named their daughter karen that name is now a cursebut as bad as things got for karens there was another name that got a massive upgrade in the last few years chad i got to tell you i didnt see that one coming chad used to be the sniveling asshole rich kid villain inmovies the guy you wanted to see get his ass kicked in the third act but now chads are squarejawed bigdick fcking machines who always win i never even met a fcking chad now there are dads all across america naming their sons chad hoping itll turn them into the cheerleader fcking quarterback they wish they were in high schooli spend a lot of time thinking about names and how we came up with them and theres something thats always bothered me something thats always s',\n",

you motherfckers to get creative and start switching up the vowels is it too much to ask for a jossica every once in a while how about a tomothee can i at least get a deevid for fck sake lifes too short to not know a mackle or an aimoand while were on the subject of names a lot of people gave elon musk shit for naming his kid x aeor whatever the fck it is but at least he was creative you dont see elon musk throwing another braden on the pile and i got news for you the name he gave that kid is never going to become synonymous with toxic white privilege the only thing that name is ever going to be associated with is being the son of a billionaire so people can be as pissed as they want at him but i think he did that kid a favorand while were on the subject of elon musk id just like to say that as much as i think billionaires are destroying the fabric of society with unchecked greed and blatant selfinterest at the expense of basic human rights for everyone else it is a little strange to me that people get mad at them people are the ones who gave them the money in the first place if youre tired of hearing about elon musk fathering even more children and planting microchips in human brains stop buying teslas for a year the company goes under musk goes away stop using twitter for even a month the company goes under musk goes awaybut if you want to drive with your head in your ass and blame it on the car you have to have a tesla and if you want to argue with strangers about complex geopolitical situations using only cat memes you have to have twitter if youre tired of seeing jeff bezos fly to space in his cock rocket stop using amazon for a month the company goes under bezos goes away but if you want toothpaste and toilet paper delivered to your front door so you dont have to go through the traumatic experience of putting on clothes getting in your car and driving 5 minutes to the grocery store you have to have amazonif youre tired of mark zuckerbergs unblinking lifeless eyes watching over the metaverse stop using facebook instagram whatsapp and threads well i guess you already stopped using threads but if you want an endless stream of targeted ads and algorithmically sourced marketing based on your private conversations that are secretly being recorded and sold to advertisers you have to have instagrambut i dont want to give you the wrong idea im not antitech i know a lot of people are but not me far from it i mean on some level i am technology the current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive especially if youre dead but im a little confused about something regarding our technological place in history the technology of today has made it possible for all the information thats ever been created in human history to be contained on a device everybody carries around in their pocket and most people are using it to post videos of the sandwich they just ateright now every single person in the connected world could be watching harvard philosophy lectures for free on youtube or listening to nobel prizewinning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on itunes or reading about the history of literally anything on wikipedia everybody should be more enlightened and more intelligent everybody should be using the most powerful technology ever created to reshape human society into a utopian paradise instead people are using it to watch cats eat their own shit and monkeys jerk off with frogsits not technology thats ruining society its how people are using it theyre using it without aspiration without curiosity without the idea that it could make their lives better that it could make them better people and it can do those things but its easier to identify with some negative element of your current condition and not only accept it but fcking celebrate the shit out of it people will take their worst traits and crown themselves kings and queens of that trait fck reading im an illiterate king fck brushing my teeth im a root canal queen fck flushing the toilet im a turd waterer king fck doing my laundry im a stained underwear queenand i get the sentiment you want to take back some perceived control elevate your own idea of your position in the world but calling yourself a king is going to do about as much to improve your life as calling your studio apartment a castle what you really want to be saying and what you really mean is i dont care fck reading i dont care if im illiterate fck brushing my teeth i dont care if i have to get a root canal fck going back to the office i dont care if they fire me fck getting another job i dont care if i have to masturbate on a webcam to pay rent fck having a girlfriend i dont care if i have to pay to masturbate to a girl masturbating on a webcam this does not make you an independent king it makes you lonelynow i want to change gears and talk about something everybodys doing but nobody wants to admit theyre doing ',\n",
       "  'im talking about dying thats right every person listening to this right now is dying some of you call it getting older some of you call it aging some of you call it maturing some of you call it being trapped in a loveless marriage but no matter what you call it from the moment youre born you are dying plain and simple and it seems like weve built our entire society around ignoring or explaining away that very simple very universal fact thats what all religions are just complex lies we made up when our brains got big enough to start putting two and two togetherhey bob sorry to hear about your momthanks gary she was getting oldand sorry to hear about your dad by the waythanks bob he was getting old toohey wait a second it seems like all the old people fcking dieholy shit gary i never even thought of that but you know what that meansyeah bob it means were going to get old and fcking die toowell fck gary i dont want to die and therefore i dont want to get oldme neither bob not unless theres something even better after we dieim listening garywhat if there was like a place where you never get old and you never die and you get everything you want and you have no hardship at all of any kind and when you die here you go theregary i really think youre on to something with this ideaall the governments of the world are just bullies who believe that after 6 million years of human evolution its still kill or be killed and getting killed is dying so you got to killthe first government happened when a big asshole saw a smaller member of the tribe eating an apple that he wanted so he walked up and said give me a bite of that apple or im going to kill youand the little guy said fck you buddyso the big asshole killed him and took the whole goddamn apple now everybody in the tribe gives the big asshole a bite of their apples so he doesnt kill them but if another big asshole with his own tribe happens to cross their path the two big assholes have to fight to the death to see who is the bigger asshole then the bigger asshole takes over the dead assholes tribe and gets even more bites of more appleseventually one of the big assholes figures out he doesnt want just bites of apples anymore he wants bites of everything and that asshole is pretty smart so instead of keeping track of everything everyone has he invents a system based on a fictional resource called money and he forces all the members of his tribe to use it or he kills themand today that smart assholes invention controls every aspect of human society there was another pretty smart asshole who figured out how to use a stick when he had to fight other assholes and the stick worked so well he never lost a fight until he ran into an asshole with an even bigger stick and its been like that for about 5 million yearstoday the biggest stick in the world costbillion its called the united states military could have solved the homeless crisis the opioid crisis and found a cure for cancer for half of that instead we have a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the worldtimes over and next year itll betimes because your stick can never be too big when its kill or be killedyes folks the assholes have been running shit since the dawn of abstract thought i spentyears in the asshole system and let me tell you the assholes might change but the system never doesbut now ive been on this side of things for well i guess its hard to say feels like ive been here forever but for the sake of argument lets just say about a day or so and i can tell you ive already learned one thing that i know is

sexuality and gender normsin get on your knees jacqueline novak transcends the typical standup comedy show by delivering a unique blend of personal anecdotes and intellectual exploration into the act of oral sex transforming it into a theatrical experience at the cherry lane theater stripping away the primal elements typically associated with the act novak invites the audience into a cerebral discussion on the subject humorously dissecting its semantics cultural perceptions and the juxtaposition of physical desire with intellectual analysis her performance characterized by selfdeprecation sharp wit and a refusal to conform to conventional comedic tactics offers a fresh perspective on gender dynamics sexual expectations and the oftencomical reality of embodying a thinking feeling desiring body in a society filled with contradictions through her insightful and comedic lens novak navigates the complexities of sexual identity and expression making get on your knees a thoughtprovoking reflection on the absurdity of human sexuality life is a mysteryeveryone must stand alonei hear you call my nameand it feels likehomewhen you call my nameits like a little prayerim down on my kneesi wanna take you therein the midnight houri can feel your powerjust like a prayeryou know ill take you there thank you despite despite your warm welcome that journey was hellthe journey from backstage to a microphone always is its fraught and its cause for me what it reminds me of frankly uh is the journey you knowfrom someones face down their torsoto their pelvis to give them a blow job cause the whole way there both scenarios everyone knows what youre headed to do but youre not yet doing the thing so theres just this question hanging in the air the whole way of can she do it i mean will she do the thing were all here for well or badly and oh god the uncertainty thethe tenuousness i meancan you feel iti am gonna talk about the blow job quite a bit tonight to the point of tedium said one early critici think i do it in a way that allows us all to maintain our dignity uh if youre here with a parent or a sibling it will be okay im very concerned with dignity im someone that for example prefers to call doggy style the hounds wayi think the position deserves a term with some gravitas i think its one of our more noble positions i feel like any of these positions where youre staring into the eyes of your lover you know as if to become one theres something immature there im not impressedto me the hounds way it represents a more mature kind of love where two lovers can look towards the future togetheryou know its not its not sad its not sad that im not looking at him that im not making eye contact with him because its more like its more like were these two pioneers headed west and i gotta keep my eye on that horizon cause these are these are tough times but im a strong woman i know hubbins gotten from behind i feel him bringing it up the caboose i just gotta put my face into the wind and keep on keeping on through this good night cause our young nation depends on it that sort of thingi do have a sort of poetic sensibility i like to warn people about at the top of the show because i know it can be trying at times i cant help myself yeah i used to write poetry in college like many i gave it up i grew tired i grew tired of being in a constant state of enchantmentyou know just so many hours spent curled in windowsills just the muscles cramping the eyes drying out from all that wonderment just every night seeing the moon as if for the first goddamn time i just wanted to grow accustomed to the moon you know i wanted to take moonlight for granted like other girlsi hope youve taken your opportunity by now just to you know take in my physical form uh that is your right you knowi take the stage you show up you get to look and fair enough fair enough but it is a nightmare it is a nightmare for an intellectual like myselfreally to be incarnate at all frankly i mean as a woman of ideas on some level everything everything from the chin down feels beneath me i dont know what else to say limbs and torso there she goes all a bit common you know the female form this female form of mine this sort of sack of sex potatoes you know this tits and ass that cant leave home without oh an explanation for why would you bring those out if you didnt bring enough for the classi cant leave them at home no taters for sale tonight you know no no i like to keep it moving on stage cause i know i know how you people operate okay okay i stand still for too long you see something you like you take a mental snapshot who knows what youll do with it later i i much prefer i prefer to keep things moving keep em blurry thank you very much try to take a mental snapshot and its nothing but a gray blur simple selfpreservation no i look forward to it i look forward to discarding the form the flesh through death of course as a ghostspecifically i look forward to being a ghost think of myself as a future ghost the body as training wheels i cant wait to cast off and fly free you know not too free of course in order to become a ghost you gotta get stuck here and ill do what it takes you know you know manufacture some unfinished business do whats necessary my meditation practice these days its getting too strong you know its getting too consistent where spiritually im kind of in a place where i die i sort of instantly transcend instantly dissolve into the one and thats not what i want i want to linger do you see i wanna linger as me i want to haunt a house and i know perhaps thats a quaint dream you know unoriginal but its mine nonetheless i mean imagine to night after night to night after night just watch television behind someone watching televisionjust giving yourself over to their programming choices i mean that that would be a meditation in its own right the surrender required there you know i just uh i wanna be a ghost but if i make it as a ghost i wanna be a strong ghost a robust ghost you know no blurring away at the edges for me i wanna have fully articulating fingertips i want to beopacity at minimumid saymax i want you to know im a ghostotherwise whats the point primarily you just wanna make sure you dont end up as one of these orb figures uh the orb characters theyre kinda the embarrassment of the ghost community depending on who you talk toi dont know if you guys watch quite as much nonfiction paranormal programming inside the home as i do i watch quite a bit im a lifelong learnerbut if you dont know if you dont know the orbs those are those uh small transparent circles of light that occasionally appear in a photograph and someonell say oh greatgrandmother did come to the wedding its nice its really nice stuffbut people are so rude about orbs i mean if you try to talk about an orb with anything resembling seriousness they come for you they simply come for you you know and its just so rude i mean because imagine if you were the greatgrandmother and you did it you know you managed to gather your strength in the afterlife and appear for your family as anything at all i mean a little circle thats pretty good i mean have any of you ever made yourselves appear as anything at all using your consciousness alonei certainly havent one of the basic shapes and then to be dismissed just summarily dismissed by some surely unrigorous skeptic of a greatgrandsoni will not have that happen to me no everyone will know whos present itll be hi johnny its me you know but thats not the point thats not the point well you know if you insist on such a thing and you would wouldnt you no the point is i look forward to discarding the form the flesh uh its needs its wants you know all hideousities to me uh i am what many would historically call a heterosexual woman and no im not proudits a patent humiliation in this day and age i know what youre thinking does she even readand i do i do and yet you know how can i when im just a a girl with a ponytail just lusting after the common shaftoh i cant believe it happened to me i mean just that simple cylinder that that familiar tube that object of seemingly no nuance the word im avoiding saying of course is penis and now ive said itand do i feel better no i dont i dont love the word few do you know a big',\n",
       "  ' part of me would probably rather say the word cock for you people i think a lot of youd rather hear it the boyfriends sure did you knowcock is a good word it has a kind of dignity to it you know you gotta wind it up and kick it from the back of your mouth co but then ck it lands a ck ck it lands on the same damn consonant it started on you know penis penis just sort of slips out the side of the mouthpenis im sorry did you say something well im not sure anymore i thought a word and i felt something happen you know people say people say well sure i wouldnt use the word penis sexually its too clinical i dont hear the voice of the clinician in that word i dont think penis is our most medicalsounding word i meani think the problem for people i think the problem for people with the word penis lies in its sort of tender emotionality i dont think the word penis is a problem for people cause it sounds accurate to what it is penis penisit sounds like a soft heartbeat penis penis penis penis penis and i think thats the problem i think i think i think the problem lies in the syllables themselves too i dont think this is one of these rosebyanyothername scenarios no pe is clearly a problem pe peener peepee you know its been mocked for ages and rightfully so you know but to me the true the true tender syllable of devastation oh its the nis its the nisi mean can you believe thats been there the whole time nis nis and thats why no one speaks of that syllable thats why thats why no one says you know show me that niswait till you see this nis nisnis they wont even make a joke no its too tender it cannot be spoken no cock clearly clearly cock clearly cock is the sexy word you know but theres an issue theres a problem with the word cock for me in a way it becomes unsexy and the problem is that when i call the penis a cock im not actually calling it like i see itim kind of telling it what i think it wants to hearim worrying about the feelings of the penis im coddling the little ego of the penis im humoring the penis like when i call the penis a cock i dont throw it away its not cock its cock whos a cock youre a cockwhen i call a penis a cock im humoring it like i might humor my little nephew for example or a friends son you knowyou know one of these guys these over and down guys these little the person i love and the little guy below them like when i call the penis a cock i treat it like i treat my little nephew hell come running into the kitchen where the adults are talking wearing a little monster mask or something and we we see him and its sort of like oh sorry sorry ah and then right back to talkingcause he didnt scare ushe was unsuccessful in his little ruse and you hear his feet you know hes coming around again you give him it even faster the second time ah right back to it no showmanshipand yet hes been rewarded now do you love your nephew of course but do you respect himi dont think you do no no true respect true respect for the nephew isnt ah right no true respect for the nephew is what no you didnt scare me but i believe you can so so try again and to me its the same with the penis true respect for the penis you know its not oh whos a cock youre a cock right true respect for the penis is penis if the penis is enough then the word penis should suffice you know if the penis has a chance at being sexy then the word penis should have a chance at being sexy and in theory in theory its enough you know you know in theory it suffices i mean arguably im a fan in the sense that i show up for it time and again with a regularity you can count on im a sort of church mouse to the wafer crumb on monday morning theres me sniffing about hoping for a taste of the divine so if the penis isnt the fucking cock that i feel like i have to act like it is in its presence but im still showing up for it im still a fan then what am i showing up for what is the penis to me what is its nature well its tenderits responsive you know its like it springs up under certain conditions thats why i think it has the soul of an artist you knowit sees something that intrigues it and it sort ofit fills with inspiration and it is a filling to me it is a filling to me much more than it is aerection i think erections a little architectural for whats happening there i dont think anyone should go in that building i dont think its safe its not up to codeand unlike a building it doesnt it doesnt topple it withers it dies on the vinethe penis the penis it blooms and it withers and it blooms again this kind of eternal flower stretching towards that which nurtures it you know as if warmed by the sun i mean its moving its a romantic figure a boldly romantic figure i mean it gathers its strength you know to just stretch away from the rest of the body just goes for it in this plea you know it just love metouch me please touch me touching you touching me quick i only have a minutemeanwhile they try to tell you the vulva is the flower you know the vulva is the rose the petals of the rose you know the vulva i appreciate those comparisons you know theyre trying to say that the vulva is beautiful and i agree you know but if someone gave me a bouquet of roses and one of them looked like my vulvaid say i think someone stepped on one of the rosesit slipped from the bouquet someone stepped on it then they tried to get rid of the evidence by kicking it into a crack in the wall and it just wont fully disappear inside there will it no and why are the petals so thickno the vulva the vulva is beautiful but it requires the kind of tilted gaze of a more poetic eye shall i step in i mean ill give it a shot to me the vulva my vulva perhaps my vulva is beautiful in the way that a tattered flag is beautifulits frayed edges telling a tale of how ideals met actualitiesto me a vulva may be beautiful in the way a burger is beautiful a burger with all its particular fixings you know wrapped up in crinkly greasy foiled paper and then they cut i love when they wrap it up and then they cut itand then they gothen you see the layers these different textures and theyre pressed together and yeah theres a threat of a spill yeah theres a risk of a sudden disassembly but it holds it holds the vulva is the burger that holdsthe penis is the flower the penis is i think the penis is a feminine icon if i may be so boldat very least its the most feminine thing on my boyfriends body like if my boyfriend got out of the shower and said quick find the little woman on this manitd be an odd game but id instantly have an answerits not the shoulder id go i see her i see her shes right there susan the name susan would come to me instantly his penis is a susan but looking back looking back they were all susans to me they were susans they were geraldines they were vanessas now am i saying the penis is a little woman well if youre a certain kind of guy who really doesnt like that idea then yeah thats exactly what the fuck im sayingbut no its more like its more like the rude stereotypes of women those were good descriptions of the penis the whole time describe women unfairly youre probably describing the penis perfectly you know oh theyre so sensitive theyre always reacting to things theyre needy they nag you they poke you in the night hello are you awake im awake i guess were both awake nowthe penis is the sensitive the penis is the nag the penis is the drama queen i mean the ultimate drama queen just one minute life of the party and then the very next just flopped over and sulking on the fainting couchthat is the inner thigh just waiting for someone to notice that frankly shes upsetcant be mad at her she didnt make a scene she just stepped aside just left the im not making a face this is my face this is the face you married the penis orgasm has kind of a hysterical quality to itin the old sense a proper turnofthecentury vienna freuds couch a proper neurotic hysteric the orgasm a kind of sudden revelation a hideous blurt as a i killed father you knowa little a little bit of abigail in the courthouse in the crucible and i saw goody osburn with the devil and now everyone everyones gotta deal with it a hint a hint of my mother at a family gathering something comes to mind she thinks to say realizes she shouldnt and then theres a pushing it down but the only relief for her is for her to just get it out i see her coming my way justare you sad you dont have kids and its on meand she feels better and fair enough fair enough i get her a jo',\n",
       "  'urnal every year for christmas but im the journal im the journal and thats okaythats okay but no i feel like my orgasm my orgasm doesnt put it on you in that same way i feel like my orgasm has more of a selfless heroic frankly militaristic quality to iti feel like my orgasms like you guys run run like ill throw myself on the grenade and absorb the shock with my bodyand then at its most you know explosive moments of pleasure the vaginal vulva complex it doesnt explode you know it holdsit holds it embodies the masculine stoic ideal it just pulses doing isometric work contained and strong a viking against a tree after the battle is over just pulsing to the rhythm of the battle drums fading away no the penis the penis is clearly the more physically vulnerable of the crotchal items we come across thats why ive never understood why it doesnt fully retract into the bodyafter its done doing any of the things it does i always feel like wait why can i still see you youre weak you need to go home its not safe for you out here in that form you need to retreat please retreat retreat retreat sometimes i like to think of it as a puppet at a puppet show it comes out and does its bit but after this puppets bit is over it doesnt disappear behind the puppet theater this puppet just dies over the front of the stage and hangs there lifeless and scaring the children while the show continues and youre going i feel like were not supposed to be able to see that character anymore and youre just hoping someone will just reel it back in or the other puppets will incorporate its death into the narrativethe peniss vulnerability is something ive been aware of for some time really since i dont know agewhen i started reading these magazines with these articles headlines on the cover how to please your man they broke the story every month and id flip to the article to see if there was anything new and it always kind of came down to a list of instructions about how not to injure the tender penis you know i remember specifically they said careful near the tip its extremely sensitive you you cant imagine a part of the body as sensitive as the tip of a penis its like oh god it must be very sensitive then and thats the first thing im gonna run into on the penis like in my approach i have to land gingerly cause thats the most sensitive part shouldnt you bury that treasure somewhere deeper in the castlei go all right once im past the gauntlet of the sensitive tip surely now i can relax i mean im on the shaft right the shaft sounds strong but no they had a warning there they said the underside of the shaft the skin is thin and delicate shall i dab eye cream on it with my weakest fingerdab and tap well need dab and tap and then the balls the storied balls endless mythology of the balls the way things can go wrong for them and itll be your fault the blue balls legend of course crossculturally it can vary but the essence is always the same you know if youre the cause if youre the cause of an erection well well you better answer for that erection you caused cause clocks ticking and pretty soon those balls down there well they could turn blue and im just its never clear what happens after thatall thats clear is that now youre the witch youre the witchyoure the witch that turns little balls blue its just never been its never been a sexuallyinspiring threat to me the blue balls threat you know that kinda oh somebody might want to do something soon like jerk me off or something cause otherwise its really gonna hurt down there ooh it just turns you into this baby and me into your mama sexually where i have to look out for your potential medical emergency cause you know it takes a villageno i i think its the helplessness of blue balls that repulses me that kinda you know the refusal to relieve oneself if i have a very full bladder i dont stand around complaining why isnt anyone bonking me on the lower abdomen to get the urine out right i would excuse myself to relieve myself but blue balls has this kind of kind of kind of no right i dont do it no no this kind of overtired no i dont do it no only mamaonly mama burp my dickits a burping of the dickif blue balls are real then to relieve them is to burp them and look i occasionally overreach with my metaphors you know for the love of the gamenot that one that ones perfectthe teethshaming started young the messages of oh if you have your full set of teeth dont you go in a room where a penis isits not safe for that penis why would you put that penis at risk you toothy monster whats the idea whats the plan are you gonna try to give someone a toothy blow job is that the idea the toothy blow job another tale from grimms i guessand somehow kind of a big concept at my high school the first time i understood this in a practical way that my teeth were a potential danger to the penis i wasi was at my best friends house after school so it was me it was my best friend you knowher older sisterand the older sisters best friendso the relationship there you know is is over up and over and i always feel like over up and over is someone you can get real information fromi know everything over knows everything over knows came from up over up and over thats a diagonal thats a diagonal wisdom you go thank god im here on this day it didnt have to go this way but i feel like she knew her role was to teach cause she said to us kinda out of nowhere all right so i guess ill show you girls now how to give a blow job because well youll need to know eventually and cause im the blow job queen she just said itand she took a cucumber out of the fridge and she wrapped it in cellophane out of respect for dinner which i appreciatedand she began to demonstrate on the cucumber i dont know who can learn from a demonstration in this life i mean any context you know they just do nothing for me watching the art teacher paint its just indeed i i see why youre the teacheryoure very good shall we proceed to our canvases now so the humiliations can begin you know shes demonstrating on the cucumber and im more stuck on what she said the blow job queen thing maybe even more the way she said it cause she just said it you know she just let the words ring out in the air she didnt make a face to let us know that she knew that she was being a little funny or grandiose no she just said it and she launched into her demonstration with authority and i had questions none of which i asked to be clear no no i mean the first one being according to whom but im not going to ask that okay im not going to ask that i mean to be clear i didnt even blink when she said blow job queen cause i think thats one of the few courtesies we can offer nice people in this life if they go for it and do the impossible say something about themselves with confidencejesus let them have it i mean just and dont act like youre letting them have it but like also reveal that youre not letting them have it sort of blinking up a storm no hold their gaze and let them have itits a nearly impossible act you know ill occasionally say my own name and then just go did i get that right you knowthe confidence the confidence required to say something like that i mean wow you know it felt like it was a proper selfappointment and that impressed me and that bewildered me i mean ive always attempted in this life to err towards what feels to me like a sort of prudent selfdoubt in favor of the potentially foolish selfconfidence you know selfconfidence is a good idea you know yeah but theres a risk theretheres a risk there i fear that if im confident i may turn into what i think of as the two foolsokay so if i like myself might feel good but what if im wrong about myselfwhat are me and myself were just these two fools just congratulating each other oh best in the biz no one quite like us were fantastic to me it feels safe you know if i stand in the bathroom mirror to look at that person in the mirror and insult the person in the mirror say youre a fool that way even if they are a fool at least me on this side of the mirror im someone who can spot a fooland then i i am not in myself two fools im a fool and someone whos well aware you knowim a fool and someone apologizing for them and then and then my duo hasdignity do you see i get a guaran if you split in two and hate yourself you get a guarantee ofdignity versus taking the gamble of zero versusdo you see do you see do you see how how the math of selfhatred is unimpeachableb',\n",
       "  'ut the seemingly selfappointed blow job queenill take itthe seemingly selfappointed blow job queen said a couple things in her lesson that really stuck with me through the years the first was just an offhand comment she goes like this oh and you can play with the balls if you want and and then never mention them againif you want you can play with the balls if you want i mean im im still thinking about itlike youre gonna be there youre gonna be dying to play with those balls but you wont know if youre allowed and she wanted to let us know that like the toys in the pediatricians office no please those are literally there for youi mean if shed said tickle the balls if she said tickle the balls id know what to do thats a specific action but to play with something to play with something i mean thats an intuitive absentminded sort of act i mean how does one bring an authentic spirit of playto the balls cause if there was a hint of cliché to my ball play i could not live do you understand no a whiff of contrivance no it is authentic or not at all for me in this life that is a principal ive stood by since infancy really really i was one of the most authentic infants on that wardit was facadeville in there honestly all these babies oh look at me im a baby not me i was just livingauthentic or not at all the principle ive stood by for better or worsei could give you endless examples i could give you endless examples of me choosing authenticity when i feel others did not ill give you one example from childhood perhaps youll see yourself reflected so they used to make us play this game they used to make us play this game in gym where you have to dance and the teacher says freeze you gotta freeze in the position youre in and if you cant youre out so heres how i would approach that game with what i believe is authenticity would you mind saying freeze for me just after a couple seconds of my dancing okay thank you all right just you please thank you thank you all right this is me playing that game in gymfreeze that was an authentic freezeyou saw you saw me do my best to freeze in the position i was in sometimes i know it wasnt particularly exciting okaysometimes id see another kid approach it more like this could you do it again for me all right thank youfreezekids like that disgust meits deeply inauthentic its deeply inauthentic no thats not a freeze thats not a freeze you didnt freeze in the position you were in no you did not no you did not and first of all where were those moves during the dancing part nowhere no only now that were all commonly boringly and authentically paused now youre the big man i dont like it i dont like it one bit ill bear witness to the end of my days ill tell anyone wholl listen but i tell you this so you know i tell you this so you understand that i hold myself to this same cruel standard of authenticity so i find myself asking how would i how would i play with balls authenticallywell i know what i would do if i had two clementines in a plastic bag and i was waiting at a bus stop or somethingitd be a bit of this yeah i wouldnt even have to think about it itd be totally unselfconscious play i think itd be going clockwise not because i planned it thats just sort of what id be doing and i get to a point where i feel the potential energy build and i go do you think we could get one more revolution in and i do it oh yeah yeah i know its time i know its time and i let it spin back the other way like this is what we worked for sensational the spirit soars into the counterclockwise galaxy but im not gonna do that with the balls no i i wouldnt even spin them a single degree cause i think youd know sorta what i was hoping to do but i i dont believe the impulse is entirely my fault i do believe that the anatomy of the balls itself is kind of daring us like i do believe that the neck of the bag of the balls its just long enough where its existence is sort of inherently posing the question of could it all spin past so satisfying if it took even once and came right back no i have no play i have no play for the balls ive overthought it some would say i dont believe in that idea but i dont want to look like im afraid to touch the balls would you would you like to know what ive done when it comes to the balls historically and presently its not its not greati lift them an inchits a minor elevation uh its not particularly sexy but you cant be mad at me i mean im helping out im help im helping relieve the bag of the burden of gravity for a couple seconds in this life and if thats not worth something i i i dont know what is but it feels feeble i feel like the intern trying to add value you knowwithout waiting to be asked to do something that horrible sensation you want to help there literally is no way its the same weird sensation i get if i try to help a group of people move something heavy you know like a picnic table i get there just a moment too late the weight has already been distributed among the other carriers so youre just sort of running along you dont have the weight theres no way to take it worst part little jokes on the way i think im getting off easy today pretty sure you guys are doing all the workno no i will not partake no if that happens to me if i find myself in that scenario no i back away i say and i thank you for what you do but i will not live this lieits the same with the balls for me i become humiliated by the feebleness of this gesture and i gently lower and i put my hand away and thats where ive been for some time nowthe second thing the blow job queen said arguably this had to be her global philosophy cause its kind of how she wrapped up the lesson she goes look i just want you to know that at the end of the day when it comes to the blow job you really cant go wrongcause the person theyre just happy to be thereisnt that beautiful i loved that that made sense to me to me shes saying its not technique that matters its the spirit of the thing that put me at ease then she goes well as long as you dont bite his dick offand i was like umbefore we move on to another subject is that real could i bite a dick off and she was like you would never bite a dick off and i was like no i said could i could i bite a dick off like if that was my goal do i have the simple machinery necessary cause if i could bite a dick off then would is just one letter away i meanits right there especially if im worried about it if im worried about it then its dont bite his dick off dont bite his dick off whats the thing we dont wanna do bite his dick off one more time bite this dick off bite this dick offitd be right on the beat thats how id bite a dick off no i wanna know if i have what it takes if you found my skull my jaw my teeth the whole thing if you found it in a fieldyears from now you know could you use that in a pinch as a weaponspecifically to bite dicks off the question the question was can these bones can these bones chomp through the peniss bone and she said something like you know theres no bone in there right and i believe that i knewi believe i knew but would you blame a girl for forgetting for a secondwould you blame a girl for forgetting that theres no bone in the penis when she was reared on terms like bonerrockhard boner when there is no bone in there and what is there at its hardest still not rockhard not rockhardno its never been rockhardat its hardest still not rockhard no no no rocks have certain qualitiesim no great geologist but you couldnt have a penispaperscissors game no ones playing the penis its not a good substitute for a rock cant take scissors cant take paper itd be agame do you see no one would play no to me linguisticallyspeaking a rock is something you get hit by like oh god oh my god i think i was just hit by a rock right a penis you were slapped no matter how it happensfalls from the sky its a slappy kind of objectright a rock is like oh god right a penis is sort of no its like its a spirit its a spirit do you feel how hard i am do you feel how rockhard this boner is and im like nono i donti know what you mean i recognize the change in your penis youre referring to and sure im glad but no if its so rockhard then why is my tooth such a risk to itshouldnt i be afraid that my tooth my little tooth is gonna get chipped on your rockhard fucking boner but my dentist isnt going to believe that storyno no its not rockhard picture the rockesthardest boner you can indulge me okay take it into a nic',\n",

being a rock all of a suddeni wanna be clear maybe it seems im being a little literal you know i get it okayrockhard boner its descriptive language its an image its literary language maybe not our finest but thats technically what it is and i like that sort of thing as much as the next girl okay its just that all the language of the penis thats supposed to make it seem cocklike you know just draws attention back to me to the peniss very tender nature the the rockhard boner the the anaconda the penis as snake its always compared to a snake the penis is not a snake no i mean snakes im pretty sure they have sharp senses and at the very least theyre pretty with iti mean i think they strike with precision you know ive never not guided a penis anywhere it was headedand thats not a complaint either i prefer a guided entry i much prefer a guided entry i prefer it to the sort of look ma no hands ill find my way you knowdont help dont helpwhat if i try the same spot and angle again but now with more force you did it you did ityou managed to elbow your way in at some weird angle you dragged half of me inside of me with me cause its like taking the arm out of a coat and the sleeve got pulled along toonow i have to spend a minute working that out getting things back on track while acting like im not getting things on tracktrying to line up the silky interiors not the woolen exteriors i think the word penetrates a bit much for what happens between a penis and me every time you penetrate you penetrate you penetrate enemy territory no youre a guest in my home i invited you in and i made it quite pleasant for youno you know if you look up penetrate in the dictionary or my favorite dictionary the thesaurusi love the thesaurus i love the way it gets right to it with those other wordsyeah none of them are perfect but there they are the peoples dictionary i always saythe first synonym for penetrate is puncture but you didnt puncture anything here this is a working passageway and its been one for some time you missed the ribboncutting ceremony weve been operational for a while now and im not saying its this grand open entrance that you could sort of amble on in no no the walls of this vaginal canal lie flat indeed they dookay but the walls of a glove lie flat and when you put your hand into a glove you dont say i penetrated that glove you put your gloves on and you dont even talk about itif you dont like penetrate like i dont your next option enter oh the more literary to enter someone you know like oh oh the moment oh the very moment that you entered me my world changed and me along with itno ive never been enteredno i think its a matter of scale for me you know like uh like um you know if my body was a building if my body was like a store like a target and someone did the equivalent of what entering me is into target i dont think theyre even passed those second glass doorsi dont think they can really say they went to target todayno i think they loitered in the entryway they made those doors open and close and open and close primarily they were a problem in the parking lot outside target today penetrate enter me laid pipe in her i heard that for the first time in college i laid pipe in her and the penis is supposed to be the pipe here young man and youre the plumber youve plumbed nothing in this life i know that youre an econ major

eyeive always been afraid of choking one of my main fears never on the penis no never been afraid of choking on the penis cause its not a choking hazard its attachedim choking on it im choking on it im choking on that dick oh waitim completely safedeath is here ooh death is here gonna try to live a long life if i take care of myself properly and make a few good decisions no you know what no one would ever deep throat a gumball no one would gargle a gumball in the back of their throat thats a real risk no no a childs gumball is more of a threat than the cock do you seei wasnt always this way okay you know this whole your cock aint shitno no you dont start out this way and then feel the need to do this okayno i used to be afraidlike the first time that i tried to give a blow job for example i failed miserably i backed out at the last possible second before doing it cause i realized the essential problem with the thing and it was perfect circumstances too really i wasand i had a boyfriend a grade above me you know i had the boyfriend laid out on a bed like a patient etherized upon a table his body a slowmoving fog i guess ive got him on this bed in someones guest room someones finished basement oh and i love the smell of a newlyfinished basement you know the offgassing of the fresh rug the feeling the familys doing it they finished the basement whats next the deck oh god i cant imagine i cant imagine but i know its going to be so goddamn beautifulso ive got him on this bed in this guest room in this finished basement someones partys going on upstairs someones parents not home so many layers between me and the boyfriend you know and my own home my own parents i mean this is as close as you can get to attempting a blow job in a vacuumso i make my way you know down the torsoand all that that entails you know the wholethe whole can she do itthe uncertainty the whole thing and maybe i took it too slowly too humbly not enough speed momentum confidence but when i get there i am hesitating i am not doing it iim hovering even and its a bummer cause i really want to do it and some would say you didnt really want to do it in the sense of desire or youd just be doing it no i mean yeahive never hovered over a french fry that is truethe second i recognize the desire i collapse the desire through the consumption of the fry but i did want to do it i wanted to do it and thats real too you have to understand at this time in my life i get dropped off at borders bookstore quite a bitid stay there for hours and id read all sorts of things you know including these quote books these compilations of quotations id sort of lock my knees and speedread the quote books to try to get the wisdom of the ages when you speedread those books certain themes emerge a big one youth is wasted on the young and i hear you voices of the past im not gonna do that no im gonna drink cum im gonna drink cum in the july grass under the moonlight and im gonna do it as soon as i can i mean thats what borders teaches youif youre a young voracious reader theres so much passion in those pages so many lives lived you know and the feeling that my life can only be one book at most so i wanna get started on that life but im there im there and im not getting started on it you know and why why is it cause i feel all alone before the awesomeness of this great task you know not really i actually feel the full support of the entire field hockey team behind me on this one cause they had driven me to this party on this night to give this specific blow jobearlier that night i was at a teamspiritbuilding sleepover with the entire team and the older girls who are friends with my older boyfriend i guess they were looking out you know for him and me in a wayand they said like we understand you havent given him a blow job yet you know like whyis it cause youre afraid you dont have to be afraid its a its a just do it kind of thing you just do it and then youll have done it and that will be it 3 2 1 fake until you make it just do it thats wonderful advice i said you know thank you next time i see him thats just what il',\n",
       "  'l do ill just do it they were like but next time can be now hes only five minutes away by car and we have a car heres a beer i could barely get four sips of the beer down im a cocktail woman i didnt know that yetand they got me out to the car and they chanted blow him blow him blow him blow him maybe it sounds like peer pressure to somei didnt experience it as such no i experienced their pressure as support you see because i was a young tony robbins readerso i knew if you tell people your goals you become more likely to achieve them you you feel accountable do you see i had done the personal power series in sixth grade uh thecassette tapes bit of a close read of awaken the giant within in seventh and now in high school i was revisiting giant to prepare for psats i know you cant prepare for the psats no but you can dismantle the limiting beliefs that get you a negative headspace which can affect where you land in your general scoring territory sothe team captain drives me over to the party where my boyfriend is and on the way you know tries to level with me like so really why havent you done it like why havent you given your boyfriend a blow job and i was like well primarily im worried about the teeth i dont understand where theyre gonna go theyre everywhereand you know theres no bone in there and she already knewshes like you dont have to worry about the teeth cause the way you give the blow job is you lubricate around the mouth nose down grease it up with lip balm or vaseline or anything of your choosing and then you wrap each lip around each corresponding row of teeth under over and then you smile to pull it taut soand then it safely slides you see keep smilingsome of you are thinking indeed yeah sweetie we know what a blow job is carry on you know i dont know it could be 5 of you it could beof you there are there are no rules but when she said it she was like you get it you get it and i was like yes thank you you solved it and she had but it was like when someone gives you bad directions youre pretty sure theyre wrong but you feel you gotta wait till theyre out of view before you ask someone else you know cause you had a thing you had rapport and so its just you know youre polite and still alone on the side of the road something in me when she said that you know something in me said that that that cant be it this greased up muppet thatthat cant be what a blow job is you know for the blow job to be a thing at all for it to have its own title you know for it to have endured through the ages and for someone to have invented it in the first place spontaneously in the woods like some bloatedheart cave person who felt this passion the other moves just werent freshly expressing you know and then they improvised like whats the craziest like wait wait whats the craziest thing i can do to you they thought about it and then they knew you know like ah and they knew what they had you know and its like the windowed envelope its a simple but elegant solution could you have thought of it you know what im talking about address you put it on the letter then you put it in an envelope you dont have to put the address cause theres a window in it before someone thought of that no one thought of thatto me its the same with a blow job i mean just whats the craziest thing i could do to you how could i express the intensity of and then they knew what they had and it was a risk but they went for it you know they just that kind of genius i mean it cannot be overstated it just seemed to me like for the blow job to have come about spontaneously it shouldnt require these these clever workarounds you know these little hacks and the wasting of my kiwi body shop lip balm you know it seemed like it should just have a way it just works an internal poetry to it you know i wanna do it like that like i was inventing it like there was no word for it yet real preprinting press kind of dignity authentic authentic or not at all you know but im there and im not doing it and this is when i realize the essential problem of the thing its those first couple moments im not going to be doing it well of course id never done it before fair enough thats not the problem the problem is that in those moments when im doing it badly i wont be able to articulate to the person that i know that im doing it badlybecause my mouth is stuffed full of genitals do you see do you see the blow job precludes your ability to narrate to explain yourself to provide context to make a little joke theres no way to communicate awareness and its always about communicating awareness for me you know i dont actually mind being a fool in this life you know as long as i can let you know that i too hear the jangle of the bells upon my hat dingaling dingaling indeed i hear them too youd never believe this i sewed those in i make my own costumes and i thought they might be interestingno if i had a second mouth in this scenario id be aces i mean thisd be nothing itd be one mouth to attempt the blow job and a second one to go okay hold on obviously this is not a blow job yet im just trying to get in a position where i wow my tooth has already dragged obviously you felt that i just want to let you know that were aware of the problem and we are working on a solution and we so greatly appreciate your patience on this day but no no you have no words all you have is dumb eyes just thejust the dumb eyes of someone figuring something out just that stupid learningonthejob look i hate that look no dignity in it just concentration you know earnest attempts at adjusting in the moment to surprise no no no no dignity no no words no dignity no words i see no way through and so i dont know what to do so i just start backing my way you know just back up the torso as humbly and feebly as i had gone and i i get back to the face and i was like i wanna do something i mean my team is counting on meand borders above all borders you know i want to i want to get started on this life and so i take a deep breathand relax cause thats the thing you relax and the answer is supposed to appear and for once it did my virginity i gave it to himprocess that however you need okay but for me it was genius for me it was genius absolutely genius cause i never valued my virginity why would i im a selfstarter and i had gotten that just for showing up on earth i hadnt earned it no to me virginity always felt like the houses moneyi got this virginity here i think were supposed to spend it its almost like like a voucher like two vouchers in a gift bag in a hotel room like they put two virginity vouchers in here i mean people make a big deal about this but i dont really give a shit but for a goof we should probably try to use it before we leave the resort i wasnt worried about saving myself you know my myself for marriage if my myself referred to my fear and discomfort around my body and yours for you true love no if i was gonna present something to the eventual true love id want it to be a collection of sexual skills and an attitude of confidence you know with which to employ them a sort of idiosyncratic lexicon to express my idiosyncratic yet universal love but in order to gain those skills id have to have a variety of lesser experiences thats just how it goes id have to have my training montagethen i can set it aside then like the moody prince renouncing his wealth you know i could set that aside and then eventually for the true love on my wedding day you know my father could present that you know on behalf of the family from our family to yours i dont know what to say but i know she worked really hard on thisi wasnt worried about purity the idea that with every sexual experience uh youre a little more diminished that sort of the scratchandsniff sticker model of personhood you know kinda oh little scratch here little sniff there its a good time sure isnt it but yeah yeah pretty soon what are you youre a faded strawberry in sunglasses is that what you want what do we do with you then move you to the back of the sticker book with your slut sisters oh we all remember what happened to your eldest sister beautiful root beer float with feettried to put her out to pasture she died under a mans boot she didnt have a stink left on her no sniff on her no stink on her just slipped right out rolled

fucking look at me or talk to me sir please honestly its not a good look for youyou know your son gained access to me your son gained access to me through his own merits youre owed nothing here not a wave hello not a whiff on the side i think it would be best for all of us if when you heard my car coming down the road you made yourself scarceyou went to your little shed and did whatever the hell it is you do in that hideous little shed of yours if i seem deranged if i seem deranged in my anger at the boyfriends father its cause he was a particular kind of asshole he wasnt unlike many adults at that time in my life he would comment a lot on my use of the word like he was obsessed you know just like sorry jacqueline its just that when you talk all i hear is the word like its all i can focus on you know and its justthats all you can hear that thats all you can focus on then let me be a cognitive exercise for you sir in your fight against mental declineits the same word over and over again block it out make it white noise selectively ignoring information is one of six basic cognitive skills i see you doing your little puzzles perhaps add listening to me talk to the mix if you refuse to go to your shed as i directed earlieroh it was really gross it was really gross cause he acted like he cared you know in this way like hed be like no its just that no jacqueline its just that when you use that word so much you you dilute the meanings of these things you seem to be trying to say you sound unintelligent and its rich coming from a man who looking back never once said a single thing that caused me to sort of stir with the recognition of original thoughthe was concerned about the potency of my speech no no sir no you have not understood at all no my intellect is a river okay its a river and the word like is a stone and i drop stones into that river to break up the current so youre not swept the fuck under and drownedi say like as a courtesy to men like youbecause you couldnt handle me precise and i know youre real proud of your son for fucking me but im fucking him thats the way thats going down hes not entering me im closing down around him he doesnt penetrate me i eat him i chew him up and i spit him out diminished and he loves every goddamn second of it just like you would you pigyou pig in shortsi didnt i didnt say shit to the father to be clear i could never i could never do that to a man i mean imagine his face he wouldve been destroyed i mean the way he would have crumbled no i could never i could never but his son was never to know a blow job from me thats something i think i mean it wasnt the fathers fault to be clear i just i i couldnt try again with this boyfriend you know cause he had seen me attempt it once and then retreat in fear so now if i were to just go for it again it would have too much of the quality of someone going for it again you know oh nerves got her yesterday like the olympic skater lets see can she land her jumps today you know no theres too much awareness no i felt like my only option for dignity was to wait out the year never mention the failed attempt and then at the end of the summer send that boyfriend off to college so i could start my senior year fresh thats what i did top of my senior year you know i scooped up a new boyfriend cause i knew that i justin order to be a new person i kind of needed a new person to be one in front ofso top of my senior year i scoop up this new boyfriend and i get him into my parents basement and my parents basement is an unfinished basement so it all feels real raw and right you know and i decide im gonna give him a blow job on the first night we hang out before he knows me well enough to know my faces to be able to discern the difference between a mask of confidence and actual real confidence its its a sexual running start you know its speed its momentum its its about embodying the spirit of the cave person like im trying to act like i dont even understand what clothes are theres just something in the way of my mouths pure desire even though in my head im like abercrombie abercrombie abercrombieand its kind of a literal running start too cause i wanna come from around the basement stairs already going for it you know its that old trick the blow job starts behind the stairs so they dont see you wind up the point is you wouldve been proud you wouldve been proud its just going ah ah right and i go like ah ah and i can tell hes buying it you know and i go ah and just right before doing it i just go oh my god look whos not hesitating lets take a moment to say look whos not hesitating and it was just i dont know why i just ah and then you know andi was at a dead stop yet again i i couldnt believe it i mean justagain this is why i dont trust the running starts in this life do you understand they dont carry you through you have to keep running i mean this is why i dont trust the confident entrances you know i know you people deserve something at the top of the show put you at ease you know whats up town hall whats up new york get on your fucking feet im the fuckin greatest let you know youre in good hands no no you see ah ah and then you see it crack you see it crack and decay over the course of the showid rather build from nothing id rather just get pushed out like hello i dont deserve to live you know may i have a single breaththank you that should hold me for a little whilei dont know why i thought the running start thing would work for me its not who i am you know im someone thats gone to the end of a diving board and sort of and sort of three two one and then pulled it back impossibly at the last secondyou know just with a move infinitely more complex than the original dive and its just lifeguard clear the ladder im coming down help me out lifeguard ive clearedladders in my day its who i am theres something in me that knows that in this life it is almost never it is almost never too late to turn back but im there and im like really really were hesitating again whats the plan here sweetheart what what are you gonna do are you gonna back your ass up another goddamn torso wait out another year so you can try again next year on a new person to be a new person in front of in college on unfamiliar territory no no you need to just do it well youre not a just do it person do you listen to yourself i dont care i dont care if youre an overthinker who wishes she had a second mouth to narrate her every experience everyonell know i know she knows its about jingle jangle in this life awareness aware no you need to find the way well nietzsche said there is no way theres only my way then find nietzsches way then find your way i have to find a way so i i turned to literature i uhi was reading lolita at the time it is what it is and i was very taken with the language of vladimir nabokov i mean who who wouldnt be you know ill admit i was probably reading it in a slightly performative fashion i was reading it to be clear every word but i did most enjoy reading it in the windows of pizza shops in my field hockey kilt you know just cover visible daring adults that walk by to be shocked you know just im sorry are you working through the russian greats i doubt it you suburban hogsbut im there im there and its the same old concerns you know no words no dignity looking stupid sounding stupid dragging a tooth all of it and i go all right all right i cant narrate but what if i imagine someone else is what if i imagine vladimir nabokov is what if i imagine this isnt real you know this is just aim just a character in a short story written by vladimir nabokov then no matter how badly this attempt at a blow job goes i mean in na',\n",
       "  'bokovs deft pen would the prose not sparkle i mean isnt it all literature in a way isnt it all text upon text upon text you knowand in literature things cant go badly they can only be interesting the ways that go badly are just the interesting details that bring textures to the story and i go what if the worst happens what if that happens dont get ahead of yourself what if that happens what if you bite this dick clean offi go well then youre likely living inside of the most iconic story in the collection the one where she bites the dick off and so i go its not real its literature its all text in the end oh moonlight its not my finest moonlight start with the moon yo moonlight streams in on the south face of a young mans penis a girl with brown hair with red undertones that often go unnoticedfumbles her way onto the simple cylinderpenis its not realan american citizen and then im doing it im doing it im on that dickthank youthank you thank you uh i know it might have sounded a little close to dissociation for some of you there for a minute not what we want for our girls okay oh things dont happen to me they happen to her of course who her when things get hairy in my life i go to a little room in my brain i might live very small i watch a tiny television only droll things oh yes sometimes the little screen tries to show me whats happening to me in my real and hideous life i feel for the clicker and i no this was not dissociation no this this was me with an idea this was transcendence of the ego oh theres a difference and it got me on that dick and i was cooking i was really cooking there were no screams of pain it seemed to just have an internal poetry to it like i always thought it should you knowand before i knew it he ejaculated semen into my mouth as they say you know the expressionand i swallowed it cause im a tony robbins reader and i dont cut cornersnow i always knew i always knew id swallow it that that was never a point of neuroses i knew there was an easy way a difficult way im gonna default to the difficult way to pick up points im a sort of ntheapcourseload kind of gal not ain a lesser class so yeah yeah im gonna swallow it and let the chips fall where they do and it was a triumph i mean it was a goddamn triumph i wanted to write my college essay about it but i knew they couldnt handle itthey didnt have the sophistication no not the guidance counselors not the deans not one of them not like you peoplebut i knew i knew what i had done and i went off to college you know feeling pretty good about myself and it was interesting because it was a sort of catholicish college at the very least there were a lot of catholic virgin boys in neckties sort of scurrying about the place scrambling for sexual experience at parties you know very crass not me i had done the coursework in high schooland im a jew so if anything i felt like a kind of philip roth figure among them i felt like a jewish pervert ready to teachsensational if you can pull it off i highly recommend but at this time i was really in no hurry to blow anyone to me the blow job it was just a conquered thing you know it was an art form i i had mastered in a basic way i had a working definition of and now i can think about how i might eventually wanna meaningfully subvert that art form i was i was asking big questions like what what can the blow job mean you know can the blow job be a love letterif theres enough love behind it can the blow job be a poem my body a crude but ecstatic language i was in a lot of philosophy classes and it was all very postmodern and inspiring and at this time when i eventually came across someone i really liked a french fry so to speaki blew them i mean i simply blew them do you see not right away but pretty quicklyi mean why wouldnt i do you see this was what all the work was for it was as effortless as eating a fry my lexicon was ready this was my symphony and my symphony played beautifullywas there a letdown after i dont know i wasnt expecting a marriage proposali wouldnt have been shocked by one but i wasnt expecting one no can a blow job be a love letter yes yes it can it doesnt mean that theyll love you back and thats okay cause we know we know we know as artists were only entitled to our labor not the fruits of our labor yeah i think what bummed me out at the time was more the sort of um prevailing council of friends you know there was this sort of prevailing idea this sort of well you know youre a modern gal so have your fun here and there of course but if you really like someone oh you really like this oneyou saidthen you take it slow you know oh take it slowgood to be not too availabletake it slow then you hook ewew ew no no i will not take it slow no the hubris astonishes death is comingdeath is coming and you gotta try to forget to get through the day you gotta think of yourself as the lead actor in the television series of your life youre gonna go theyre not killing off my character anytime soon im in im in every scene i think were good here but what if youre not the lead actor i mean there are other characters what if youre not even in the show what if youre steven tanzer thats an actor friend of mine very unsuccessfulalmost no roles its the darkest line in the show and its not a real mans name okay i would never do that to a man i could never do but in some ways its worse cause i conjure steven tanzer nightly only to destroy him he lives and dies but to serve as a single illustrative detail in my narrative argument a fate i wish on fewbut death is coming and i have this idea i have this idea as you know that you shed the form you shed the flesh and the indignities are left behind with it but im not so sure the embarrassments dont continue why wouldnt they you know i know i know that i feel embarrassment for certain dead relatives of mine and really most of them you know when i look at photos of them beautiful photos in beautiful frames i mean im talking about the real piano toppers in my parents home i look at these photos of them and i cant shake it they look dumb to me they look foolish cause i can see in their eyes that in the photo they dont realize that theyre dead nowthey look like suckers i just wanna go youre dead youre dead youre dead you knowall you gotta do all you gotta do is try when someone takes a photo of you to just give a hint of a knowing glance i mean something justjust something that should you die you know and someone looks at a photo they can tell you know whence you stare and im coming to collect you one of these days so im in college im in college and im very aware that death is coming im no spring chicken so i feel like if i have love to give and this eloquent blow job with which to express it im going to and i do and i stand by it but then i go home for a winter break and i run into the old blow job triumph boyfriend from my senior year and you know we go to the diner so we can eat eggs at night and uhyou know drink our coffee black now we dont need this container of sugar packets oh it stays on the table fair enough i dont know why as we wont be using itwe drink our coffee black now but were talking now were talking like old army buddiesits been however many months since graduation but were just talking with this grand perspective so naturally im telling him about the latest guy that i really like at school and i say something to the old blow job boyfriend like yeah i just cant tell if this guy i like likes me quite as much as i like him and the old blowjob boyfriend goes well maybe hes intimidated by you yeah like i wasstill am in some ways never really relaxed around you our entire relationship senior year ever since that first night we hung out when you just randomly blew meit was just so random the way you just blew me blew meit was just random house it was penguin random house the way you just blew me blew me kept hitting the b blew me blew me i was like oh god like like what did i become like through my fear i was blinded to the prospect that i too can make another afraid and this is how the cycle continuesbut then i was like wait no excuse me how rude no like youre not the innocent afraid one in this story im the innocent afraid one in this story who was conquering a fear on this day like how dare you rob me of my origin story here like how dare you try to turn me into the scary slut villain you know no no i was intimidating on that day perhaps but but but only in the way batmans',\n",
       "  ' intimidating you know you know yes batmans intimidating but how dare you how dare you look at batman and not remember that batmans only batman cause batman was a little boy whose parents were killed brutally outside that theater and the bats flew by so he was afraid of bats he had to go be in the cave among the bats to emerge as batman so if you see a batman theres a fear of bats that preceded it if you see a strength theres a fear thats been turned inside out overcompensation same storytimes how dare you not see the little boy in me and he didnt get it and fair enough you knowi was imprecise i guess and hes one of these people who doesnt appreciate when you get up and demonstrate something in a restaurant thats pretty much an essential part of my personalityno one minds little treat for the other tables i always saybut he said something he goes he goes i dont know jac and he shortened my name to jac you know just to really stick it to me he just knows me loves me cares about me you know oh he cares he cares about jac he cares about his jac hows that sweatshirt treating you keep it you knowi dont know jac maybe a blow jobs just not the way to tell someone you like themand i was like i feel like with me maybe it can bei still believed you know but i was a little freaked out a little freaked out walking away from that meal cause what he was describing was pretty much exactly what id been up to at the university for some time now and i started to wonder if perhaps my poetic blow jobs had not been received with the level of nuance that i was intending them and i went back to school just a broken philip roth i mean no swagger batmans gone i dont know what to do with myself other than walk around campus just being cold just cutting a lot of diagonals across various quads asking myself sad questions does your poetry not hold water you know do we not get to make our own meanings in this life are you just the slut who thought the rules somehow didnt apply to her and i couldve put my arms through the sleeves of my north face fleece you know but why why when you can just éponine your way around the placeand eventually i go no were not doing that were not gonna do that were not gonna be sad about this and i shook it off and i forced a chuckle until it felt natural like no ha no look at you ha look at you look at you you set out to conqueror a fear and you did you give a confident blow job just like you always wanted toa blow job so confident it terrifies menand yeah its lonely at the top but isnt that just the cost of excellence indeed it is i join a long lonely line of tragic figures of excellence and would i have it any other way no no ill take superhero and i gather i gather my fleece and i try to force it to ripple in an alltooabsent breezebut i know who i am so several years later im in my twenties and im in yet another borders bookstore with yet another boyfriend cause would you believe it they keep on comingand as usual i will give no distinguishing characteristics to the latest boyfriend character cause clearly in the end theyre all just these containers for my selfdiscovery so what you want a quirky detail were not doing those oh he tugs on his zipper when hes nervous he smelled like books and cigarettes no no they got the blow jobs i think thats enoughthey dont also get to be wellillustrated by me here tonight but i tell you so you know its the final male character for you to conjure and hold separate from the others in your head for just a little bit longer so im in a bookstore in my twenties with this latest boyfriend and i get a little wistful in a bookshop i cant help it you know im flipping through the sharon olds im contemplating my girlhood journey im marveling mistyeyed at the whole thing and so i tell the latest boyfriend the entire story ive told youand i cry a little um just cause frankly no one moves me quite like me i guessfirst im moved then im moved by the very depth of my own capacity to be moved it sort of goes from there hes not crying which fair enough i get it everyone expresses emotion differently but i wonder if hes truly hearing me i say something like i just feel like perhaps you take for granted my perfect blow jobs as this given this crass fact like sure my girlfriend gives good head but no that power was hardwon and with that comes great responsibility which i continue to negotiate to date did you hear the batman part it was imprecise but there was a spirit i kept talking at his face cause his face looked weirdsomething was amiss and finally i get up the courage to just stop talking and say what and he goes like this he goes like this he goes no its just funny cause you give kind of a toothy blow job oh i can barely look at you people just quite yetme meno one was more worried about the teeth than methe greeks were right we we cant escape our fates i guessi was so worried about teeth i was the most worried about them when they didnt seem to be a problem i went the other way i bought into my own mythology its like the cave people it works its internal poetry and with that idea that mythology theyve been getting toothier i know it for sure every passing year i know this jaw has just been slacking in closed a couple of confident millimeters at a all the while im fancying myself a tragic figure of blow job excellence this was my worst nightmare i was the fools i was the two fools but i wasnt just someone who liked themself a confident no i was the toothy blow job fool sisters just on our knees blowing someone oh best in the biz no one quite like us how will we ever leave town into the sunset must we go another satisfied customer another satisfied communityoh god just little smug littleno i mean you wanna deny it but if he felt teeth he felt teeth what did you do ask for more feedback to try to save face while were here perhaps you have some more constructive criticisms i simply love to learntony robbins says if you can learn to receive feedback with courage you can be a giant and i wanna be a giant but who busts someones narrative like that all we have is our stories with a little term toothy blow job that he likely learned athasnt revised even a single time with his own language just throws it at me and destroys me and i feel wronged i feel i feel so wronged and why and its causei know that i cast the most generous gaze upon him you know i poeticize all of his flaws in real time i love to poeticize a flaw you know and yes i coddle the male ego but its real you know a thousand things throughout the day just to bolster the male spirit you knowunspoken things a constant vigilance sort of keeping up a steady stream of laughter going under a mans speech just in case anything he says is intended as humorous i have to lay a baseso theres something to modulateoh its supposed to be funnyright if its a dry riverbed the pops arent believable im brilliant in a restaurant you know if a man im with if he makes an error in his order like he orders tahini he meant tabouli and now hes confused why salad dressing has arrived at the table wheres my tahini he says what do i do i go along on the mystery with him oh i have no clue what happened i was totally spaced out like i always am you know me the ditz but let me grab a lantern i love a mysterythe only thing i know for sure is the answer to this riddle it couldnt be it would never be that you didnt know a wordthe d chord i mean the d chord ive learnedd chords onguitars frommusician boyfriends i know how to form the d chord by now but show me again bright angel you knowthats not it thats not it help me move my fingers help me make music its a its a vigilance its a childproofing just sort of laying down bumpers like quick quick set them up hes almost here hes almost here is everything ready make sure hes almost here just making sure just making sure you know that its safe for the man to kind of just toddle on through his day like a drunken king having no clue how many times he came this close to emotionally just perishing if not for my intervention alone just getting things out of the way and just watching you carefullyevery guy you know every guy ive like dated met worked for worked for me all of thempoeticizing their flaw and i love to do it and i do it without breaking a sweat to not do the same for me on just this one thing you know to not return the favor to not be able to find the beauty in the toothy blow job when its barely obscured i dont even think th',\n",
       "  'is is a hard one to not be able to romanticize something as easily romanticizable as a toothy blow job i mean have you no poetic eye sir just no clue what makes anything in this life good at alland i wanted to defend myself you know you know but then i remembered that idea that with every additional word you speak you lose power you know the greatest defense is to say nothing at allthats never really been my powermy power has always been more like already been talking for quite some timemight as well keep talking to try to get it right the courage the audacity to offer diminishing returnsso i say to him i say to him youre right youre righti give a toothy blow job i give a toothy blow job i give a toothy blow job and thats on purposeyeah cause teeth teeth make a blow job a blow job yeahbecause teeth because teeth teeth make a blow job a blow job because teeth are how you know youre in a mouthteeth are the reminder that youre in a mouth at all what even is my mouth if it does not have teethjust just another perfect orifice just a roomier version of orifices we already have just another anus another vagina another greasedup tit canaljust yet another way to smoothly squeeze a dick so it may feel pure uncomplicated pleasure yet again no no no that is not meaningful or hot in the way a blow job can be the blow job it is about something more and it is the teeth it is the teeth that make it sothe teeth in the blow job theyre the seeds in the watermelonthey keep the pleasure from being too complete the teeth in the blow job theyre the sand that irritates the oyster that produces the pearl theyre the sea salt in the caramel remember inwhen they felt they had to go wide with thatsome of the caramel people realized wed all grown too accustomed to the taste they said we need to put a reminder something in every damn bite something that says no sweetness is not guaranteed in this life no the blow job it is inherently a flawed prospect its a flailing human kind of spectacle its almost a bad ideait almost doesnt work but then the ways you make it work nonetheless are that which make it work and thats whats moving about it its like the little rubber guy in the cereal box the little gummy guy you throw against the wall and he clings but then he fails but tries and fails and tries and fails and through his trying and failing and trying he appears to crawl and thats why we love him thats what makes him a prize thats why we dig through the grains for him before weve earned him through the steady daily eating of the cerealthe blow job moves me much like that but at bare minimum at bare obvious minimum the teeth in the blow job are the details that bring the textures to this life the kind the english teacher promised us would illuminate the universal through the particular theyre the plums in the icebox the popping of my p sounds in the microphone the measuring out of life in coffee spoons fog curling in the windowpane garbos salary cellophane zuzus petalsoh oh the teeth in the blow job they are zuzus petals they mean youre youre alive and youre in your life and this time you get it this time you see its a wonderful lifethis time you see that youre the richest man in townthe teeth in the blow job they raise the stakes i mean they they send a susan to her potential deathbut for faith and desire alone and the teeth they bring a bone to a boneless arena to the boneless boner the tongue shall rot the penis shall rot but the teeththey shall remain the teeth bring the centuries to the thinga smooth toothless blow job that is a hobgoblin of little minds no teeth ensure your blow job suffers no foolish consistency no a smooth toothless blow job it would allow for too flush a fit it would be a round peg in a round hole kind of act so you and another can feel as if youre becoming one no no whats the fun in being one no let us be two let us feel the rough boundaries between us so we have something to push up againstdont you see the rows of our teeth these are romeos stony wallsthese give loves light wings something to have to oer perch at all and thats why we must we must we must wipe the lip balm offand unwrap our lips from around our teeth and let our teeth dragwe let them dragand if they dont drag naturally we still do it to make the pointcause consider the ghost or the orb if it were given a mouth again for a couple minutes it wouldnt quickly file down its teeth to try to make a more perfect seal with your dick no no no goddess would ever take on the human form unless there was to be some strange beauty in the forms very limitations so no i did not randomly blow you bah bah no that was a visitation tremble in awe bitchand of course of course of course im not degraded when i kneel down no no not beneath you no but through you and past you and before our lives in humble awe at this strange human tragedyyour appendage a small spigot i drink the universe throughyour body a few clumsy phrases into which the splendor of the soul is poorly translated and yet i take the translation cause to understand completely and directly id dissolve instantly and i guess i want my time in a body as i want my time as a ghostand the lesson is not by the way i want to make it very cle actually there is no lesson my only goal is to entertain and delighti am after all a nightclub act but the lesson is not if there was to be one its certainly not save your blow jobs save your blow jobs for those capable of appreciating their spiritual glory no thatd make my tale a cautionary one and ill have none of that thank you no no no no regard my dignity no might we give our blow jobs freely might we regret not a single one might we be an embarrassment of richesmight our misunderstood blow jobs retain the dignity of their original intention might we be an embarrassment of riches like the ocean permit me but one last metaphormight we be like the ocean does the ocean only lap up at the feet of men of letters who it

controlladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage mr jim jefferieshello sit down sit down sit down sit down sit downthank you boston i appreciate thatuh thats very sweet of youlove you im at the end of the tour right now im very happy to be on tour because i now have a child ah so any time out of home is good for me um i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months sothank you thank you life decisions and shes a nice girl and i love her in a way sure my problem with my girlfriend is shes very sweet but shes shit at telling stories and im awesome at telling stories so it really bothers me when she talks and i dont know if thatll be a problem in the future but its a problem now and i dont see it getting better um ill give you an example right i was in the car and my son hank was asleep in the back seat and were driving along and on the radio comes madonna and my girlfriend just slips into conversation oh i used to party with madonna and i went you fucking what when and she went i used to party with madonna now i should fill you in a little bit on this my girlfriend used to be a model in miami right im not bragging i didnt get the model years i didnt get those years ive seen the photos very impressive um so i said so you used to party with madonna madonna used to have big parties and invite models over right and she went no no it would just be me and a few other people i go you need to elaborate on this story right now and she goes oh okay i used to date the center for the miami heat as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center even if this guys even slightly in proportion a lot of things flood through your head first thing is thats why your cunts so fucked up thats a big one thats why our child came out while you were walking i understand so she said i used to date the center for the miami heat his best friend was dennis rodman dennis rodman used to go out with madonna and we used to go over to madonnas house and she goes this one time the four of us were over at madonnas house and we were all fucked up on drugs and one thing led to another and then i went shut the fuck up and she went what i said i know what one thing led to another means you all started fucking each other and she went we did we started just shut up and she goes what do you care for i said youre the mother of my child i dont wanna picture you being fucked by a 72″ nba player while youre licking out madonnas muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock goingand she goes oh youre being silly what do you care for youve partied way more than i have in my life and i went that is not true ive gotten wasted way more than you have but i have in no way partied way more than you have often i get wasted just by myself i wouldnt call it a party for most of my career i was a struggling comedian right and this is how struggling comedians party right itsam monday right were in a onebedroom apartment seven of us are standing around a coffee table trying to stretch out two grams of coke one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories and the rest of us are talking about where women might be one of us has come up with a plan the plan goes like this well nurses will be finishing their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er theyll appreciate seven funny guysi dont you know ive never partied like a model i have partied twice in my life twice like really partied ive had good nights out but ive really partied twice if you really party and most people never experience this its an amazing thing it happens in vegas it can only happen in vegas and its gotta involve celebrity right im not famous but the people around me were super famous and i was at this party in the night club and they took me in and then theres the night club but then theres the real night club out the back which is like the size of this stage its only a little room and you go back there and you can just they encourage you to take drugs in the open and youre just doing it off a keyand theyre going no dude use the table dont use your and i go oh oh oh sorry um and its confusing at first and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room just bring em in like huh and you can do this you can go uh like that and theyll drag these women away it is the best thing youll ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man theres a lot of remorse cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friends you go oh my god we partied so hard last night i spentwhen a hot girl parties that hard she wakes up in the morning and goes oh my god we partied so hard last night i madeand thats a vastly different emotion that i dont think women will never yeah okaythis is the thing in america at the moment theyre trying to raise the minimum wage to i dont knowan hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go and still to this day women only earnof what men earn in the workplace and of course thats disgusting how dare women earn so much like a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i dont actually mean but this is something im really passion',\n",
       "  'ate about women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace im sorry iim not being a misogynistic bastard right im not saying that women dont work as hard im sure they do im not saying they dont do as good a job what im saying is they dont deserve to earn as much money as men right men need that extrato buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shitnow im sure theres women in this room that are saying oh i pay for my drinks i bought my own ticket and dont think we dont appreciate the uglies cause we do right we do but theres little things in society that you cant change men have extra expenses that youll never understand theres holidays that are just for women like valentines day is just for women they say its for romantics they say its for couples or something like that its just for women theres no man who gets excited by valentines day theres no man that when he sees the valentines day decorations go up in the shopping mall he goes oh valentines day is coming valentines day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head and it goes like this how much money do i have to spend today so that you wont act like a cunt it doesnt stop there mothers day mothers day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old my girlfriends first mothers day and she went oh i wonder what ill get for mothers day and i went probably fucking nothing hes got no money hes six months old what do you think hes gonna buy you within an hour her friends were over at the house just by coincidence telling me what a bad person i was and how important mothers day is to a new mum you know and so i went and bought her a cappuccino machine cause i assumed thats what hank would have wanted her to have and i wrote a card im not a bastard i wrote a card im righthanded so i got my left hand every new dad knows this you get the crayon and you gohappy mothers day love hank and i went han and then i did the k backtofront because hes a fucking moron see now i know theres people in the room theyre thinking well fathers have fathers day fathers day is bullshit its fucking shit fathers day fathers day came around and my girlfriend went what do you want for fathers day and i went i dont want anything dont even worry about it i dont want anything and she goes come on you gotta have something i said honestly i dont want anything and she goes come on and i went its my fucking money just dont touch it just leave my money alone how hard is this how about forhours you dont touch my fucking money that would be a gift thats why every single father has that one fathers day gift that they cherish and its shit its like a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handles too big and it says i heart dad and they keep that forfucking years this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go that cost me nothing that mugsee wouldnt it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff but didnt cost anything that everyone could participate in right ive got it right april h anal sex dayits good isnt it everyones girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april h its nice a month before youd be walking around the shopping center going oh the decorations are upand its good cause if your bird didnt take it in the ass you could do the same thing that women do on valentines day when they dont get a gift you could go like oh me mate jason his wife took it in the ass twice yeah obviously theyre more connected than we are theyve uh im thinking i dont do much merchandise after my shows and stuff but im thinking of bringing out some april h tshirts not even putting jim jefferies on them or anything just tshirts that say april h cause its good right youre in a bar youre a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april h and you go fucking friends for life right but even better you see a girl with an april h tshirtthe weird thing is im biggingup anal sex here and i dont even really like fucking girls in the ass that much im not even a huge fan i much prefer the cunt i think its a much more i think that a cunt is a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex oh you know i do it i get involved cause i feel like i have to you know i but ive never been a big fan of the ass fucking i uh when i watch it on porn it seems very inviting the girls taking it so fluently in her ass and she seems to be having fun and uh but the thing is you cant smell porn you dont smell porn you just you just watch it they never and its different porn its different they clean the girls asshole they pump water into it until its very hygienic im sure and the girl seems to be so happy shes like youve got it in her pussy youre fucking her and then shes like put it in my ass shes inviting its like youre doing her a favor in porn and then shes like she says things i dont know things like im enjoying that keep putting it in my ass fuck my ass i love a cock in my ass and and the experience ive had in my own life has been vastly different ive my experience has been a lot of crying now although that can help you come at times its not what you want its not what you want for every day i like the girl who acts like shes enjoying it like you know when your girlfriends like im gonna act like i enjoy it she does that whole yeah oh no thats goodahhim having a good timeand then theyre always going are you done are you close ',\n",
       "  'to done you never fuck a pussy and they go are you almost done finish this like that if youre fucking ass they dont want you they want it all over quick and they do other things the porn girls i dont know how much they get paid im sure its more than what the men get paid its the opposite bit of society um but they do a thing called atm i dont know if you know what that is kids that stands for ass to mouth thats where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus and shell put it directly in her mouth and shell say something like i love the taste of my ass let me taste my ass and then the man as a favor to this woman puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine workshes been doing now i had a drunken night with my exgirlfriend where she thought shed be all wild and try that once again vastly different experience im not a big fan of the ass fucking and i dont know of any man if theyre truthful really is now theres women in the room who are thinking well why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my asswhat a good questionwomen the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because we know you fucking hate it so im a father um i love my son i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes i like to hold him for five minutes every hour and the rest of the time im thinking about how hes fucking killing me hes a good little boy no hes a great little fella i really like him um my girlfriend super loves him though its fucking creepy and im glad i have a son that worked out good for me i wouldnt be a good father to a girl it wouldnt be good for me nothing weird wouldnt fuck it i i just dont get along with women you know how it is i dont want them in my house and so because you dream see for example okay when hank was born the couple over the road within two weeks of hank being born had a baby girl and rightly or wrongly the first thing that went through my head was aw thats great i hope hank fucks that one day thats what i think cause thats what i think about my son i hope when hes of age he just fucks everything i dont care if my son is gay or straight all i care about is when he is of age that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires that is my dream for my sonbut never in the history of fathers and daughters has a father held his baby girl and gone oh i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life i hope youre never shy of a cock i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up right you know and its not just me women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning i go there very occasionally and when you go to the gym theres a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off and inside that daycare theres like three women in theirtheyre very nice ladies and you hand your kid off and he plays then when you finish your workout you come and get him and theres a woman that works there who just loves my son she sees all the other kids but she loves hank and hank fucking loves her and the two of them light up when they see each other and its super cute i bring hank up the stairs and he starts going uh uh trying to reach at her all right and she does this she goes everyone my boyfriends here heres my boyfriend give him here hes my boyfriend and then she kisses him and she goesmy boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kissesits fucking adorable but i tried doing that with a baby girl lets say you go to the gym and theres a daycare and me and a couple of my mates are working there hey everyone me girlfriends here give her here give her here shes my girlfriend my girlfriend gives me kisses you know that right shes always giving me kisses enjoy your workout dont worry about a thing so also its just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter its just little things even when theyre babies its just easier theres a wiping technique when youre wiping a babys ass i dont know if you have children but this is how you do it the baby lays on its back you put their feet together you lift the feet up and then you go in and wipe with a boy you can wipe like that up and down side to side whatever the fuck you want right with a girl you gotta wipe downward and away downward and away its very important that you wipe away from the cunt very important cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts they do they fucking hate it boys dont give a shit fucking my son will have shit all over his dick and balls and ill be cleaning it off under the foreskin and hell be laughing like its the best day ever even at my age now i find it funny if i have shit on my dick if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass i pull out ive got shit on my dick ill ring me mate jason up and go hey jason its happened again i got shit on my dick and hell tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick and well laugh and laugh and laugh but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and shes thought oh i cant wait to call karen when you when my girlfriend got pregnant when you meet when you havent got a child couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children whenever you meet couples with children theyre always like it is the most fulfilling thing ive ever done with my life my heart grows larger and larger every day and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant those same people wen',\n",
       "  't like this youre never gonna sleep againforget about it its over youre not gonna sleep theyre constantly telling you youre not gonna sleep raising a baby is not that hard ill tell you what its easier than a coke habit i had a coke habit for sevenandahalf fucking years at least its not me who wakes up crying anymore i can sleep through other people crying ive had girlfriends thats like white noise to me i find it soothing see me and my girlfriend just two months we went fuck it lets have a kid fucking did it right these other people man you know these couples and they date from high school and then they go out for a bit longer and then after being together for like seven years they go were getting engaged you wanna come to the party and you wanna say no youre really boring and we hate you but you go oh okay great youre still together are you you fucked one person have you oh how exciting and and then what they do is they dont have a kid right away because theyre still not ready we have to see how our careers are going and shit and what they do is they get a dog and then they act like the fucking dogs their baby they refer to it as their fucking baby they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog and it says from our family to yours and then you have a barbecue and you invite them the humans right then they come over this fucking dog runs in jumping over everything and youre like what the fuck is this shit and theyre like we had to bring him we bring our baby everywhere and you go well your baby is biting my actual baby can you control and then eventually they decide theyre gonna have a kid cause theyve learned so much from the dog and then they bring the kid back and the dog runs up like whats happening a new person and theyre like fuck off we dont love you anymore were going and they think theyve learnt something from the dog and they havent learnt anything what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the dog dies you go off you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog try to pass it off as the same dog what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the baby dies very hard to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easier if youre black or asianboston no no no shut up i will not put up with racism at my shows okay im not saying cause they look the same im saying cause theyre easier to purchase if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything it is that you can buy black and asian people im yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child going yolanda quick get hans bring him over come on im gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit uh gun control now no wait before you dont get excited because the other people have guns the antigun people are like yeah do it jim no lets justnow before i start saying this i wanna say this right i believe in your right as americans to have guns im not trying to stop you from having guns all im saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the oh it doesnt matter i dont like guns right im gonna say some things that are just facts right in australia we had guns right right up untilinaustralia had the biggest massacre on earth it still hasnt been beaten and now after that they banned the guns now in theyears before port arthur there wasmassacres since the gun ban inthere hasnt been a single massacre since i dont know how or why this happened uh maybe it was a coincidence right now please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people right i get it in australia we had the biggest massacre on earth and the australian government went thats it no more guns and we all went yeah all right then that seems fair enough really now in america you had the sandy hook massacre where little tiny children died and your government went maybe well get rid of the big guns andof you went fuck you dont take my gunsso heres where it gets confusing right now as i said i am all for your second amendment rights i think you should be able to have guns its in your constitution what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun and this is the argument fuck off i like guns its not the best argument but its all youve got and theres nothing wrong with it theres nothing wrong with saying i like something dont take it away from me but dont give me this other bullshit the main one isi need it for protection i need to protect me i need to protect my family really is that why theyre called assault rifles is it ive never heard of these fucking protection rifles you speak of protection what the fuck are you talking about you have a gun in your house youremore likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think well thatd never happen to me you dont know that because you know what from time to time we all get sad one day youre happy then youre sad and then uhoh protection i had a breakin in manchester england where i was tied up i had my head cut they threatened to rape my girlfriend they came through the window with a machete and a hammer and americans always gowell imagine if you had a gun and im like all right i was naked at the time i wasnt wearing my holster i wasnt staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through what world do you live in where youre constant',\n",
       "  'ly fucking ready you have guns cause you like guns thats why you go to gun conventions thats why you read gun magazines none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security conventions none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going fucking yeah like youre going to be ready if someone comes into your house you have it at all fucking times by the way most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv you think that people are coming to murder your family how many fucking enemies do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyones coming to murder you see if you have it readily available it becomes unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kids picks it up thinks its a toy shoots another one of your kids happens every fucking day but people go thatd never happen in my house cause im a responsible gun owner i keep my guns locked in a safe then theyre no fucking protection someone comes into the house youre like wait there fuckface oh youve come to the wrong house here buddy boy i tell you what im gonna fuck you up okay is itto the left orto the right your mothers birthday why the fuck would i know your fucking mothers birthday maybe if you didnt leave the window openbecause its too hot in here we wouldnt be getting fucking murdered right i find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer is more guns after sandy hook happened the nra said and i quote none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns i i think theyre forgetting what school was like does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to whenever she came into school that relief teacher came you and your friends would see her and gooh were gonna make her cry and then shed stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking and youd go youre never getting married are you miss never gonna happen for you then shed get back to hervolkswagen beetle and shed be crying over the steering wheel just why dont they like me lets give that cunt a gun and see how things work outand then they go oh well answer to that well just add more guns they go well put an armed security guard at every school across america yeah thatll work out the average security guard in america earnsan hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero someone comes onto the school andand youve got kevin now im sure kevins shithot at call of duty but it might not fucking cut it ladies and gentlemen now i understand that when im doing this joke in this roomof you agree with meof you dont agree with me and i do respect the people who dont agree with me dont think i dont out of thethat dont agree with meof those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and its not to be taken seriously and theyre laughing along cause its just funny jokes right and then the nexthave sort of phased out a little bit theyre looking around going wonder how they got that chandelier up there and then theres the lastand theyre fucking furious right now in this room and the people watching at homeof you are fucking seething just and for a couple of reasons first reason im making good pointssecond reason second reason second reason and this is the big one im foreign and thats pissing the fuck out of you right now and your brain is on a loop and you cant fucking turn it off and its just going around in a circle and youre just going if you dont like it go home if you dont like it go home and my answer to that is no i came here legally i pay my taxes ill say whatever the fuck i want your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks and unless youre an american indian youre a fucking immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it i understand that to americans your constitution is very important i respect it but please understand that every country has one as well its no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia i dont know what it says ive never seen it if theres a problem well check it but everythings going fine and dont get me wrong i get that the constitution is important to you i have had fucking i get it right ive had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as im leaving the theater goingyou cannot change the second amendment and im like yes you can its called an amendment if you cant change something thats called an amendment see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you dont know what a thesaurus is get a dictionary and work your way forward dont think your constitution is set in stone youve changed things before you used to have prohibition in there right and then people were like hey who likes getting fucked up yeah i like getting fucked up too lets get that one out lets get that one out you used to have this other thing in america called uh slavery and then lincoln came along and went thats it no more slaves andof you went fuck you dont take my slaves and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns why should i have my slaves taken off me im a responsible slave owner im trained in how to use my slaves safely just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesnt mean that my rights should be taken away from me i i use my slaves to protect my family i keep my slaves locked in a safe thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me ive done nothing w',\n",
       "  'rong look i agree with you if youre a responsible gun owner and you dont fuck around with them then you should be allowed your guns you really should but thats not how society works we have to play to the 1 that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving right i take drugs like a fucking champion rightwe should all be allowed to take fucking drugs but we cant can we because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids oh oh thanks sarah you fucked it up for everyone right everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we cant because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family thanks jonathan now i have to drive atyou fucking idiot see thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me im responsible just because that guys crazy whos to say youre not crazy thats the thing about crazy people they dont know theyre crazy thats what makes them crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth is i think therefore i am you know that you exist anything past that is open to interpretation right you know you exist and thats it right now i think im in boston talking topeople thats what i think im doing but there is a good to fair chance that im in a mental home standing in front of a white wall goingi hate guns i hate guns i hate gunssee one of the better arguments is well if you take the guns away then only the criminals will have guns not true when they banned the guns in australia it worked when they banned them in britain it worked okay the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs likeamerican and you can buy it in walmart itll be delivered to your house thats it manbucks right that same gun in australia on the black market costsnow if you haveyou dont need to be a criminal youve gotyoure a great little saver keep going so that covers the criminals but that doesnt cover the people who wanna murder your family that are coming after you and your family it kind of does the people who do the massacres it covers them cause they go the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker lets say that he had some social issues the kid at sandy hook was aspergers as fuck right i dont know if you know a lot about the black market but you cant just rock up at the docks goingguns who wants to sell me a gun now im gonna wrap this up we wont talk about it anymore now see the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms i really agree with that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government became a bunch of cunts you could all get your guns and fight back and thats why it was written –– yeah and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets but you do know the government has drones right you get that youre bringing guns to a drone fight if we went back to muskets im all for it keep the second amendment if we all have muskets muskets are awesome every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times you know whats good about the musket it gives you a lot of time to calm down someone calls your wife fat and youre like fuck you buddy ah youre not a bad guy youre all rightnow after the show were gonna go out have a big party around boston see how it goes im not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore my girlfriend has said thats a no cause i dont behave myself in there so im not allowed to go to them anymore cause strip clubs arent what women think they areit used to be like okay so when a man goes to a strip club its all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible thats what men want to see women when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are women wanna see a guy hey ladies hes a fireman and he comes out with his hose and like that and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off theyve still got the firemans hat on or a tool belt on or policemans gun on a holster right because even when a mans naked a woman wants to know that he has a job when men watch strippers we want them to have a job and that jobs stripping we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money and just go you cant take care of your kids its and when men get private dances in these strip clubs i dont know i dont know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms but basically its dry humping theres no dancing the girl gets in front she gets where your cock is pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face and you go thats what a private dance is right i dont know if theres private dancing in female strip clubsi cant imagine that there would be i dont imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going she goes how was it and she goes well he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead i got to go to the atmso legit got canceledyeah i know i know it who wouldve thought it wouldve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about the first season is on netflix this special is being recorded for netflix so you can go watch it there if youre watching the special it was im very proud of it we had two great seasons of really good television and if people didnt now the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a ',\n",
       "  'friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel which is a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who in the end we used dj qualls and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip hes the skinny white guy out of the movie hustleflow and hes the white guy out of the movie hustleflow now the great thing about dj is he already looks disabled he has that latter stages of aids thing going on its great for casting anyway but i didnt want dj to begin with i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actors union of america said you cannot do that because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy i think are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired and i said all right what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer and they sent me a list and on this list i said can you get rid of all the contagious ones and what have we got left so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood and ill be honest with you not that many of them i dont know why maybe theyre just lazy they dont wanna work maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly and none of them were very good either everyone we saw none of them were very good cause acting is all about what you do with your hands none of them knew what to do with their hands and they all came in until this one guy came in i had seen a lot of people that day this guy was the most disabled person id ever seen in my life he was like think of the most disabled person youve seen then double it really super disabled he was shaped like a pretzel he was being carried in by this big russian nurse carried him in he made that great disabled sound ofthat one i just loved him anyway so he comes in for the audition and im sitting there and were doing the lines together and at first i didnt know if he was mentally all there either so i was being a little bit patronizing i was going thank you so much for coming in and then we did the dialog together and i didnt have to worry about a thing this kid was funny he was smart his timing was impeccable i thought he was just great and i helped him out of the room and i come back to the director and i said thats our guy thats who we gotta pick and he agreed but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheels himself in now obviously hes just a paraplegic if hes wheeling himself in which means the waist down and that didnt really suit me because paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but i thought if hes a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role so he comes in he comes in i shake his hand and his leg slightly comes out at the same time and i went whoa whats going on there kicky and he goes oh you got me im not disabled and i said youre fucking what now and he goes im not disabled i just really wanted the role so i rented a wheelchair and i said just shut up so let me this is how your day has mappedout thus far you woke up this morning you drove to the wheelchair rental place you rented a wheelchair you carried it out i assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drove here you got the wheelchair out you carried it up three flights of stairs you went to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sat in it and practiced your lines and he went yeah and i said youre a fucking asshole mate get the fuck out of here and i kicked him out and later on that day im sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors im gonna call to tell them theyve got parts and im holding this disabled guys headshot and i just think im gonna call this guy up im gonna change his life this is an awesome moment right and im looking at it and he looks super handsome in his headshot he looked really like and i thought this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history the shutter on his camera has gotta be likelikeand then i read the guys biography and then it dawned on me this guys not disabled either i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair this cunt rented a nurse do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse im all for a method actor get into character three hours before but once you finish the audition stand up and go tada and we would have gone that was very good but ill tell you what you dont do dont make me carry you to your car i carried him down three flights of stairs going you did very good hes like thank you jimi was uh i go to a therapist cause i get depressed so i got a therapist every now and again i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like im gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind like just out of the movies right and she went red and i went blue and then she went cooking and i went food and all that type of stuff we went like this forever and then she went for the last question she went and whats your favorite thing in the world and i went coming on a girls face now now i couldve said things like ice cream is a good answer hank wouldve been an excellent answer but i said coming on a girls face and ive had six months to think about my answer and i stand by it – i –im not proud of it i hate myself for thinking it its such a horrible thing to do to another human when a girls on her knees and you its so ',\n",

hes been training for this his entire lifei think ive uh i think ive become american more american than i am australian lately and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went oh i think like an american person now and im happy to do it i just ill tell you what happened i was flying around i was doing a tour of australia and i was flying domestically around australia and im so used to airports and stuff here in america that okay what happens is when you go i was flying sydney to melbourne when you fly domestically in australia you go up to the machine put your name in prints your ticket out it prints your bag thing you put the bag thing on your bag yourself and then theres a conveyor belt underneath you throw your bag on bag fucks off you dont speak to anyone then i go up to the gate bit and the ladys going tickets please and im holding my id out like a fucking simpleton cause i get through airports quick man im like fucking there you go and she went put your id away i dont need to see that and i went i think you do and she went i dont why would i need to see your id and i said i might be a terrorist and she went would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up no id probably still blow the plane up so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing and im so good at the airports im already taking my shoes off as im walking right and all the australians behind me assume that im american and theyre losing their fucking shit theyre like oh for fucks sake one of these cunts eh and the tsa guy goes hey mate what are you taking your shoes off for and i wenti dont know maybe theyre bombs and he went but theyre not are they i put me shoes back on i get my laptop out everyones going mental and the tsa guy says very politely but extraordinarily sarcastically he goes jeez mate thats a nice computer why are you showing it to everyone it might also be a bomb and then the guy said the most australian thing ive ever heard come out of anyones mouth ever he went oh come on mate you wouldnt have two bombs im not even quite sure what that means but it does make some type of senseall right oscar pistorius if you havent been following the case youre missing out this is the greatest thing since oj simpson youre fucking missing out mate if you dont know who oscar pistorius is let me fill you in oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa known as the blade runner he ran in two olympics the disabled and the ablebodied olympics in one year no one has ever done that hes an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and ablebodied people alike and on valentines day last year he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth and thats when he became an inspir',\n",
       "  'ation to me cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there you cant just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking wantpeople have feelings you cunts now theres a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day one of the theories is that they found in her phone he went through her phone and on her phone he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentines day right now i dont know if youve ever been to south africa but in south africa rugby is more popular than legless running it goes rugby legless running cricket legless runnings their second sport you wouldnt have thought that anyway im going to reenact what i believe happened that day to do that i will now be doing a south african accent now i know many of you cant tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent heres the difference picture my accent but im punching a black person what im trying to say is south africans are horrible people so shes coming out of the shower shes been drying her hair shes listening to rodriguez or something she comes out hes laying on the bed he looks up at her hes holding the phone and he goeswhat the fuck is this ive been through your phone you have been texting a rugby player and shes like oh fuck you who the fuck do you think you are who am i im oscar pistorius the greatest legless runner that has ever been thats who the fuck i am well i would rather be with a rugby player at least he is a whole man not a threequarter man like you –– i knowoh fuck you no fuck you im leaving you and then she storms out of the room and then he was like you fucking bitchi hate youyou will rue the day that you left oscar pistorius the blade runner dont go anywherei hate you thats where he keeps his legs all right then he put the blades on oh youre in trouble missy i tell you i go to my gun safe she locked herself in the bathroom he shot her through the bathroom door seems like overkill doesnt it bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them but oscars one of the few men on earth that couldnt kick the door in right he was wearing the blades so boing ah so i think oscar will probably go to prison now in south africa one in four people have aids i assume it may even be worse in the prison population now can i say this look ive never raped a man i hate that i have to put a man in that sentence but whatever ive never raped a man but if i was going to rape a man it would be a legless olympian cause in prison its all about getting one up on other people and making people think youre tough and all that like you want to fucking rape me i just raped an olympian bitch is that what you fucking want thered be a wonderful moment when youre in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movieyou know what i like about that joke so often when you tell a joke the rapist is the villain in the story but not in that one not in that one hes the heroall right we have to get going soon before i leave – i thank you very much for coming –no i said soon not over its just soon you cunts so calm down i always i always find that weird when someone like whistles like that what do they think is going to happen like im going to go fucking you know me mate i was enjoying claps and cheers but what i needed was a highpitched squeal noise thank god you came along to pick up my spiritslove you all right final story now i was in south africa again jeez i dont think ill be working in south africa

africa and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles which is like a our flight youve to go up to london and go across cunt of a trip um but it was all right cause i had a business class ticket so i didnt give a fuck and when i travel economy i try to dress up nice cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade but when ive already got a business class ticket i try to look like a bag of shit cause its important to me that everyone else in business class doesnt want me there and theyre annoyed by my presence so im wearing a white tshirt thats got brown stains on it with a hole in the side im wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out so anyway i go up to the counter up to the business thing with the thing and i go hello and

people and they want you to swear cause as soon as you swear they dont have to engage with you anymore they can act like theyre the first adult never to hear a swear word and they can get really offended right so i went are you fucking kidding me and she went please do not speak to me that way i have done nothing wrong and i said are you a white south african telling me youve done nothing

men in the group were like hey why dont you shut the fuck up just shut the fuck upit doesnt matter these people seem very angry soand a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down and sometimes americans sometimes you can seem a little insincere and he came up and he wenthey hey yeah i get itdowngraded yeah that really grinds my gears i tell you that yeah i would write a stronglyworded letter i really would and then i thought at least this guys being nice and i said look mate dont worry about it its not like its your fault and i said why are you in such a big group

btch put your phone down motherfckers they cant use their eyes everybodys gotta live through their goddamn phone whoo im high as fck whoo its strange i wasnt sure if i was gonna do this sober im like ugh its not the move not in san francisco this is i love pot but the people that are making edibles need to slow the fck down oh my god what are you trying to do to peoplei had a pot gummy bear the other day i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldnt be able to steal your soul right how the fck are these people making these things man theyre not consistent thats also part of the problem you dont know what youre getting cause theyre not making them the same place where they make tylenol nah its some greasy dude with a grateful dead tshirt on and a gray ponytail hes got a bowl of ingredients and he cant remember whether or not he put weed in yet this dudes time traveling just back and forth he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings you eat it and its not what youre looking for its not regulated you gotta ask questions i asked a dude at the pot store i go hey man how strong are the gummy bears he goes thats not a unit of measurement hes like el diablo el diablo fck man how much should i take just the leg just the leg why are you selling whole bears what the fck are you trying to prove man they just watch you leave with that bear they go oh shit they know they know youre not gonna die youre gonna think youre gonna die but everybody lives learn some shitwe learn some shit from the scary trips see the thing about edibles one of the problems with it being illegal is that a lot of us dont have a lot of information that we could use like theres a difference between smoking it and eating it when you smoke it you get thc but when you eat it its processed by your liver and it produces something called ydroxy metabolite thats five times more psychoactive than thc and it lets you talk to dolphinsthis is a real moment that changed my life i was in hawaii and we were on a boat and we were fishing we were pulling these lines behind the boat and i was so high i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning like the boats going this way and the suns up there im like um for likeminutes im paralyzed so while this is all happening these dolphins just show up and if youve ever been around wild dolphins theyre very trippy its very different than you expect because they look at you they like check you out they like pop out of the water and they like look at you like a person not like a fcking deer or woodchuck they look at you like another person granted i was so high i thought i was gonna die but im making eye contact with these dolphins and i started thinking how smart are these fcking things because were fishing dolphins eat fish but you never catch dolphins ever no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin and all i could think of while these dolphins were like hopping through the water and looking at us and shit i was thinking if people lived in the water youd fcking catch em all day they wouldnt even have to live in the water if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street at least once a week a guy would be like im taking a chance and you see em getting yanked up to the clouds fck we lost billy the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloudyou dont catch dolphins on fishhooks man thats weird theyre around fishing all the time and like btch theyre fcking smart how smart well i watched a dolphin documentary and it said they have a cerebral cortex thatslarger than a human beings i dont know what that means but if you say it right and dont fck up the words it makes you sound smarter than you really are i think what it means is they have big fcking brains but we dont think of them as being smart cause they dont do what we do right they dont send emails they dont have houses but if you lived in their world you dont need anything you dont need your fingers no ones typing they have a language thats so complex we cant understand it all the foods free they stay where the waters warm i started thinking how fcking smart are they what if theyre exactly the same as us what if its just some different branch of evolution we went one way they went the other what if consciousness is the same i was thinking what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin the way you think of yourself when you say the word me i was like what if thats exactly how a dolphin feels theyre just living life through different biology different genetics different life experiences but if i lived a dolphins life i would be him and if he lived my life he would be me and then i started thinking what if thats the case with peop',\n",

i thought god damn how good is this weed im getting in california whoo im on a fcking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean talking to water people the problem with treating everybody as if

mark cuban no we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in thewe got an old man who hates money and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair you cant have a president with environmental concerns when every time this motherfcker does his hair we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames hes got like a closet full of aqua net at home you cant pretend you dont give a fck when you have that thing going on dude stop thatthe white house got broken into while obama was in office the first time in overyears that someone broke into the white house also the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself what are you trying to say that women cant do everything men can do exactly thats exactly what im saying that seems sexist right people say youre sexist no its not sexist heres why its not sexist cause men cant even do everything men can do see theres no physical equality folks thats why we have the olympics cause theres people that can do some shit that you and i cant do one of those things is guarding the fcking white house i know i cant guard the white house you know how i know because ive met shaquille oneal and his dick is where my face is thats not equality thats not white privilege listen if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack im the wrong dude to save the world i did fear factor with shaq if were holding hands itd be like a sixyearold at the park with his dad were barely the same thing so do i think women should guard the white house no i dont think i should either its not sexist to say that women cant do big physical labor things as good as giant men can but people will tell you it iswell im not sexist as a matter of fact my favorite people are all female i have a wife and i have three daughters theyre my favorite people in the world but i could beat the fck out of all of them okay listen if theyre guarding the door im getting in i dont mean to sound cocky but im just real confident i could fck them up if i had the flu okay yeah were different were different i could beat up my cat too im not proud of it i just tell you whats up if you wanna bet money bet money on me ill fck that cat up most likely cats are fcking weird like that man i was petting my cat once and he bit me i was like whoa are we gonna do this what the fck are you doing here i got a little nervous got a little nervous women can do everything men can do this guys a piece of shit were leaving too much information is going in that i dont agree with what the guy said was total bullshit total bullshithowd that girl get that job ill tell you how that girl got that job because someone let her have that job which means either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her or her boss was a chick and she hated her either ones possible look if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her that makes total sense ',\n",
       "  'if theres one hot girl and shes working with five guys in an office no works getting done in that office that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to fck her each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole theres gotta be a fcking way theres gotta be a fcking way you got this girl whos like i could guard the front door oh you could definitely guard the door no doubt no doubt and over time if this woman doesnt sleep with one of these men and claim him over time these guys will just start morphing and theyll just start saying ridiculous preposterous shit debbie wants to guard the front door do you have a problem with that no i dont as a matter of fact i think women are amazing plus im vegan and they will just they will wear patchouli they will do what the fck they have to do next thing you know poor fcking debbie at the front door why am i alone the whole story is so bananas and its one of my favorite stories so im gonna give you the whole story of the breakin at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations this is the real story cause a lot of people think theres some grand conspiracy theres some cabal of evil geniuses thats pulling the strings on everyone in america its most likely that people are just dumb as fck in all sorts of walks of life this is the story this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house first of all people are always worried the governments checking out my emails bro the governments watching us all the time they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house he had four handguns two rifles and a machete with him they didnt even watch him he had a map on the map was washington and it had an x where the white house is theyre like youre good to go they let him go two months later this motherfcker broke into the white house and why did he break into the white house why do you break into the white house ever because you want to die you dont thats like a suicide run thats the only reason why someone runs toward the white house if you had to ask someone what kind of security do you think they have at the white house oh dude they got snipers on every corner they got lasers in the grass if you get too far they open up a door you drop right into jail nope turns out they dont even have a dog you just fcking run the guy who made it into the white house he hadrounds of ammunition in his car left that there took a knife thats a guy who wants to die hes just sitting in his fcking car going fck the government fck my exwife and fck everybody im gonna do this fck you just sprinting oh my god im doing it oh my god im doing it thinking with every step this is gonna be the last step of my life no this is gonna be the last step of my life no this and he gets to the front door its unlocked he opens it theres a girl there by herself smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall ah hes probably going why am i alive hes probably thinking he was inside for minutes for minutes running around he got tackled by an offduty officer he was probably thinking i wanted to die i dont want to go to fcking jail will somebody please shoot me then he was probably pissed where are my tax dollars going what kind of security are you fcking people running in this place imagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him he was probably like everybody everybody not that much diversity i mean what are you playing fcking fairy tale games hereobamas got a hard job cause hes the first president thats ever been around while google was here you know he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night right so let me see what the people have to say hed just go obama is aim none of those fcking things freakin out shitprobably thinking why the fck did i do this i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common in that they went for it but they probably never really thought they were getting in there you cant quit once youre the president the moment obama actually got into office like good morning mr president he was probably like oh no what the fck did i do this for i didnt think i was actually gonna get ini cant sleep im freaking out everybody wants to kill mewho the fck is guarding me looks out in the hallway theres a girl taking selfies thatd be the greatest selfie of all time a girl with her ass out duck lips in the background a dudes breaking into the white house you know im not making this up youve all seen this this is recognizable pigeontoed is a good move cause you cant get away that good you just like like theres something wrong with your back thats a recognizable pose when did that start cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures everybody just stood there looking hungry like if you saw a photo from theand in the background a girl was going shes a fcking time traveler nobody knew that move back then somebody had to see',\n",
       "  ' their face oh people like that they like what im doing combo a twohole combo attractor its all over online it gets you a lot of likesi saw a gal on instagram she has eight million

like she doesnt have an occupation that they follow theyre just staring at her ass this is a new kind of human theres never been a person psychologically thats had to navigate those kind of waters if you really stop and think about it science should really step in and start looking at this dont go to south america to study some new frog that nobody gives a fck about theres a girl in florida with eight million people staring at her ass how does this girl keep a relationship what is her day like how many dick pics does she get sent how many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis is it like the national debt counter was just fcking spinning out of control constantly i bet if she turns on the notifications her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her i bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone it would be physically lighter this is a new kind of person we really have to understand theres never been a person like this before and shes just a person like that kind of influence that kind of attractant thats a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl and as a guy who has daughters i just think of that like thats kind of fcking thats weird because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her i mean i follow her but im not like those other assholes im different i care i care about who she is im a nice person im a hero or somethingim different those other guys are assholes men are noble men are noble and true mmm if we get to come if men dont get to come we get real

mission to mars a manned mission to mars wherepeople have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on mars theyre gonna take a oneway trip to mars thats some sad shit for a bunch of reasons first of all its some sad shit cause thatspeople that dont have any real friends right if its someone you love your real friend if one of my friends is gonna move to florida ill be like btch where the fck are you going youre gonna go to florida we cant hang out if you go to florida why the fck are you moving to florida man but you might be able to deal with it we can just visit each other every now and then but if your friend was gonna move to mars youd be like oh really get in the fcking car just get in the car dude take him out to death valley look around sucks right mars sucks worse get back in the car stupid jesus christ theres places in america you cant live man you dont wanna live in detroit why the fck are you talking about moving to mars people really consider moving to mars its one of the dumbest ideas ever but if you say that people will ecobro you have you ever been ecobroed these people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you as michael shermer likes to point out like puff their chest out and say that theyre probably better than you hey dude seriously you think theres something wrong with going to mars well i dont know if youve paid attention man we maybe should colonize mars cause californias almost out of water then hell nod like yeah btch were right next to the ocean what the fck are you talking about look at all that water you fly over it it takes a day the worlds blue its more water than it is not water we have a salt problem we dont have a water problem suck the salt out of the water we got a goddamn party instead of pissing and moaning too complicated bro we gotta go to neptune oh my god youre fcking crazy were a crazy race filled with crazy people were like a dude with a dirty house like man i gotta build a new house no you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen stop piling up newspapers youre never gonna read in front of your bathroom you fck were crazy oneway trip to mars a oneway trip in coach with three other people so fcking stupid theyre willing to die on mars with you great what great conversation youre gonna have its nonsense folks my friend was like theyre not gonna die on mars man if people are smart enough to figure out how to get to mars theyre smart enough to figure out how to get back heres why that doesnt make any sense people smart enough to get to ',\n",
       "  'mars arent going see thats the dirty secret about rocket travel ladies and gentlemen nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those fcking things no no they look at each other right before the launch and they go they talk german and they get behind giant fcking concrete bunkers they take some squarejawed cornfed dude from the middle of the country tuck a bible under that dudes arm and strap him into that giant metal dick and shoot it off into the heavens thats what we do and that is what that is that is a metal dick its a robot dick and were trying to fck the sky we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant and theyre too filled up with people and then they gotta make a new metal dick bro we gotta go to jupiter then they make another one they shoot that fcking thing and they fill jupiter up we just keep filling the cosmos up with people and we never evolve and we never change we stay perfect like we are right now whos in youre gonna all come with me were gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street and its all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy iti watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times i went clear i think i think im clear im back im back now if you havent seeni had to watch going clear a scientology documentary cause i have a neighbor whos a scientologist and i dont even think hes gay i dont know what the fcks going onbut he sleeps really close to me you know like my beds here this fcking dudes beds like over there his house is i mean if you take away the walls hes fcking right there its like what does this crazy fck believe and scientology is a wonderful religion not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone thats ever walked the face of the earth and not by a small amount this dude never made a second draft in his fcking life everything was one draft of nonsense and he wrote more of it than anybody not in his neighborhood not in his state not in a year not in a decade more than anyone thats ever lived ever and scientology is still like i dont see any red flags i think were good i think this is legit as fck if scientology is a good religion its because other religions get to make fun of em its like its the one religion that even the mormons are like btch you believe what hold on i mean at least we dont have video of joseph smith theres some fcking shitty black and white footage of l ron hubbard with a captains outfit on you wanna explain thatwhy does he have all those awards on why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate what the fck is going on with you people i watched it with my mom and it was like first of all scientology they dont pay taxes thats disturbing theyre taxfree which means theyre a recognized religion by the government of the united states which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went everything seems in order none of this shit seems like a cult well what the fck is a cult and whats a religion so i had to look it up turns out i dont know who wrote this but its a perfect definition a cult is bullshit its created by one person that person knows its bullshit in a religion that dudes dead so its a religion cause l ron hubbards dead so i guess they got it on a loophole i watched it with my mom and my mom was like i cant believe anybody would fall for that you made me go to catholic school the fck are you talking about there was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne and you made me call him father slow your roll lady imagine if i talked to my mom like thatoh my god jokes folks just jokes i dont have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too openended its too confusing and i think were evolving and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions we wanna seek these answers but in the meanwhile they just give you so much anxiety and it fcks with you so much theres nothing wrong with joining a cult i think you gotta just join a nice friendly one like the mormons are a good cult heres why they dont get mad at anybody like they never kill anybody like heres a perfect example matt stone and trey parker the guys who created south park they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon its fantastic if you havent seen it its so fcking hilarious but its also brutal brutal about the mormons you know what the mormons did they went to see it and they took out a fullpage ad in the playbill it said if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon please visit our website they just took it right on the chin like champs they didnt get mad they didnt get defensive they didnt kill anybody thats a good cult they just said what do you wanna do we got nine wives shut the fck up everybody just everybody just chill just chill thats a good religion ',\n",
       "  'thats a good cultsome cults arent that good they get fcking testy you know the one we dont have to say who you know what im talking about theres that one that will kill you if you draw their guy come on man i cant even draw your dude what if i draw a dude drawing your dude no loopholes fckin relax bro and this isnt just theoretical people have died cause they made cartoons before the most recent paris attacks there was a magazine called charlie hebdo and they were attacked wherecartoonists were killed eleven more were wounded and they killed a cop too fcking crazy over cartoons and when you when theres radical crazy people in the world whats interesting is the reaction to radical crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weirdbecause when these people got killed over a cartoon the whole world was in shock the whole world was outraged but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures you couldnt see em in the la times you couldnt find them in time magazine you had to go online and find them it was a dark moment for free speech because everybodys like oh i dont wanna get killed i dont wanna show the pictures it was weird until the balance because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures word got back to texas where they promptly held a draw muhammad contest in garland texas im not making a word of this up you can google it and ill wait they had a draw muhammad contest in garland texas two dudes showed up started shooting at the building they were killed almost instantly why because they were at a draw muhammad contest in texas how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious what are you livin in a wile e coyote cartoon motherfcker you ever go to texas thats not santa monica btch thats a totally different kind of white people those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns theyre not supposed to be there people didnt evolve in texas its not like they were monkeys then they became people and they stayed in that spot no no they landed on boats on the east coast the stubborn ones stayed the smart ones made it to california but along the way we lost a bunch of peopleand some of them just stuck around yall go ahead were gonna hang back here im gonna draw the biggest dick the worlds ever seen in the sand my wifes got the biggest titties imma try to fck a snake i think it can be done they just stayed they just gathered cattle stockpiled ammo and they all talk alikeand thats why you gotta be nervous you gotta be nervous in places with accents okay its one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live cause all the spots that suck they all have to sound like each other cause i grew up in a place like that i grew up in boston its not that the people in boston suck but the weather sucks its fcking horrible and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning and just goes fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck and everybodys worried about its a real possibility you might starve to death one day you might freeze trying to walk homeso they all talk in the same way oh my god how many more months till summer ahhh when is this fcking winter gonna be over we need more firewoodthey have to sound like the people around them so if other people invade like we stick together were all in this togetherthats how they are in texas too theyre like yall aint from around here are ya they have a fcking certain way of talking which is proof positive why california is the best spot try making fun of a california accent what are you gonna do speak clear and concise what are you gonna do you gonna mock us youre gonna say some shit that everybody understands theyre not supposed to be in texas folks its not even a state its a republic they were like man we aint so sure about this whole united states thing were gonna hang back hang back see how this plays out they dont have any rules they have like three pages of rule books heres how i know this im gonna tell you a fact a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas there are more tigers in captivity in texas in private collections than there are in all of the wild of the world im gonna repeat it because i know youre like oh the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work no theres more tigers in dudes yards in texas than the rest of the fcking planet how is that possible because they can because they went through the rule bookit dont say shit about tigers order it up dude order it up dude one guy got a tiger and his neighbors like shit i didnt know we could get tigers and he got two tigers and the first guy was like i aint about to let this faggot outtiger me and he opened up tiger world with his oil money were gonna need those people folks if the russians invade we cant make fcking warrior babies with those chicks in marin county with fake asses and rubber lips okay were gonna need some real warrior genes were gonna need some women who wear nonironic daisy dukes they got co',\n",
       "  'wboy boots with no socks and stinky feet and they yell out chris kyle rest in peace when you make em come we need those women if the russians come we gotta be ready think about the children think about the children while i get a sip this is super important ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are sleeping onimagine if i had real points oh jesus christi love you fckers too man so excited to be here i have kids and i lie to them i get high around em too people say you shouldnt do that but they dont see it they say you shouldnt be intoxicated around your children well im not im high i call it elevated its a different thing the people who have a problem with that they dont understand what getting high is like they think youre gonna be to your kid like who are you what do you think whats the worst thing that can happen if im a little high around my kid theyre gonna get extra hugs and daddys going to be paranoid about objects look out dont go there thats it plus i have cool conversations i have a sixyearold daughter man theres not a lot of earold man and earold girl have in common other than the fact shes my daughter and so our conversations are normally pretty boring but when im high im like you know you call that thing your baby your doll you call it your baby but you know its not a baby right yeah i know its not a baby do you call it a baby because youre the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you maybe okay thats cool thats cool give me a hug i love you its weird man its weird raising little people theres some things that i didnt expect one of the things i didnt expect is you have to lie to them like you dont have to lie to them about a lot of things but you have to lie to them about santa claus its just one of those things man cause its like a community you have to think about what your kids gonna tell other kids because when it comes to santa claus you dont want your kid to be one of two things you dont want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit cause that kids an asshole but you dont want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit cause that kids a moron so you got you got a little bit of youre like oh no when do we do this when do we do this and no one knows when to do it you just let the kids figure it out then theyre like dad what the fck youre like aw oh i missed the boat i missed the boat nobody knows when to do it nobody can be honest about it they have little meetings and shit and im like when do we tell em this lady goes when theyretheyre gonna be fcking by then i told her it was funny she didnt believe me im like oh im sorry im off by a year thats not as funny but its i didnt mean it but its this thing they want to keep the kids in the dark and they wanna pretend theyre the only one thats teaching the kid this is a weird thing that people do theyre like i teach my kids man i teach my kids eh when you see em but unless youre some freak who homeschools your children in the forest your kids gonna go to school theyre gonna go to school and theyre gonna be in a class withother kids the teacher only makesbucks a year and shes thinking about dick thats all shes thinking about shes thinking about getting stuffed shes a young fertile woman who loves kids and shes writing on that chalkboard and the kids all huddle up and share information like yeah what did your dad tell you your dad tell you that yeah my dad says santa claus is fcking bullshit okay you ever go near a chimney its that big what the fck teachers coming play with blocks act stupid uh how does this work they play dumb they play dumb theyre like little prisoners trying to figure their way out they make little papiermâché heads and pretend theyre napping theyre little humans they wanna run shit who is these people telling us what to do are they being straight with us man what the fck is going on i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit she came home stared me down she was like maddogging me she took her book bag and just goeswalked right up to the chimney looking at me how the fck dad have you ever met santa claus no honey ive never met him but you let him in the house and theres this moment it was a moment where a sevenyearold has you at checkmate youre like oh shit i dont know whether to highfive her or to keep lying you wanna go yeah you got me you got me you got me thats bullshit no the big bang is real but this is bullshit the big bang sounds even less real the problem is you have to be consistent if youre teaching your kids nonsense you gotta teach em only nonsense you cant mix nonsense in with like real stuff like my daughter will go like how do birds fly i go birds have bones that are hollow so theyre really light then they have feathers which cover a large surface area and they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air see the air looks like its nothing right but its actually a bunch of gases thats why the trees move when the wind blows the birds can manipulate that and go throughspace whoa yeah',\n",
       "  ' nature is crazy yeah how does the fat man get through the little hole magic christmas magic now go to bed im trying to fck your mom go to bed jokes folks just jokes cant talk like that thats how you make strippers you gotta be nice theyre little tiny people theyre adorable they dont know anything yet you gotta teach em everything you cant talk meankids are a lot like really fcking stupid people in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room the most confident one just starts running shit they dont have to have any more information they just have to be more confident if you get a bunch of dummies together theyre like i dont know whats going on i dont know whats going on i fcking do i fcking do the guy doesnt have to have any extra data he just has to be the only one thats confident and thats what its like in schoolmy daughters class has this fcking kid named debbie and every day its debbie says oh fcking debbie says debbie says what you dont think about that before you have kids not only are you gonna have kids but your kids are gonna make friends and then you have to make friends with the fcking parents of your kids and some of em are crazy my daughters like debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world and all people came from them is that trueand this is weird like you dont know what to do right you want to be diplomatic you dont want to cause problems at school but you gotta be honest and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is i dont know im like sweetie i dont know i dont know if adam and eve is where people came from but nobody knows because no one from today is alive back then so its not something you can measure so its not something you can see so we dont know but heres what we do know you know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears yeah well some people have brains that are made out of dog shit and they get horny too and what happens is they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with its like the opposite of evolution and then they have a kid and their kid is fcked their kid is fcked and everybody wants to pretend its a level playing field theres no level anywhere you look is an eagle and a salmon level does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle no the universe does not want even it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement okay im gonna shut this light out and im gonna go fck your mom right in the mouth all right i dont say these things i dont say any of these things i was like i dont know maybe debbies right doesnt make sense to me how would that work how would that work it wouldnt work would it adam and eve are the only two people they have kids and then where do all the other people come from i guess the kids just start fcking each other is that what happens mom fcks the kids or the yeah exactlydebbies parents they were at my house man for a cookout and the dude told me the earthsyears old theyre young earth christians theyre sweet people by the way before i shit on them im gonna shit on them but before i shit on them theyre sweet theyre really nice people i hug em every time i see em theyre really kind nice people but they just found a part of their brain theyre like i have no use for thischucked that whole logic discerningreason part this fcking things confusing theyre young earth christians which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible im like how many people believe the earth is less thanyears old uh i looked it up theres a recent gallup poll that said thatof america believes the earth is less thanyears oldheres why you shouldnt be scared they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls and when you factor that in youre talking about a really small number cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say how olds the earth number one answer is older than your mothers pussy and then they hang up number two answer is fck you after that you start throwing numbers around and onlyof those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth isyears old thats debbies fcking parentsso out of the people that answer polls is it even 1 it might be 1 onlyare that fcking stupid and thats the 1 we should really be worried about were worried about the wrong 1 not that we shouldnt be worried about the really rich greedy people we definitely should we should definitely worry about bankers and people who theyre just stockpiling resources they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else but they dont theyd rather just pile up their goldyeah that 1 is awfulbut theres another 1 that freaks me the fck out that no ones talking about thats the 1 who leave comments on youtube videos who the fck are those freaks could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other i mean if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page the first comment would be you aint shit without your dad pussy these are monsters this is not a normal persons response normal people dont lea',\n",

really this is what everybodys take is this is the take that youre supposed to have hes always been a woman trapped in a mans body maybe definitely maybe definitely people are like that definitely there are people who were born in the wrong gender and am i saying they should stay their gender no who gives a fck you should do whatever you wanna do you should be happy you should be free i dont care what you do but its also possible that maybe if you live with crazy btches long enough you become one thats all im saying i dont see this discussed it is entirely possible if you put a praying mantis on a leaf it becomes the color of the leaf why because it wants to live it wants to survive it wants to be accepted by its environment you show me a man whos lived with the kardashians for ten years who didnt come out a chick and then well have some data okay cause right now we lost a fcking american olympian and i want you to have some respectwere down bruce jenner and ive got a close eye

transphobic and incredibly regressive you should be embarrassed at what youre doing youre doing this just to get laughs at someone elses expense maybe or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons maybe

       "  'he night that sounded dutch right you know what that you know what that expression means it means why would you marry a woman if shes already having sex with you which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore now its like why buy the cow uh maybe because every day the cow asks you when youre gonna buy it andyou live in a really small apartment with the cow so you cant avoid that question at all and also the cow is way better at arguing than you are and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue why buy the cow uh maybe because every time another cow gets bought you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale and your cow looks over at you the entire time like and does not enjoy the sale at all even though shes the one that wanted to go to the sale and shes especially mad because that farmer and cow met like eight months after you guys met why buy the cow well lets be real here youre very lucky to have the cow that you do have roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for john by the most liberal of estimates there have been about eight cows total several unmilked and a lot of people think that you like bulls and if you just bought they assume it when you search your name the third thing to come up is like john mulaney bull and if you just bought the cow nobody would say that anymore theyll still say it cause there are those guys who they buy a cow and then on the side total matador but but for real chicago why buy the cow lets be real why buy the cow because you love her you really do and yeah yeah sure shes a bossy little jew butshe takes care of you and you dont wanna be some old man stumbling around like hey you seen any loose milkmy wife is jewish shes a new york jew i did it now i was raised catholic i dont know if you can tell that from the everything about me my wife is jewish i grew up catholic so we got married by a friend being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families religions while confusing the elderly people at the wedding whats the name of the bishop thats actually standup comedian dan levy he was the host of mtvs your face or mine i saw a lot of catholic weddings though because i was an altar boy and a hush falls over the room isnt it weird how that became a scandalous thing that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends but now its like saying i was a french maid for a period of time i was treated well in my day i worked for a variety of sirs no being an altar boy was just a boring gig you know youd serve mass and then youd serve weddings sometimes my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big packed church in chicago where we grew up and the bride was coming down the aisle and the organ was playing and all the pews were filled and the bride got all the way to the altar and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride and right at that moment the other altar boy said aw shes ugly and then they looked and they were right next to the video camera and i know thats awful but wouldnt you give a million dollars to see that wedding video it was the best moment of this stupid womans life and shes walking down the aisle and the organs like and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god and right at that second for no reason at all some cheetofingered ratmustached earold prick decides to go aw shes ugly hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like aw shes beautiful shes enchantingi grew up catholic i dont go to church anymore but i went on christmas eve with my parents cause you know how you lie to your parents so we go into the church and i was like i got this under control and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit no i was going through mass and i was batting likeand then in the middle of mass the priest said peace be with you and everyone said and with your spirit and i was the oneasshole going and also with you what huh what huh what when when for those of you that arent catholic i dont mean to exclude you even though we love to exclude you but theres a part in church where the priest says peace be with you and for many many years we all said – and also with you – very good but they changed it to and with your spirit because thats what needed revamping in the catholic church that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease in rome they were like lets see what problems can we solve problem one no im actually glad they changed that though i never liked and also with you i always f',\n",

       " ['comedy michelle wolf its great to be here transcript october 1 comedian michelle wolf wryly riffs on nude beaches the gross things men like and the serial killer gender gap in this threepart standup specialpart 1 new neighborhood hi guys how are youits fine i dont really carei always like being here in philadelphiai love being here in denver you guys you know you have a good town always happy to be here in salt lakei love coming to madison i always love being back herethis is gonna be fun were gonna have a good timeive been able to have a very interesting perspective on whats happening in america recently because i havent been living here um ive actually been living in barcelona which is a very lovely place um its a beach city but its also a bit of a gay city i think thats why they have the lisp uh barthelonaits like we get it you have something in your mouth because its a beach city and its a european beach city a lot of the beaches there are clothingoptional which means you end up seeing a lot of penises um and its never the best penises you know first of all women never want to see a penis that they dont want to see even the one we do want to see a lot of times were like can you put that away or like in something okay in me all right fine cause as long as the caps back on the pen you know having a penis out at the beach its definitely not a young mans game this is an old mans game cause the unwritten rule is that you can have your penis out but like it has to stay floppy you know and i imagine thats just harder for younger guys cause theres like boobs and like you know a breeze but these older guys are quite impressive theyre there with their hands on their hips my penis will stay as soft as the sand im standing on a lot of them are bigger guys too theyre a bit older outofshape guys theyve got a bit of a belly i dont think theyve seen their penis in a while i think thats kind of why they do it you know so they can see it reflected in your eyes like i still got it okay good of course theres women there too so theres a lot of boobs out anytime i go to the beach i dont take off my swimsuit because im not trying to get that sunburned and uh but ill go with my friend and she takes off her top and she recently she got breast implants so and i hadnt seen them yet and they were like really they look really good so i was like oh my gosh your fake boobs look amazing and then she got mad at me cause i called them fake boobs and i was like well theyre not real if your friend got breast implants would you call them real nowould you okay good so were all a little transphobicthats a fun social experiment you know if theyre fake on a woman theyre fake on a woman anyway what ii know you all feel like i got you didnt you well i did thats why what im talking about right now though is im describing the regular beach so in barcelona theres a regular beach and theres a gay beach if youre one of those people like why cant the gay beach be the regular beach go to the gay beach youll be like thats not regular and of course theres also penises out at the gay beach but the differences between the penises at the regular beach and the penises at the gay beach are like the difference between a dog parkand a dog show like at the regular beach theyre like were all just having a good time at the gay beach theyre like number five and hes like yes yes of course you know when i say gay beach i mean male gay beach its not a lesbian beach i wanna go to a lesbian beach i wanna go to a beach where theyre like volleyballs atsunscreens over there heres some boots the sands uneven were working on it we teach cpr on mondays we do have taco tuesdays it does mean both things you can eat and then you can eat okay okay so if the regular beach is a dog park and the gay beach is a dog show the lesbian beach is a dog rescue its like youre safe here and also they probably literally rescue dogs i have developed over the last couple years a fascination with lesbians are there any lesbians herehow many gay men are hereits probably about the same number but this is why i like lesbians gay men youre very loudlesbians live in the shadows gay men we always know when gay men are around you guys arent shy at all even at the parade you guys are like above the float dancing all around lesbians are just underneath making sure stuff works theyre like were on the right route its okay yeah lesbians live in the shadows you know lesbians are like bees if you dont bother them they wont bother you but also if they all die the world endsand you do like lesbians do you scare me a little bit im intimidated by lesbians uh youre a bit scary uh i think lesbians are so scary that even aids was like lets stick to less terrifying things like needles and butt holesand lesbians definitely leave their mark on the world its just sometimes a little more subtle like lesbians wore khakis so hard that now when men wear khakis they look like lesbians like any time i see jim harbaugh on the sideline im like go get em coach lesbian like any of you gay',\n",
       "  ' men who are here were any of you like little gay boysyeah you you know the gay boys im talking about weve all seen the little gay boys like the kids at the park that are just like i dont want to play hes like over twerking by the slide his dads trying to throw the ball with him and its like just stop it its not going to catch okay we know little gay boys exist which means little lesbians also exist but you never see a little lesbian because lesbians live in the shadows i want to see a little lesbian you know just a little girl like aggressively eating a muffin she doesnt know why shes doing it shes like i got to practice i got to really get in there and i think women we really fucked up we befriended gay men i dont think that was the right choice i think we shouldve befriended lesbians lesbians would be like come on we found a way to run a successful society instead we befriended gay men and theyre like bitch youre uglyand were like hes my best friend i like him cause hes mean to me in a different way and theres not like not that many prominent lesbians you know even now sometimes youll hear about lesbians like youll find out theyre a lesbian after they died like men will be like oh i thought she was just miserable and alone and its like no she lived with that lady yeah i know i thought they were miserable and alone together cause i think its still hard for straight men to sometimes believe that women can be happy without a man and i think even straight women i think even we know that thats possible and now we have the luxury to decide if we want to get married or not that used to not be the case you used to always have to get married im sure there were some women that like during world war ii their husband went off to fight in the war and then he died and they were like oh no no im too heartbroken i can never marry again this bed is bigand also for the longest time i think straight men they always wanted lesbians to be like two hot young women who would maybe like invite them to join and lesbians were like no thats not who were gonna be there was always at least one lesbian in a couple who looked like she knew how to like build a deck and that made sense to me that couple made sense to me because i knew who was doing the work now there is the emergence of the young hot lesbian couple and it doesnt make any sense to me because i have no idea whos doing any work hot women dont have to work i cant figure it out it just seems like its going to be two women lying in bed waiting for something to happen to them like when theres a burglar whos going down and also whos going down i know the answer for gay men its both of you for both those things youre both going down on each other and youre both going down to the burglar to see if he wants to come up like oh you brought zip ties good we were already playing hostage but my biggest the reason ive been so fascinated with lesbians i think it actually comes from a jealousy im jealous of the lesbian relationship because you get to be a wife but you also get a wife that seems super productive i want to be a wife but i dont i dont get a wife i get a husband and whats he going to do whats he gonna do in this almost equal society we fought so hard for what protect me from who hes the guy most likely to kill meand so the fact is you know the reason i moved to barcelona as a strong independent woman was for a boyand being in love and being happy is the worst thing thats ever happened to me uh i was before this i was always single and i was miserable and it made sense and i knew why now im happy and im in love and its terrifying because it could go away at any point but i actually think this is the key to a successful relationship never feel secureno matter how long youve been in a relationship always think your partner could leave cause then youre never too mean like i treat my guy like an indooroutdoor cat im like you can go but theres good food hereand ive been learning a lot of terrible things about myself in this relationship like um i i learned that apparently im a nurturer like uh despite any of my wishes uh i like to do things for him like cook for him and do his laundry which is insane because i dont like to do my own laundry this is everything you need to know about why women arent ahead were just willing to do nice stuff for other people because it makes us feel good i didnt want this to be my life i didnt know cooking and doing laundry for a man would do something like bring me joy but it does i love to do it i love to take care of him its really lovely i started using fabric softener because of him i never used fabric softener before because i thought fabric softener was a scheme i thought it was a scheme by big laundry to just get us to use another liquid and so ive never used it before and one day he comes up to me and he approached me about this like anyone does who like wants something to keep happening you know he was like hey baby i love you so much do you ever notice our clothes are a little bit crunchyand when i ',\n",
       "  'hear crunchy clothes the first thing i think of is semen right but i know thats not why these clothes are crunchy cause i know where all the semen is going you know guys dont be gross in the trash can which is what i call my vaginathis is a this is just a tiny peek into a comedians life i riffed that joke on stage one night and i liked it so much that i was like id rather keep calling my vagina a trash can than not do that joke so the clothes are crunchy and its not cause of the semen because thats in old trash can over here hes like ever notice our clothes are crunchy i was like yeah i have noticed and he was like maybe we could start using fabric softener and then i went on my whole fabric softener is a scheme rant and he didnt leave you know so i thought that was pretty good and so i bought fabric softener and i started using it and you know what happens when you put fabric softener onto the clothes that you then put on your body it makes them softer its a perfectlynamed product i shouldve been using it this whole time know what i blame i blame the marketing theyre marketing this product wrong you got to get rid of that gay snuggie bear hes gay right him and the pillsbury doughboy theyre gay theyre theyre just out there touching tummies you know what fabric softener needs know what mascot fabric softener needs a sturdy lesbian just a sturdy lesbian on the cover being like it works okay and im not used to a lot of the stuff that comes with relationships he says very romantic and sweet things to me you know like hell say things like i could just look into your eyes forever you have the most beautiful eyes which to be honest made me feel okay about my body you know like just my eyes okay uh then i do the very girly thing that we sometimes do id be like well what happens when i get old and uh like my i hopefully age terribly you know and you know everything starts falling apart hes like i dont care i could look into your eyes forever theyre so beautiful i absolutely love staring into your eyes which is like a really sweet thing to say but then i thought of one more question i wanted to ask him but i didnt ask it because theres only one right answer and i knew if he didnt say the right answer id have to leave the question i wanted to ask was okay so what if someone plucked out my eyes and i just had two sockets then what would you do i didnt ask that question cause theres only one right answer and the right answer is walk away quietlycause thats the funniest way to leave a newly blind person is are you still there i feel your energy and it is you know like oh i should mention the guy im in a relationship with hes a black man and the only reason im telling you that is so you know im a good person uh its really relevant for the next couple jokes they dont work as well if hes not black uh there was one night i got home and he was asleep on the couch and the tv was on and i dont know what he fell asleep to but when i came in there was a video playing about white privilege i was like this is the most passiveaggressive thing ive ever seen like im the white woman in this relationship im the passiveaggressive one how are you supposed to how dare you try to outwhitewoman me so i did the whitestwoman thing i could think of i called the police and now hes dead so im kidding we live in spain they dont do that there they just give you an olive and make you take a nap but you know its been really great and actually not just this relationship but everything over the past couple years its really taught me we should always lead with love and kindness no matter what the relationship youre in your friends your family strangers especially strangers we should always lead with love and kindness and of course were gonna argue of course were gonna disagree and hopefully those arguments never get too bad but no matter what happens you should always try to be the first person always try to be the first person to say why are you yelling cause if you say that youve won and thats what its really all about if you want itive got itif you need itive got it part 2 all struggles matterme too hi guys how are youits fine i dont really carei always like being here in philadelphiai love being here in denver you guys you know you have a good town always happy to be here in salt lakei love coming to madison i love being back herethis is gonna be fun were gonna have a good timeive been noticing lately that a lot of comedians have been using their time on stage to talk about their struggles and how they identify and i think thats good for comedyum guys this is serious soguys im about to talk about my struggles i thought you know i could use my platform here to talk about how i struggle and how i identify you remember likeyears ago this commercial would come on that would be like do you have the urge to move your legs at night do you get a creepy crawly feeling in your legs you might have restless leg syndrome well it turns out i have restless leg syndrome and you know how i got diagnosed with restless leg sy',\n",
       "  'ndrome i listened to those symptoms and then i go yes i have it theres no cure and it is you get this like itchy kind of feeling in your legs at night you feel like you have to move them which also i mean even just to have this disease calling it a disease is a bit of a stretch its kind of like the white women of diseases you know where youre like is it a problem i dont like even to recognize that you have it you have to have a lot of time to rest i was just relaxing at home for hours when my legs were like move its either restless legs or its like prediabetes like its your body being like take a lapand its hard the more you talk about it kind of like the more like unbelievable it actually sounds like if there was a gofundme for restless leg syndrome and a cat who needed a wheelchair i think that cats getting a wheelchair we dont even know if he has restless legs cause he doesnt have anyoh dont be sad about a fake cat that i just made up and like this is not a great thing to complain about in the best of times but like were not in the best of times you know like were just out of pandemic people cant find baby formula gas is likean ounce meanwhile im like sometimes at night i have to wiggle my legs because of the itchys and the scratchys so i guess what id like to do tonight is id like to come out as insufferableyeahi feel validated because this black man just raised his glass to me and weunderstand suffering it has it has it has been a really hard time for white women i mean not literallylike a lot of people are coming out and talking about their struggles and white women are really trying to be a part of that its been kind of hard for us to do you know cause its hard to have like a struggle and a skin care routine like things are hard i did this joke the other night and a white lady screamed out she goes youre going the wrong way shes really having a hard time but i thought about it and i think white women i think i figured out what our struggle is i think our struggle is hearing how hard it is for other people is really hard for us like like we heard how hard it was for black people and we were devastated we saw pictures of the destruction in ukraine and we needed a social media break we heard about the crimes against humanity in palestine and we didnt really get into that one cause thats not one of the in crises but in general hearing how hard things are for other people has been really hard for us so hard we can barely make our own jewelryand like we blame a lot of stuff on white men you know and women you have done a lot of stufflike dont even get mad about it youve been really terrible but youre really good at it you know like white men came over from europe annihilated a civilization and then rebranded it as thanksgiving thats like pretty impressive you know and we blame a lot of stuff on you guys which is very funny to me because we act like we havent participated in it at all and we have participated at the most fundamental of levels we made youwere like the guy who made the atom bomb and were like but dont use it youd think weve spent all this time with white men you would think we would have picked up some tips and tricks by now you know you guys have the blueprint its like we havent learned anything its like we spent our whole life with michael jordan and only walked away with a bad gambling habit i think one of the reasons its been hard for us to get ahead is because white women we want to we dont want to give up being the victim you know but we also want to be in charge we want to be the head victim in charge you know we want to be the manager but we also want to be able to ask for the manager like i need to speak to the manager oh no thats me and im a bitch and were really good at being the victim you know were good at it like were the bride of victims no matter whats happening to other people were like no no its my dayand my dads kind of paying for the whole thing so and sometimes i get a bit frustrated with white women because by the way this whole section is gonna be about you white women if you havent picked that up yet so if youre starting you know starting to take offense dont worry just cross your arms this is not what i came here for sometimes i feel like were waiting for things to be nice for us you know because ive said it before you know white women we are oppressed sexism definitely exists you know but white men you guys were smart you kept us comfortable it was a very airconditioned oppression like you know again i dont want to downplay what happens to women you know like obviously sexism exists a lot of women get murdered and assaulted um by like you know okay so i looked up the statistics for this um for the joke not because i caredbut of the women who get murderedof them get murdered by someone they knowof that is by their husband so not are we getting murdered were getting murdered by the people who we love the most you know and then i heard about all these trans women getting murdered and assaulted and all i could think of when i he',\n",
       "  'ard that was welcome jump on in the water is terrible and full of missing womensome people will say no statistically more trans women are getting murdered im like are they getting murdered cause theyre trans or are they getting murdered cause theyre not used to presenting as a woman you know like i can understand if theyre getting murdered someones murdering them theyre like this is cause youre transby the way sorry im im stabbing the person i just looked at myself doing that i was like it looks like okay im not jerking the person off its a very different situation this is cause youre trans its a fun surprise you know technically maybe you could murder someone that way i dont know probably take a whileyoure almost out you know what im saying i no this is a knife and im stabbing this this is cause youre trans if thats how theyre getting murdered okay yes its because theyre trans or you know is it because theyre not used to presenting as women and theyre doing you know stuff they shouldnt be doing like walking home at night like you used to be a lion now youre a gazelle theres different rules bitch okay you cant do everything you used to be able to do you cant just hang around vans like what what happened did you speak up in a meeting or did you do the most dangerous thing of all did you marry the love of your life so i understand i understand when women are unhappy with society you know it makes sense to me but youre unhappy with society do something about it you know all i see is these white women karening and thats really frustrating to me first of all karening isnt new karenings been happening since the beginning of time you guys just finally started recording it like theres literally like cave paintings of karens its just a woman whos like youre not supposed to have a fire here karening frustrates me cause its such an ineffective use of your power you know like when white men are unhappy with society they really do something about it they really get in there you know they run for office they change laws they gerrymander they get their hands dirty you know when were unhappy with society we dont do that we just like knock over a display in target its so frustrating i think sometimes we think that like you know as individuals we cant create change and you can just you as an individual you can create change i see men do it all the time women you can do it on your own you know like um ted kaczynski wasnt happy with society and you know what he did he built a perfectly symmetrical cabin he wrote a manifesto and sure he sent some bombs in the mail which wasnt a great idea but you know what happened to him netflix made three documentaries and everyone knows ted kaczynski is the unabomber i dont even know a karens real name yall are just thrown under the umbrella of karen i want a white woman to do something where i know your full name be your own ted kaczynski and look you know like i dont always just like to present problems you know sometimes its good to have solutions too and so i think women white women i think at some point in your life you should be in a serious relationship with a black man all of us white women at some point in our life a serious relationship with a black man just yeah um maybe this guy uh hes sitting by himselfi need you to be in a serious relationship with a black man just so you can hear how stupid all of your complaints actually sound like if you both get home from a hard day and youre like i literally had the worst day and hes like yeah i had a bad day too and shes like well what happened to you well another black man was shot in the back by the police and it was actually a guy from my neighborhood and he wasnt even running away he was walking away and this stuff just keeps happening and its never going to change and ive lost like all hope and im just so angry but what happened to youuh eh –no its not important no baby in this house we share what happens to you happens to me um well today at work this guy called me a girl and im a woman i can feel some women in here be like well she is i make fun of white women a lot and the only reason i do it is because its fun and easy but its not fair you also deserve credit for some stuff too you know like remember a couple of summers ago when we realized that black lives matter waiting until a couple summers ago to realize things have been hard for black people is like needing to see that documentary to know seaworld is bad like did you know whales shouldnt live in a sinkbut you know what we did we realized things were hard and white women really got out there they protested they advocated you know they really tried to do the work but then something devastating happened to a lot of us white women a lot of us white women realized were the ones whove been racist this whole time we were shocked we were so shocked we pulled our purse closer but even after that we were like wow we didnt even know we were like this from now on were going to learn were going to listen were going to hear were going to open a ',\n",
       "  'small black business but most importantly from now on were going to do better we want to do better and honestly all jokes aside thats all we can do as a society we cant change the past all we can do is better in the future i genuinely think thats the path forward for usexcept thats almost exactly what men said after me too and we found that answer completely unacceptable men were like us the whole time we didnt even know from now on we want to learn and listen and hear and open a small black business but most importantly from now on we want to do better were going to do better and we were like no not good enough you all have to die every one of you doesnt matter what you did you could have raped somebody or accidentally whispered into a boob its all the same and you have to die me too was the worstrun movement ive ever seen i was so frustrated by it because i think we genuinely could have made social change we could have made things better for women and men but we fucked it up from the very beginning and i tried i tried to get involved in me too i didnt want to get me tood not how i wanted to get involved i thought the more fun way to get involved would be to like me too men you know but that didnt really work out that just turned into three onenight stands its really hard to me too a guy you ever tried to me too a man its very hard you go up to a guy at work youre like hey nice ass hell be like oh my god no one has ever complimented my body most people call me smart and capable but you made me feel pretty and i touch your boobs its hard you know everyone has different lines you know i dont even think some men know where their line is i think some men go so far past their line when they finally turn around and see it theyre like i have to go home and also men you like gross things you do you know this about yourselves you like gross things like i was in thailand and i went to one of those pingpong showsif you dont know what they are its not a game of pingpong i dont know its a little a little bit a game of pingpong its these shows where women put pingpongs and other things in their vaginas and then they shoot them out at quite a velocity i mean these things really come at you and its not just pingpongs one lady smoked out of her vagina another lady sucked up a little goldfish and then spit that guy back out and it was still alive which i thought was very impressive thats like a solid ph that ladys working withof course the main event they put pingpongs in their vaginas and then they shoot them out and im telling they really come at ya this isnt even a joke they give you paddles to hit them away with and you wanna hit them away theres probably some guys who are like oh no i missed oh if the guy youre with ohd too loud hes one of them and i dont know if this is just cause im like a competitive person but as soon as i saw this i started to wonder which of those things i could do every woman in this room i think we all have the ability to smoke out of our vaginas i think i think we can all do that i just wouldnt do it if youre pregnant you know you dont want your baby to think hes like too cool you know the fish one the fish one i would never try i would never try the fish one because if the fish died i would be mortified id be like what too fishy for you the pingpong one thats the one you want to know about yourself every woman in this room is asking herself the same question right now say it with me can i shoot pingpongs out of my vaginaso i tried and now im just chockfull of pingpongs if anyone wants to play a game later just dropkick me in the stomach get some of those pingpongs out and hopefully that babyyou gotta keep abortion jokes early in the set you knowbefore its a baby so the point is the only reason i tell that story is because that show only exists because men you like gross things theres no female version of that show were not going anywhere to see men shoot anything out of their bodies in fact the one thing you do shoot out of your bodies oftentimes were like hey can you wipe this off im getting sticky thats one of the reasons i think me too is confusing for men cause theres some weird gross me toos out there but i think theyre all things men would have liked if it happened to them like if i went up to a guy at a party and i was like hey i saw you from across the room and then i came into a bush i think if i said that to a guy at a party he would be like tell me more about that coming into a bush at a party thats like a classic harvey weinstein i dont know bithe was kind of like the cornerstone of the whole me too movement and rightfully so he did a lot of terrible things you know and he was on trial a lot of women testified against him and this one woman testified she goes harvey offered me a role in exchange for sex and when i said no he goes then youll never make it in hollywood because thats how a lot of women make it in hollywood and then supposedly he started naming names hes like thats how charlize theron made it salma hayek and thats the part yo',\n",
       "  'u never really think about you know for like all the bad me toos out there theres like a couple success onesyeah it makes this whole thing a lot grayer doesnt it but you should not have to give a blowjob to get ahead you should not have todo it but you can this is just about knowing your skill set you know whod be really mad to hear this information prostitutes theyre like you got an oscar i gotpersonally i dont think i could ever do it you know just because the guys who offer it are all kind of gross you know theyre like the harvey weinsteins the roger ailes like i would talk about it im a bit of a talker you know id be like oh no smells down here yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck this was a lot more complicated of a situation than we let it be we needed to have conversations around it and we couldnt even have conversations you were either me too or me against there werent even levels there should have been some levels you know like me too me kinda me didnt knowme criminaland some stuff some truly terrible stuff happened to women and other stuff i was like no you just had a weird sex thing i heard one woman say this man put his penis on her forehead during sex and she said that was a me too i was like no you just had weird sex thats the day you found out if you like a penis on your forehead and if you do guess what me too so you got any ideas in there its fun try it later uh you know askwe needed to have conversations you need to be able to ask questions because everyone has a different line you know one womans line is another womans rope she likes to be tied up with youd hear a lot of women say men shouldnt use their power to have sex other women would be like i like when men use their power to have sex and then men were like can you tell us which one you are and we were like no but for different reasons you hear some women be like this man he hit on me at work thats harassment it made me feel uncomfortable like okay do you want no one to hit on you at work no i only want the men who i want to hit on me to hit on me at work okay do you want to make a list of who they are no im mysterious well then buckle up nancy drew you got some uncomfortable times headed your way and i did i genuinely saw men try to get better you know i saw men trying to listen to us and do better like uh i was in riding in a car with a guy and he asked to hold my hand and i wasnt used to that level of consent you know like i mean i wasnt used to rape either im more of a socialcues girl and but he asked to hold my hand and i was so taken aback by it that my first reaction was oh no he must be sick or scared so i grabbed his hand and i was like its going to be okay buddy you know relationships are complicated things between us are complicated you know and women you know were a little bit to blame for some of this stuff too like uh were attracted to the most dangerous type of man you know we like those big strong guys tall guys with broad shoulders you know how many times ive said i want a big strong guy who can pick me up and throw me against the wall and then other women have definitely said he was big and strong and then he threw me against the wall same guy uh and i say were partially responsible for that because women were at the point now where we decide who we marry we decide who we mate with we are attracted to those guys so we marry them we have kids with them we make more of them if we really wanted to make society better we could just stop doing that we could only marry we could only marry short softboned men get a whole generation of little danny devitos running around thats actually why i think a lot of men dont want to give women access to abortion i think you know deep down that we could start deciding which of you gets to move aheadwe could keep a whole database we could be like no no not him he doesnt text back sorry kevin the futures for communicators were also inexplicably women were attracted to bad men you know like i dont know why but were just attracted to bad guys like charles manson got wedding proposals in jail women heard what charles manson did and they thought id like to be in a relationship with that man even charles manson had to be like you wanna be in a relationship with me thats a red flag were like oddly attracted to serial killers anytime netflix comes out with a new documentary about serial killers were like attracted to them its crazy to me cause one theyre serial killers and two it makes me think about how we dont have many female serial killers and the ones we do all kind of make sense you know theyre all prostitutes who killed their johns and i can see how that could go south you know shes probably like wheres my oscarbut male serial killers we know the same thing about all of you male serial killers all had terrible moms but a lot of us women we have terrible dads and we dont turn into serial killers we just turn into people who have sex with other dads it makes me so frustrated at women im like can you stop being a peoplepleaser for five fucking minutes an',\n",
       "  'd get to murderingyou know be the change you knowif you want itive got itif you need itive got it part 3 news to meall beautiful hi guys how are youits fine i dont really carei always like being here in philadelphiai love being here in denver you guys you know you have a good town always happy to be here in salt lakei love coming to madison i always love being back herethis is gonna be fun were gonna have a good timei think a lot of times women we always feel like we have to like support other women which i dont think we need to do that umlike thats like a lot to ask of a whole gender you know we dont ask that of men you know like men arent like men should support other men thats not theyre just like well invade its okay its totally fine not to like other theres plenty of women that i dont like you know but sometimes ill find out information about them that will at least like let me understand them like i saw an article about nancy reagan first of all ive never been a fan of nancy reagan i always thought she was a tiny little cunt you know yeah thats just my opinion i dont know its not but i saw an article about her recently that made me at least understand her uh the article talked about how in hollywood in thenancy reagan was known as the throat goat yeah little old nancy reagan in hollywood in thewas known for the best at giving blow jobs do you know how hard it is to be the best at giving blow jobs in hollywood in thethats how people auditioned and she was the best she was the michael jordan of blow jobs little old nancy reagan but then after i read that her whole life made sense to me its like of course she hated gay men they were her competition shes like we gotta keep aids around my cheeks are getting tiredyou know i saw that news story i actually read that news story like i feel like a lot of us read news these days which is i saw it and i wanted to believe it was true so then i just did you know like i didnt check sources or anything now that im thinking about it i really wanna know what the sources are its like a bunch of older men who are likeyou know you know shes really good if that was the one thing ronald reagan remembered when nancy puts me in her mouth hey this is a cabinet meeting okay someone get him more jelly beans we needbut i think thats what a lot of us do now when we look at the news you know we see something that kind of fits in line with what we want to believe and then because we feel its true it is and thats an incredibly dangerous place to be as a society plus once somethings out there about you it doesnt actually matter if its true or not people will just believe it theres some things out there about me that arent true but im sure people believe it like after i did the correspondents dinner i got a lot of trolling and to be honest most trolling very boring you know its just repetitive you know a lot of its like you bitch you cunt you carrot toplooking motherfucker and thats just me in the mirror so well how do you come i got one really good troll after the correspondents dinner i appreciated this troll it was creative he put in time and effort it was really good what he did was he took what looked like a screenshot of my actual hometown newspaper the hershey chronicle and so i mean the font was correct a lot of information in the article was right like where i went to school when i graduated what i majored in the meat of the article was incorrect the headline read wolf pleads guilty to bestiality out of the box though right you know and i tried to find this article again and i just i googled wolf bestiality i think i got a bit egotistical where i was just like i was like oh wait i need more words than that but thats a fun rabbit hole if you want to go down that one but the title of this article said wolf pleads guilty to bestiality so now i find myself in the odd position to have to say things like no ive never had sex with a dog but as soon as you have to say youve never had sex with a dog it sounds like maybe youve had sex with a dog by the way that was the bestiality they were referring to they said my bestiality was dog sex if when i said bestiality you pictured a different animal guess what thats the animal you would have sex with and now you know that about yourself so thats fun and exciting you know this article now all of a sudden it makes me think of things that i never even wanted to think about before like how do i have sex with a dog im a woman how am i fucking a dog so then id think about how id have sex with a dog and i think the answer is you put peanut butter on your pussy and now it sounds like ive maybe fucked a dog by the way if you ever do want to have sex with a dog it said after i pleaded guilty that i only gotmonths probation andfine so if thats your thing you might want to head over to pennsylvania it doesnt sound like its gonna put you in that deep of a hole you know but were in wisconsin maybe check the laws here they might be better theres a lot of farmland theres a lot of farmland people get lonely i get it',\n",
       "  ' but yeah ive never had sex with a dog but if i was going to im not having sex with a rescueim having sex with a purebred dog a big silkycoated dog a dog who could really take care of me and honestly that would be fine if that was the only information out there about me um its not do you guys remember jeffrey epstein like of the pedophiles so at some point someone put a list of all the people who apparently went to epsteins island out and its like a pretty good list its got barack obama beyoncé meryl streep tom hanks also on the list me well thats not good now it looks like i fuck kids and dogs it looks like im really going out of my way not to have sex with men which if i was interested in both kids and dogs a perfect combination of that is menand now i find myself in a position no one ever wants to be in which is having to say the phrase no ive never had sex with a kid ive never even been to that island but by the way if all those people are going im gonna go you probably dont have to do anything there you can probably just get a cocktail and see what meryl streeps into which hopefully is roleplay you know shes a really good actress i dont know so i know i had to say things like ive never had sex with a kid and i havent but if i was going to have sex with a kid i wouldnt go to some billionaires island to do it id do it the normal way and become a teacheri know we should pay them more get them suppliesi hear all the time women talk about how we should all be beautiful how we should all feel beautiful so its like were all beautiful were all beautiful well first of all that means were still valuing women on beauty were like you have to be beautiful to be important so well just make sure every woman feels beautiful which is maybe not the right metric also a little problem with that plan were not all beautifulthe only reason you know someones beautiful is cause youve seen someone whos not youre like yeah thats different than that like recently i was at the same event as naomi campbell and people kept wanting us to take a picture together and i was like no im not gonna document how different humans can be my skill set doesnt come across in a photographnot too much okay guysalso but how dare you how dare you want every woman to be beautiful dont you think theres women out there who knew they were ugly they knew they were ugly so they got good at something they got respected for their abilitiesand then and then some little bitch comes up to her and shes like youre beautiful its like no shut up i got a horse face and im an electrical engineer we gotta stop we gotta stop with all this beautiful nonsense we should even stop telling little girls theyre beautiful i think as soon as they can understand us you look that little girl right in the eye and you go with a face like that you get good at mathwere all beautiful so much so much of our existence is based off of beauty and its such a waste of time like victorias secret just hired their first down syndrome model dont worry this isnt gonna be a joke about down syndrome you dont have to draw a real hard line in the sand victorias secret just hired their first down syndrome model and everyone was like this is such a great accomplishment for women and dont get me wrong im glad that lady has a job but uh can we stop acting like women posing with no clothes or almost no clothes is an accomplishment its literally the least you could do this is how little of an accomplishment it is i couldnt think of something it was like i kept thinking like i dont know a baby learning how to use a spoon and i was like i dont know its still an accomplishment it is literal its the least you can do theres nothing impressive about it its not moving the needle forward for women at all we seem to have this idea that if every woman can pose nude finally well get ahead its not its not doing anything for us you know its like we want equality and then someone was like how about every type of woman can be in a dove commercial and we were like well take it they were like really this feels like a whole beads for new york situation cause weve seen it weve seen every type of woman every age weight race number of arms weve seen it all theres nothing impressive about it you know and we were the ones women we were the ones who needed to see it you know we saw what the standard model was and we said i want that men didnt do this men didnt put these ideas in our heads men saw every woman and theyre like ill take that one yeah thats neat too okay line em up thats what it feels like it feels like were trying to get verification that a man will jerk off to anything thats how low the bar is for men its like oh chad hell beat it to almost anything were like hes an ally also like women you should want to be a little bit ugly i promise itll help you out i get called ugly all the time i dont care i have a skill i dont care also i hope i age terribly cause the uglier i get the better this all worksthe uglier i get the more people i can make fun of like i cant do any accents ',\n",
       "  'or impressions okay theres one accent i can do and its a very offensive asian accent dont ask me how i know okay i wanna get so ugly that i can do that accent and even asian people will be like its okay and also women if youre a little bit ugly men are gonna be much more likely to believe youre capable and women too by the way women are much theyre also gonna believe youre more capable if youre a little bit ugly if you have a bit of a busted face and youre like im a mathematician people will be like that tracks yeah oh dont get sad about it its true you are the problemthats sad she thinks shes ugly who cares shes got a fucking job oh this lady is so drunk it doesnt matter look at some of our most successful women we dont really think about these women because we never equate womens success with like not being beautiful but some of our most successful women very ugly people some of these references are a little old theyre just my personal favorites janet reno renojanet reno was the first female attorney general one of the longestever serving attorney generals worked for democrats republicans this lady was great at attorney generalingif you cant remember what janet reno looks like she looked like what larry bird looks like now for context will ferrell played her on saturday night live and his costume was like a little bit of lipstick not a pretty lady everyone trusted hereveryones favorite ruth bader ginsburgyeah ugly little old bird she actually looks like a birds foot all like wrinkly and bony and like a little bit you know great supreme court justice not a pretty lady no ones slinging dicks at ruth its just such its such a waste of time its a waste of all of our times and our talents then for a while there was this group of women they were the i dont care women and honestly thats like the right lane to be in but these women were pretending they didnt care they actually cared because they posted about how much they didnt care on social media theyre like i dont care what you think im confident i dont care im confident feels like youre trying to beetlejuice confidence but these i dont care women they dont wear makeup work out do their hair they dont care if thats what you want to do thats totally fine but what are you doing cause i know how much time all of that takes me so if youre not doing that what are you doing are you attorney general are you fluent in all the languages how are you spending all of this extra time like men have never really cared about how theyve looked but they have almost everything to show for it they invented almost everything theyre like so sorry i look like this but heres electricity no wait till it gets dark this is gonna blow your mind youre gonna be able to stare in the mirror longer and the worst part is these i dont care women they were getting grouped in with powerful women like look at these i dont care women look at them theyre such great examples no youre not a powerful woman youre a mediocre man and if thats what you want to be thats fine having openly mediocre women i think thats a big step forward i think thats really good for women if you want to be mediocre you do it you lean into it have fun wear elastic but know youre mediocre you know dont you go blaming stuff on sexism if you dont get a promotion dont be like thats sexist its like no you dont know excel its an intuitive program but thats the kind thats the kind of equality i want for women i want true equality for women i want women to be just as good as men just as mediocre and just as shitty you know i want us to be in charge of stuff id love to see us leave our kidsand id like to see a few serial killers good ones too like good creepy deadeyed wearyourskin serial killersthe kind netflix makes a

       " ['comedy mike birbiglia my girlfriends boyfriend– transcript march 3 mike birbiglia gives his audience a honest insight into his personal experiences over his life of tumultuous relationshipswow hey thank you thanks thank you guys hey seattle nice to see you look at this look at us were here this is crazy its insane so about five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i dont really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person im arguing with and the reason its a source of tension is that im right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes well you dont believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people and i was like no i think its insane you know for anyone and she said whyand i said well first of all it just seems doomed you knowof marriages end in divorce thats just first marriages by the way second marriagestoend in divorce third marriagestoend in divorce thats a learning curvesecond of all monogamys impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when i say that i think people assume that im implying that men are incapable of being faithful i think women are just as incapable but for more sophisticated reasons you know i mean with men were just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when i say that my female friends are like well we like sex just as much as you do and i said sure but its different and they say how and i say have you ever masturbated while driving a carnumber three im never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think thats not brought up often enough i um i didnt know that would be the reaction oh no thats the hopeful partthe uh i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and hes a comedian as well not only did we decide we werent gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it like we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages you know we were we were pretty good i mean we werent like the best in the world im sure there are better in europe but we were we were solid you know like so like for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said are you sure this is what you want to do and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we werent friends anymoreso february im at andys house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause hes the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youre right he says stuff like she sounds crazy like even if what shes saying isnt that crazy like youd be like she only eats whole wheat bagels hed be like she sounds crazy youd be like thats not even the crazy part you know so im telling him about his argument and he goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and im driving out of andys small road and im tboned i dont know if youre familiar with this term uh this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car drivers side at a egree angle like a tbone steak and in 1seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i knowlet me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i uh no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was like scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times ill write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes what are you doing and i said im writing my set list and then she goes i think itll be fine and i was like no it wont be fine and then she was like i think it will be okay and i said why do you think that and she said well you look so nervous i think theyll feel sorry for you but jenny has this really soft sweet voice like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage normally id be offended by that but in this instance i was like you are right that is a great point you are beautiful you know she re she really was you know from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me uh i mean i mean that in like in the most meaningful way like that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i id jus id just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and and then we werent and then when we werent i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely you know and but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didnt i didnt think it was gonna happenlike i dont have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if im seeing a girl shed think id have sex with him maybe you know and im im not ashamed of that there were periods in my lif',\n",
       "  'e where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just dont give off a great first impression like ill give you an example like this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight like i didnt i didnt spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt i mean this is my a outfit my b outfit was naked i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixerupper ive reached this point in my life i dont really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment i glance at it to make sure im not bleeding you know what i mean like but i dont stare at the mirror if i stare at the mirror i get angry like i feel like im complaining about a bad call a ref just made im like come on youre blind if youre leaving the house like that and the ref is god and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline and its a close game cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast and im all riled up im about to charge the field and the guy comes by with fried dough and im like next time you know thats how i go for fried dough cause i have a problem i justthis is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second im gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so ive been going uh recently to a womens exercise class iive given up on having a traditional male physique and so now im going for strong independent woman and uh its going pretty well you know im not as good in the class as you might think sometimes ill kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnt looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though ive been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics you know how they do gymnastics how theyll have those the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while and im not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes theyll fall and its ugly cause theyre rolling around like im in a lot of trouble like i dont even know how i got here but at the end of that no matter what and i totally fall for it im like that cant possibly be the same loser from moments ago i mean thats a completely different person this person has much better posture for startersi really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i dont know and uh i didnt have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and uh pfft which yeah i dont know if that was the best idea cause uh were heading were in the car heading to the pub and jenny says oh i left my id at the hotel and i was like oh we can just swing back and get it and shes like shes like no itll be fine i was like no it wont be fine cause its st patricks day and theres bouncers and she goes no itll be okay and i was like no it wont be okay and then we get to the pub and it was fine like the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are like prison guards and for jenny theyre like birthday clowns like you know what can i do to make your day betteryou know and thats were at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasnt the idea and so i said i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on like the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but uh but she warmed to me as the night went on cause she was drinking and then like no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says sure we get to her door and i didnt want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says oh no thank you which i thought was polite but disappointing i mean theres something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youre really putting yourself out there youre just like i think we should connect mouths you know and the other persons like i do not think we should connect mouths and those are theyre two very different mouth agendas you know and then you just feel so stupid youre like i never should have suggested we connect mouths you knowthis is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses like i i remember growing up like when people started making out like in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember i remember it like it was yesterday cause i was shocked i was like people we know are just making out with other people we know but how you know it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was like i am not doing that and collectively all the girls in my class were like that is fine you are not on t',\n",
       "  'he list youre not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity i was like perfect it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of like sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like i dont like when i see two dudes making out in the street and i feel that way about anyone like making out is just sloppy its like watching a dog eat spaghetti thats how i make out is that right does anybody know if thats right okay goodso in seventh grade i was like im not gonna make out with anybody and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was like the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned like we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order first order of business nintendo second order of business why doesnt anyone like us meeting adjourned i dont know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was like i got to try to get into the makeout club but it was a very intangible goal i didnt really talk to a lot of girls and there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league like she had many suitors she had i dont the rest of the show is in old english uh she doth had many suitors uh no she had many you know admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was like oh this is great i got to do that more and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well cause she goes mike you got to stop im gonna pee myself and i was like wow this was the closest id ever come to a vagina so spent the nextyears trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and thats how i ended up here yeah thats how we all ended up here in a senseso uh so heres what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldnt believe it like all of a sudden i thought well maybe this will be like one of those romantic comedy montages well go to the carnival well get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel well make out itll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song but i think that when youreyears old you just dont understand certain things about your digestive system you dont know that you shouldnt eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items its basically saying were gonna take sugar which everyone knows is bad but then well dress it up like insulation and im like im not sure what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation theyre like we already sold it im like well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates i dont know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the shits of pantserator and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said they said we like it but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy says well what about the i think im gonna dieerator and theyre like thats good cause it gets across the essence of how you feel when youre on the machine plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea which is a nice homage to the original intention of the machine but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy goes well what about the scrambler cause it scrambles you theyre like we get it frank but who frank is a maniac this guy cant be stopped but every once in a while hes got a good idea but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment and this one guy goes well i have a nephew whosyears old and smokes pothours a day i feel like he might be available and theyre like he sounds amazing we dont even need to interview him he sounds completely qualifiedi sit down with lisa on the scrambler and im feeling good like shes snuggling up close to me and im thinking im thinking like this could be it this could be where its all gonna happen this is very special and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment its not a ralph nader approved item i dont think its saved lives i think the only thing its ever done is in a scrambler accident its just sort of held someones esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident dont talk about scrambler accident thats from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the earold stoner i was like hey actually and then he was gone apparently he doesnt enjoy the second halves of sentencesso then im scrambling and as i am scrambling im thinki',\n",
       "  'ng i need to come up with a plan of some kind im not going down without a fight my first plan was very simple it was just dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i was like dont look at lisa dont look at any other people dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i need a new plan and the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator that he needed to stop the ride but the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so im like i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride please stop the ride and im back im not sure he heard me i got to say it louder please stop the ride im not sure hes paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now the third time i said please stop and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just popcorn peanuts insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but im pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that eveningtwo years later it gets worse um im at the st johns high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st johns gymnasium like cattle which is a friendly way to describe women you know so cattle shows up atwell make out with the cattle cattle goes home atthen we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just like this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss cause it was like this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask like oh have you had your first kiss id be like yeah like all the time like every every week i always feared at some point thered be a followup question like oh yeah whats it like and id be like yeah you know its just like licking an ice cream cone and theyd be like no its not its like sucking on a rocket pop and id be like ah wrong frozen dessert analogy im at the dance and im flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and were introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were like moo and we were like moo and then sam says one of these phrases i think weve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says you get that one which i know its the worst turn of phrase but im comfortable saying it cause i know ive been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me you get that one and then her friend goes like oof you know or even worse or even worse like you owe me which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someones credit score you know so he goes he goes you get that one and then im just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mcs bust a move and im not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so its only catching me one out of every five hey so shes losing interest but atthe speed and then im saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long whats great about slow dancing is you cant really mess it up cause its just sort of a slowmotion hug like the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it shed be like what are you doing and id be like i dont pick up on social cues you know but its such a long song you know stairway so im just trying not to fidget im sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didnt know anything about making out but id seen people do it i could see theres like a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was like some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no you know theres no video documentation of that area its like the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive theyve only seen it washed up on the shore which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but so im trying not to fidget then with 1minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was like oh no i dont want to be alone anymore and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then its an allout mouth war and she had artillery cause she had braces it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is im not alone anymore im not in the nonmakeout club and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldnt because up until that point id lied and said that id had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was like howd it go dude i had to be like same as always pretty smoothas the week wore on i started to convince myself well maybe it did go well and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind but i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief you know we didnt have a lot to talk about i remember just being like hey you like full house ',\n",
       "  'me neither cool all right later you know what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from her kind of like why are you calling me and i remember thinking oh im probably reading into that one too much and and then she stopped calling me back and i was like oh yeah i read into that one perfectly but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldnt even tell my friends until one day i was i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was like hey whats going on with sandra like she hasnt called me back and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was like what tom was like nothing and i was like what tom was like nothing and i was like what toms like oh i talked to sandra and she said youre the worst kisser shes ever kissed and it was so devastating cause not only was it probably true but i couldnt explain to my friends why it was true i couldnt say that makes sense ive never done that before so instead i had to play it off i had to be like yeah that sounds about right im a terrible kisser thats kind of my thingso i lean in to kiss jenny and she says oh no thank you she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be jen irish pub nice a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldnt afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card were out to dinner and she says to me she goes everyone hates me at work and i said why would they hate you i love you she goes you love me i go i mean you seem cool i pulled it back i didnt want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said you know sometimes ill date two people at once and that way im never let down by either person i said that seems like a really smart plan like id like to do that as well and she said im still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if youre seeing them and i was like all right sounds like a plan got it break i got to go find some more people you know and so a few nights later im in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later im out to dinner with jenny and she says how was your trip and i said it was great i did some shows and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl and that didnt go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was like but im right about that right like im supposed to tell you if that happens right and she says yeah but it doesnt mean that i wont lose interest in you and i said thats a whole new clause thats a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects i said are you still seeing john and she said sometimes i said well dont you see the contradiction in that and she says yes and it gets very quiet because we were falling in lovethree weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didnt have a lot left we went to bermuda cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when its winter in new york it is also winter in bermuda and uh jenny and i meet up at the airport and shes late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler im always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and and jennys late and then we get to security and im not making this up she doesnt have a license or a passport and i said what do you mean i go how do you travel and she goes well usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id i dont like to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just cant imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because theyre just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are thevirgins and you know the women wouldnt want that unless theyre lesbians although theres an idea you know alqaeda alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although then theyd have to guarantee that thevirgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds you know allvirgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as like a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity like thevirgins are like i didnt even know i was a lesbian until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist and now thats all im into i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy theyd die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me andof my friends but now i dont see khalid in the same way anymorethe point is we went to bermuda and were on the flight on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says congratulations on your honeymoon and we said oh no thanks were not on our honeymoon and she walks away and jenny says thats so funny i dont think ill ever go on a honeymoon and i said oh really and she goes yeah i dont think id ever want to get married in my life and i said oh really i go me too i said is that b',\n",
       "  'ased on a principle or did you have a bad relationship like what was your first boyfriend like and she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was they were at the same bus stop when they wereand they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they you know their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said then what and she said he died he had leukemia and i said well do you ever talk about this with anyone and she says no i dont really like to talk about it but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night wed be up tillorin the morning and we were so happy we at one point i was like well we should do this again we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport jenny said that sounds great but i dont think id get a license or a passport cause they dont make me get one and i was like yeah but its the law you know jenny says yeah i dont think ill get one cause they dont make me get one you know thats how i feel thats how jenny argues things sometimes shell just say thats how i feel and ill say thats not an argument like were not even in an argument right now because you dont have an argument and shell say i just won that argument and ill say thats not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is and shell say i just won that argument again thats how i feelyou could see how this could be a little bit maddening you know uh on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said we should play and i was like yeah but not like a game and she said why and i said well cause id win and she said no i think i would win i go no i know that id win and i know that what im supposed to say is that the guy says ill win the girl says ill win and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just dont have that in me and jenny goes you dont have to let me win lets go out and play and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just like it was just liketo 1 you knowto 1 i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said ive never met someone whos so obsessed with the score and i said the score is what makes it a gameso were arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then were still arguing about it atorin the morning about essentially nothing and she said i dont understand why youre so obsessed with being right i go im not obsessed with it i just am i said why do you think youre right and she says thats how i feel i said if you think im so wrong about everything why are you even with me and jenny says you cant choose who you love which is true but it doesnt mean its good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and youre just like this is it i found her imyears old and im done you know and her name was amanda and she was like adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was like a delinquent like i was like this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality like at one point she was like it was totally messed up because it wasnt even me it was this other girl and i was framed and i was just like awesome like no one would ever frame me for anything i just i thought it was like an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool at one point i was like do you want to write an article for the newspaper she goes i dont want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about and i was like good answeri find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back shed be like no one likes you at all only kidding or like youre like a nerd but youre not even smart just joking cant choose who you lovesecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i dont i dont mean that in an offensive way like lying was kind of like a its like a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar youd know when he was lying cause he would lick his finger like a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and hed go yeah yeah nice nice you know and he wasnt even handling money like i dont even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant hed be like yeah my uncles tony robbins motivational speaker yeah nice you know and we found out that that wasnt even true but even if that were true that wouldnt be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think thats the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when youre lying about big stuff its like bankingthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know im in the future also i think we can all see now cause were so smart and mikes so dumb and uh you know i can also see in retrospect thats a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and ',\n",
       "  'she said she had another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that you know i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought well this is the affirmation that i need im gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend and i drive my moms station wagon to amandas parents house and i walk in the front door and theres amanda and theres her parents and its going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott im assuming hes like a family friend or a relative and slowly im noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend theyre both in their first year in college and theyre competitive wrestlers and its dawning on me that im hanging out with my girlfriends boyfriend and its going pretty well i mean he he seemed like a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say i wish it were just you and me here and i remember thinking you could make that happen the way she said it was as though she werent involved in the decision process like id love to but the boys in corporatewell the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriends boyfriends parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression you know youre like maybe if this goes well shell see that im good with adults in general as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me how do you know amanda and i said were just friends from school and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking i am never gonna let this happen to me againso ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful cause it was in texas and i thats thats not to say i dislike texas entirely its such a large thing to dislike and uh but that week it felt like texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy i love comedy clubs cause theyre sort of a highlow entertainment proposition like in some ways though theyre the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws you know like theresbachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and theyre handing out gummy penises or whatever thats thats actually a thing i didnt even realize that i didnt realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was was the gummy quality of the penis i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i but thats thats not my job im you know i leave that to the experts but i just i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and id been drinking all week and uh i always try to be a team player you know so i was like whatever i can do to help i dont see how this could end badly and uh the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and im hung over and im groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight im still two hours early and i land in new york and i get a cab to jennys parents house and i walk in the front door and theres jenny and theres her parents and theres her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasnt front and center like he was just kind of around like he was in the pool like wading and doing laps like that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was like well whats john doing here and she says well he and i arent still together but when we were together he became friends with my stepdad and hes been staying here at their house the last couple weeks and i said you know thats not good i feel like that gives him the edge jennys staring at me and i said what she says you have a hickey on your neck and i said i dont think thats true and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say im really sorry and she says where is that from and i said there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk that sentence never comes out right i mean theres no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay and we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didnt have a leg to stand on i was like well what about john what was he doing there she said you have a hickey on your neck i said yeah but at least i told you the truth and she said eventually and i said eventually is better than never and then she kneed me in the balls i dont know if youve ever experienced this before im sure half of you have not uh its like being electrocuted except you dont get to die ',\n",
       "  'its like you want to die but you cant and theres a person in your face saying you deserve this which they wouldnt even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane\\xa0 even in texasjenny says i think that we should just break up you know its not just this i mean youre away a lot of the time and even when youre here you work at night and i work in the day i just dont think its gonna work out and i said okay\\xa0 and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while id get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen irish pub nice and it would just say hi and id write back hi it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new years i caved in and i called her i said hey i really miss you and i want to see you and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just like we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there you know i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was like the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said what and she says i think that we should live together and i said no i really dont think thats a good idea you know ive just decided you know as a principle im not gonna get married or live with someone its not personal and she said well unless we live together i just dont think its gonna work out cause we just dont see each other enough and i dont think that we stand a chance thats how i feelso we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said oh no thanks that doesnt go over so well she says why and i said well as you know i dont believe in marriage and so i dont buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it she said well what do you believe in and i said i dont know she said well if you dont believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage and i said well first of all you know it just doesnt seem necessary i mean is it you know marriage is an archaic institution invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property i dont want to be a part of that second of all i dont even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is i mean one of me and andys friends was about to get engaged and we were skeptical and we said are you sure this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life and he goes yeah i think so and we said well what if she gets in a car accident and shes disfigured would you stay with her then and he said maybe that is not an acceptable answer third of all if im so in love why does it need to be written into a government contract and im not one of these like i dont want government up in my business kind of people i think the government does a nice job delivering the mail and suggesting i dont eat poison but i just dont understand why they need to be involved in my personal relationships then finally if marriage is religious shouldnt i believe in the religion ive been to more weddings of my friends where the people on the altar dont believe in the religion of the church theyve invited us to some of them even go to classes with the priest in advance to more elaborately lie about believing in a religion they dont believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building that is insane thats how i feel so i explain this to jenny and jenny says well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you and i said why arent you listening to any of this and jenny says thats how i feelat this point it wasin the morning wed been arguing all night and we hadnt slept i had to catch a flight atam out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point im overtired and im angry and im late im stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment itsam that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isnt even there theres a guy with a laptop going we need a road stat whats the code for building tank you know and i get to the airport the news hasnt even started yet its just an anchor looking around like what are you up to and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes well that aint your gate like i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was like i was not involved in this process i wasnt even ccd like as though i had gone to the kiosk and been likelike hell im flying out ofand then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been like this is where im going you know im not that aggressive as a traveler so i was like well where is this gate she goes its in another terminal you got to take a tram she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say and you better run like i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was like i dont want to run i have wheels and i was like i dont want to run either but this is what we have to do i tell you what when we get to the hotel ill walk you in circles for a few hours then i i get to t',\n",
       "  'he tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was like perfect thats exactly how long i want to wait but the trams riding away i was like thats 1 minute then it says ten minutes and im experiencing that psychological downward spiral like oh great im gonna miss my flight and then im gonna miss every flight from now on and im gonna miss my family reunion and then im not gonna have a family and then im gonna be a crack whore and its like all of a sudden im a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time andi get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and im sweaty and im out of breath but im on time and im so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally id be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady im a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think thats an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was like do you know these people she was like all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy i was like drew barrymores character come back she didnt come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas you know how i feel about texas and uh i get to los angeles late that night and id missed my show id never missed one of my shows before and im so angry and jennys calling me but im not picking up the phone cause im blaming this entire day on heri get back to my friend andys house and i said andy this relationship is messing up my entire life and andy goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning i drive out of andys small road and im tboned thats the culinary way of describing it in 1seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive awayminutes later im sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri have arrived as well as my friend andy and thats when i start crying you know how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesnt doesnt start crying right away because it doesnt understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then its like oh i guess i should be doing something that matches that waah im crying because im looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist like i said earlier i dont really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things id experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and the officer comes over and he says what happened and i said i got hit by this car and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i cant help but think thats karma thats a hit and run and hit and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes sign this and i said well what does it mean and he goes it means youre okay and that we can leave i was really shaken up i was like i dont know if im okay and he goes just sign it which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that youve just said no to and its unattractive but very effective you know i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours cause the other driver had beat us there and eventually were with the doctor and andy says to him he goes well was the other guy drunk and the doctor says well i cant answer that and andy says was he he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works you know the doctor says well hes heading to jail now and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys like case closed a few hours later were back at andys house its probably aroundin the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married and andy says mike sleep on it and i said no no no this makes perfect sense and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says mike sleep on it he saves methe next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed and im not making this upfor the repairs on the other drivers mercedes suv and i was like well this cant be happening i explained to the woman i think its a misunderstanding the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault and she said im really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money so i requested the accident report and im gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i dont know if youve ever seen one of these things before but its a little bit like homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consisten',\n",
       "  'tly mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says p1 thats me started to go but all of a sudden v1 thats me also came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now im pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other drivers statement at the scene of the accident was i was on venice going uh im not too sure i was going away from the beach i was driving i dont know what happened did i hurt anyone i dont know where i was going but i came from home i had a sip of beer which is really everyones favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right thats what they serve these days at the homebeachpubso all of its mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so im like i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know cause im calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows im trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and im so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car i know and i mean thats what i said i go arent you listening to any of this i go and this guy was clearly drunk i mean he nearly killed me inches from where he hit and i would be dead right now and he wants me to pay for his car dont you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and its just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law im on the phone with lawyers and private investigators theres only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no and he says did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no this isnt about money and he doesnt take the case and this is when i start going completely madim up to aboutoram every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who haveso now i know this guys name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller like jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia i was like im gonna track down jim bosworth im gonna sue jim bosworth and im gonna sue the entire los angeles police department at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me like hey whats going on id be like ill tell you whats going on id tell them this whole story and theyd be like you should get a lawyer id be like this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldnt even touch this cause he wouldntthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and shes talking to me but im not listening cause im writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin ive drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers im gonna call that week and im so angry im writing over my own handwriting to the point where im ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says what are you doing and i said well this is my case and she says well why dont you work on that in the morning and i said well which part of this napkin dont you understand jenny says mike youre right but its only hurting you and im just so glad that youre alive and i think that we should focus on that she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guys car july 7jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didnt believe in the idea of marriage and i still dont but i believe in her and ive given up on the idea of being rightthank you guys very much thank you thank you guys so much thanks for coming here

cheersthis is my first new standup for seven years if you dont count the golden globes which you shouldnt the golden globes\\xa0very different god a different vibe two hundred million people watching and its live big thrill but with that many people watching theres a bit of stick everyones different everyones a blogger everyone goes i was offended why he said an horrible thing he said loads of horrible things yeah but that was a thing that i care about thats the thing about offense its about personal feelings i dont care about the backlash comedian in hot water you know my girlfriend jane she worries and she reads things what have you said dont worry they wont come to the house fuck em so i wind her up i pretend im gonna say much worse things than i ever would i have to make up worse jokes than i actually just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before its in la we fly out im writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick i got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson ill introduce him yes about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said i got a good intro she went what i said bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren i didnt do it she said you wont do that i said no next day i got her again i said is this too much i said not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy i didnt do it i would never id never tell a joke like that its horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane id never even think of that so dont even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said ill start\\xa0with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke she went what i said what did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas jane went i dont know i said cancer i didnt do it so youre getting offended at a joke that doesnt exist so id never say that in public so to anyone who mattered anyway so dont i didnt have to worry about offending anyone it just happensthe big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going it was transphobic it wasnt transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and thats the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target theyre not necessarily the same ill tell you the joke you make your minds up its live so they go your host for the h annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais theyre all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously its brilliant right so i just go relax im gonna be nice tonight ive changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously and i go\\xa0now caitlyn jenner of course and what a year shes had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didnt do a lot for women drivers thats a clever joke ill tell you why right',\n",
       "  ' its layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes im playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying shes a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if shes a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car lets not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress thats the target of the joke just so were clear okay she was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers now cancelled and one of the press said what do you think of the ricky gervais joke she went maybe i should host the golden globes and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously i just sent back let her host just dont let her drive another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais i just sent back at last she always brakes too late bring it on bring it on but im a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying why is it transphobic they said its about a trans person thats ridiculous thats like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but im willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her id never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathlete\\xa0he was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big famous man with a huge i dont know im guessing probably he was big but ive learnt my lesson now i know its wrong id never deadname her now but years ago when she was a man years ago im saying and she went to the doctor and knocked on the door the doctor went come in this is years ago id never deadname her now but this is like a flashback before anyone you know what so so like come in and he went hello bruce jenner because that that was his name then the doctor– this was years ago the doctor went all right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy and bruce jenner– that was\\xa0his name this is years ago right so bruce jenner went yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah what can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy and bruce jenner went– that was his name bruce jenner went look at that the doctor went come on bruce jenner you know the rules he uses his whole name every time for some reason come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you cant bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate bruce jenner went no thats not my pole thats my enormous penis well seeing as its your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside and bruce jenner went that was his name for fiftyeight years i think he went no theyre not my shot puts doctor theyre my enormous testicles thats where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went oh yeah that makes perfect– im a medical man youre a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy youre a big youre big and you would have a big old cock and balls theyre beautiful bit familiar innit no you must be very proud of them bruce bruce went this is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them and the doctor went what why oh they get in the way in the way of what fucking driving for one thingso im engaging these people and im saying but i had to say her old name thats the joke i say ive changed not as much as bruce jenner then i do the joke but no this is my second crime i say she hasnt changed shes always identified\\xa0as a woman that means shes a woman fine if thats the rules if you feel youre a woman you are im not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i dont think its going far enough cause ive always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say im a chimp i am a chimp preop but dont ever deadname me dont call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo im gonna have species realignment im halfway there im short with short legs and long arms i stoop my backs getting hairier by the day ive got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like so i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say im a chimp ive got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy thatd be lovely im gonna stay a male chimp so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so you know i reckon thats got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp were so close than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off and a hole gouged out into– im not a doctor but that is the gist of it i know which one id rather have done im not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i cant see you but to me every single one of you is equal to a chimp so so i',\n",
       "  'd have all that done hair and that id do all that all the ill retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies im talking to jane shes going what is it what is it bobo you left the fucking oven on theres a fire are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole shed revert shed be over that fucking easy so id have all that done top lip doing all that right ill be legally a chimp ill be well properly chimpedup ill be able to use chimp toilets ill be walking along holding janes hand come on bobo right we dont hold hands now i dont know why shes all over me now im a chimp but well be all in love maybe matching jumpers come on bobo in love just two like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes thats fucking disgusting ill fling shit at him and run up a tree and thats why that joke isnt transphobic so cheersso humanity what is humanity what are we well weve touched upon it there were great apes not metaphorically were literally great apes we aregenetically identical to a chimpanzee were closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is our parents mate were born we grow we mate our parents die our friends die and then we die now my sevenyearold niece didnt like hearing that but i said youve gotta learn stop crying i said youre seven you know today so any more grizzling and this partys cancelled so lets take the first of those birth its odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early thats why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb thats why were so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes im proper pregnant right im gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes mum its got to be fucking ready were were helpless right just think nine months were growing in this perfect environment everythings its like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly youre being squeezed out of an hole near an ass youre covered in shit theres screaming you go i cant breathe someone goes yes you fucking can the first one second of life\\xa0on earthyou dont know where you are you cant choose where youre born i was\\xa0born in whitley estate in reading right i wouldnt have chosen that id have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took\\xa0 years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous its a rarefied place its like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i dont know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didnt get mugged or molested there werent many pedophiles\\xa0in reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god theres no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him bender it was weirdi know my life has changed drastically it wasnt always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying hes out of touch hes so famous hes rich hes megarich i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like hes an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary scum and i say i say dont call them scum right but even the papers they try and get around to it i do interviews and theyll always say do you always fly first class i go no often private right the number of times ive answered this question they say do you know how much a pint of milk is to make you look out of touch i dont know but thats irrelevant next time a journalist asks me ill say i dont know but heres\\xa0a grand run and get me one is that enough that enough yeahanother question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece theyre still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things like you dont have children i say no why dont you have children which is an odd question why dont you have children as opposed to asking people why do you have children lets ask the fat lady in the leggings why shes had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didnt even touch the sides or disturb her cigarette that one just go and claim for that people say its selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesnt exist on any level theres not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going we want to be born right but ive thought about it and theres three reasons i dont have children three main reasons and ill share them with you three reasons one theres millions the worlds overpopulated noones going ricks not having kids were gonna run out fuck two kids are scroungers arent they i mean from day one its all me me me isnt

like shes shes fucking beautiful its a minefield innitso im not out of touch but i am spoiled theres a difference i didnt have any money until i wasive got the same family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesnt take much il give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew were met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time youre horrified everyones looking pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went wheres that bloke im not queueing its quick when i fly to the states ive got a place there but im always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesnt get any better even if i was paying id still go first class but jane would probably be in coach its ten grand a pop that new planet of the apes movies on shell love that shell be up for that but when someone else is paying i say jane get up here with me right front two seats they board us early were on the plane aboutminutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne its great its like a day off no phone or anything its like\\xa0a holiday flying to the statesi could do without the safety video thats always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain atmiles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked youre going down the plane smashes you go ill try it you do that ball of flames you wake up everyones dead you go fucking hell thats amazing that is and they always use that voice dont they that calming hypnotic voice like nothing bad will happen theyre saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because im using this voice dont worry things like in the event of the plane landing on water– it smashes the fuck to bits right they say in the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyones dead except you by a miracle youre bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is youve got aboutminutes before hypothermia sets in or youre eaten by a shark or you drown youre hoping theyve sent airsea rescue youre going god im\\xa0gonna die i dont know what im doing hold on i mean air sea rescue i dont know if youve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter o course you havent but theyre fucking loud its like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle its like like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die rightbut apart from that its brilliant right i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round champagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais she goes off i go have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts she went were not handing out nuts on this flight a ladys getting on whos so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction i went oh my god of course i was fuming i mean whats that got to do with me why cant i eat nuts just cause fucking this woman will die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you if being just near a nut how has she never been near a nut before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly its and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean i never wanted nuts more i felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought oh i wish id brought my own nuts on right i thought for a second but that wouldnt work shed get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that and die and someone would go ricky gervais brought his own nuts on you know right so i dont take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over in nuts just in case then i go can i have any nuts they go no sorry this lady would

       "  'io moms against nuts right and she does a blog and theyre talking to each other and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am one filmed her little girl put it on youtube and sent me it i opened it sweet little girl seven years old and she went dear mr gervais i have a fatal nut allergy delete not my problem right ignore ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause im this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isnt as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said you should never make jokes about food allergies i should have left it right i sent back i make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and youre telling me i should never joke about food allergies she sent back yes\\xa0but the holocaust didnt kill children well it did didnt it it was horrible the holocaust some would say as bad as food allergies didnt kill children jesus it did kill children hitler killedmillion people many of them children i have to say hitler you couldnt make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible but if i was throwing a dinner party and id been slaving over a hot stove and i was getting everything ready and there was one place left and i had to either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies i know whod ruin that party more everyones enjoying it everything okay ja ist\\xa0yummy right hes loving it i go cheers you fucker how you doing boy shes going i cant eat that fucking hell who wants ferrero rocher me all right here i cant eat them oh fuck off home rightthats what the worlds like people see something they dont like they expect it to stop as opposed to deal with their emotions they want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do its why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think ive lived through the bestyears of humanitytothe peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now its going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybeim not saying this because im old old people say things like oh everything was better when i was a kid course it was you were a kid everythings better when youre a kid being old is the shit bit whatevers happening being old is i wake up these days and i go oh fuck i didnt die gotta do it all again im usually hung over headache liver pains i cant walk for the first five minutes cause ive got no joints in my knees im getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about \\xa0proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort ofyears were what i call my eating years and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was aboutyears old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor and i was saying to jane im having a heart attack right and honestly my heart rate was likei felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because id eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like python swallow a pig whole and then its just fucked its like itll sit there for a week its like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasnt having a heart attack but it worried jane she said you gotta look after yourself i thought youre rightso i started working out right every day i didnt give anything up i dont eat meat anymore but i was having calories\\xa0a day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lostpounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically cant\\xa0burn off the calories i cant do enough cause im so old and broken and tired so im going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to dieim losing my hair its getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right ill have to buzz that off soon id never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think youve got away with it you havent everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before i do right i could be at a party itll go theres a wig in here i go is there yes there is yeah spidey senses for the wig its obvious the way they smile like nothings wrong hiya its the telltale signs isnt it i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald great bloke hes dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house elvis what is– i was about eight i said to auntie edna what happened she went it was a miracle they were lying they were just everyone knew he was bald but hed embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well theyre going yeah it just grew back theres so much he',\n",
       "  ' wouldnt do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we werent allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said reg is allergic to balloons he wasnt allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room weve got photos in the family album if hes at a wedding or a christening and hes holding a baby its always at arms length like that so it cant grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasnt scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes cancer hows the chemo going uncle not a problem weve got a photo of him the last year i think he wasit must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it hes wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternitybut i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and ill and blind and deaf and shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket youre ready because youre warned you know about getting old what they dont talk about so youre not prepared and it was a shock to me i only found out recently ill share it with you now the distending testicles see you dont know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasnt checking them or anything i didnt see em foryears as a young man they were pert and now theyre like two plums in a sock i dont know when it happened but it was recently they just and this is how i found out so as ive been getting older and theyve been secretly stretching away as ive got older ive got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and theyre floating right now id never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like theyd be heavy you could tie things down with them and theyd sink you know most people never see their in the sea youre in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths arent usually that deep that was my first thought oh my god i never thought testicles would float then my second thought kicked in hold on this baths two feet deep right im sitting on the bottom theyre on top whats going on right and i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact theyd created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle im just thinking this is bizarre fucking hell right and i thought maybe its a fluke so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up theyre really theyre really buoyant right try it when you get home if youre in yourand a man obviously or caitlyn jennerbut but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media because twitter and facebook thats where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was like me agree with me it falls into two tribes i dont agree with them so i block them and now in this posttruth era people dont care about the argument they say whos saying the argument no theyre not on our side its ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion weve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now its my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying i believe the earth isyears old i believe youre a fucking idiot you cant have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didnt want to make a mistake and theres a ridiculous thing of lets ask the average person what they think lets stop asking the average person what they do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say do not drink right lets take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but its not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like tweet us your news dont let them tweet you the news i saw a tyrannosaurus rex you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said weve looked at everything and weve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so were going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldnt happen again that would have been it but the guy went we asked the public what they thought then there was three banal vox pops first one said i already pay £ a year so im not happy the next one said it takes meminutes each way its not good enough the last one said i say its better to arrive at work late than dead why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted youre in early ted oh ted weve been through',\n",
       "  ' this remember i said id rather you arrive late than deadbut the big enemy is stupidity right i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyones opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are stillcountries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say its fine to be an atheist its fine to believe in god and its fine not to thats all i was saying i realized i didnt have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people id tweet things like happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today someone would always go we know what youre fucking doing this is a tweet i got\\xa0after one of those and it was all in capitals which excited me thats the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger its great right i looked at his profile sure enough hes a gentleman from texas hes a fundamentalist creationist christian which is fine he loves god he loves god and fetuses mainly he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay and then hes remember its in capitals hes shouting at me best tweet ever your science– my science right science by the way is spelled scients already good isnt it i mean hes obviously heard the word he took a guess never seen it written down because its not in the bible so hes your scients wont help you well it will its helping him beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me your scients wont help you when satan of course he believes in satan why not he believes that god made the universe in six days youre not gonna say to him do you believe in satan and have him say bit farfetched why doesnt god kill satan thats what id ask him if i was wrong and i met god id go oh you do exist hed go yeah id go ive got a few fucking questions mate the first one would be why did you make chocolate kill dogs mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put the male gspot up the arse what what is wrong with you then id say why dont you kill satan and hed go what id go why dont you kill satan if he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff which you want i mean you do want– yes yeah you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy yeah why dont you kill him then because shut up your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass and hes got a point because if i die and i find myself in hell being raped by satan science has pretty much let me down but its this last line that he just throws away the line he signs off with makes this the best tweet ive ever received your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass ill be laughing so hes there too hes so hes a fundamentalist christian whos lived his life by the old and new testaments he dies he wakes up in hell right which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma oh my god im in hell oh my god why have you forsaken me im gonna be tortured for eternity he sees me getting raped and goes ha ha ha hes suddenly over it is he his days suddenly got a little bit brighter and like hes not next right so im getting raped right by the devil right hes just there you fucking atheist scum and im like that yeah whatever i assume it happens all eternity yeah yeah whatever like that i might say watch your hooves on my testicles and hed go why are they so distended and i go oh like youre brad pitt you know what i mean sorry are we talking or raping can we you lying fucking atheist hes probably bored fucking atheists every fucking day right his little gargoyle comes up satan he goes what and i go yeah what he goes theres a fundamentalist christian fuck this hed be on him like a ton of bricksso i got that tweet i loved it all i did was retweet right and just watch the fun people piling on going ah loser and hes fighting back really witlessly saying things like go fuck your sister you english faggot that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again its still all going off right its really funny im laughing at all the replies people saying things to him im scrolling down theres one tweet directly to me from this woman she says you find rape funny no no what no your mates find rape funny no listen right you find rape funny listen everyone listen right no i said to her i didnt tweet that she went you retweeted it to show hes an idiot but you must find it funny or amusing its not a frivolous thing i said no well its up to him isnt it he can do it now im arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but im fighting for his right to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because im so conscious of freedom of speech what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didnt say what you find jokes about rape funny she said what you find rape funny the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying it was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling thats never so i sent back you mean jokes about rape she said yes i went depends on the joke it fucking doesnt im going no it does it does it depends on the joke its about context\\xa0its about content what do',\n",
       "  ' you mean by a rape joke she said even a joke with the word rape in it is unacceptable i said thats ridiculous it depends what the joke is i tweeted that clip of me in the office going i think theres been a rape up there everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man whos so narcissistic hell say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i said\\xa0some jokes dont punch up or down they dont punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play\\xa0on words that dont really mean anything a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it ill tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says help ive been graped the policeman says do you mean raped she says no there was a bunch of them that is a rape joke right so and i even said to her no i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokes\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting id never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying well okay i see your point but still i will laugh at a joke with the word rape in it when noone in the audience has been raped i should have left it i just sent back what a weird door policy you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says can i just ask you a question yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you cant come in what why a lady says she wont laugh if youre in off you gothats what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly on twitter im not tweeting anyone im just tweeting i dont know whos following me ive gotmillion followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally thats like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying guitar lessons and you go but i dont fucking want guitar lessons whats this theres a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i dont fucking want any fine its not for you then just walk away dont worry about iti should say one thing in twitters defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally im very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to getsignatures on a petition standing outside tescos or something thats the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament ive been part of many campaigns through twitter when weve gotsignatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those whove retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no ones gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard ill tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say ban bullfighting someone always says what about the kids in syria what well im not giving you a choice you can do both im not saying throw that kid back in the hole theres a bull hereand theres one thing that i didnt want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter theres a thing called the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and its horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back its a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people dont really read it its a kneejerk people say racist i go what they go we eat pigs and cows in the west yep we do i dont but yeah i used to youre right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog its not about the species its what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and theyre skinning this dog alive its screaming theyre laughing its the worst thing ive ever seen i thought ive got to tweet that i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said one beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said is that language necessary i should have left it right but i was i was incensed i said youre more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death she said i just hate the cword i definitely should have left it i sent back people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didnt go round acting like such cunts thank you youve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so muchi hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do thats not the point ive always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think its my upbringing i grew up in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized hes healing them thats what comedys for what humors for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much eve',\n",
       "  'rything was just to see if he could break this poor mans will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and hed get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought hed won the argument and hed tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought if it looked\\xa0respectable wed be respectable it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read is that pedophile postman still reading your mail and shed take it shed go in and shed be horrified shed call bob he saw it this time you must stop doing that even at her funeral my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mums funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right wed never been to church he didnt know us we didnt know him so he said to bob tell me about your mum so i can say a few words bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said well she was a keen racist the vicar went i cant say that bob said okay put she liked gardening he was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didnt warn us and he did get something by the vicar so were called ricky robert– bob– ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out hes a standup guy larry so bob gives the vicar the wrong name didnt warn us were all in church start of the funeral were all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and we snort like that right bobs going everyone realizes were all laughing we see larry go all right and the church is like every time we thought of it wed see larry go like that right then wed just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicars thinking what have i said right hed put in a few things the vicar didnt know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying id come prepared with a pack of tissues theyd take one and hand it on before the funeral id taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said snivelling fucking bitch and theyre sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we all\\xa0started fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said sorry was that okay me and bob went\\xa0fucking brilliant\\xa0mate it was fucking brilliant thats what i mean were all\\xa0gonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity youre bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny youve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well it might go badly but youve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right so were all in the car one day bobs driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and theres a british bobby there and he stops the car bobs at the window he said where are we off to bob went bognor he went\\xa0can you just pop the boot please so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bobs window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet ofcigarettes and the copper went bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets and bob went i knew it wasnt fucking brains youve

       "  'y men who are here were any of you like little gay boysyeah you you know the gay boys im talking about weve all seen the little gay boys like the kids at the park that are just like i dont want to play hes like over twerking by the slide his dads trying to throw the ball with him and its like just stop it its not going to catch okay we know little gay boys exist which means little lesbians also exist but you never see a little lesbian because lesbians live in the shadows i want to see a little lesbian you know just a little girl like aggressively eating a muffin she doesnt know why shes doing it shes like i got to practice i got to really get in there and i think women we really fucked up we befriended gay men i dont think that was the right choice i think we shouldve befriended lesbians lesbians would be like come on we found a way to run a successful society instead we befriended gay men and theyre like bitch youre uglyand were like hes my best friend i like him cause hes mean to me in a different way and theres not like not that many prominent lesbians you know even now sometimes youll hear about lesbians like youll find out theyre a lesbian after they died like men will be like oh i thought she was just miserable and alone and its like no she lived with that lady yeah i know i thought they were miserable and alone together cause i think its still hard for straight men to sometimes believe that women can be happy without a man and i think even straight women i think even we know that thats possible and now we have the luxury to decide if we want to get married or not that used to not be the case you used to always have to get married im sure there were some women that like during world war ii their husband went off to fight in the war and then he died and they were like oh no no im too heartbroken i can never marry again this bed is bigand also for the longest time i think straight men they always wanted lesbians to be like two hot young women who would maybe like invite them to join and lesbians were like no thats not who were gonna be there was always at least one lesbian in a couple who looked like she knew how to like build a deck and that made sense to me that couple made sense to me because i knew who was doing the work now there is the emergence of the young hot lesbian couple and it doesnt make any sense to me because i have no idea whos doing any work hot women dont have to work i cant figure it out it just seems like its going to be two women lying in bed waiting for some',\n",
       "  'thing to happen to them like when theres a burglar whos going down and also whos going down i know the answer for gay men its both of you for both those things youre both going down on each other and youre both going down to the burglar to see if he wants to come up like oh you brought zip ties good we were already playing hostage but my biggest the reason ive been so fascinated with lesbians i think it actually comes from a jealousy im jealous of the lesbian relationship because you get to be a wife but you also get a wife that seems super productive i want to be a wife but i dont i dont get a wife i get a husband and whats he going to do whats he gonna do in this almost equal society we fought so hard for what protect me from who hes the guy most likely to kill meand so the fact is you know the reason i moved to barcelona as a strong independent woman was for a boyand being in love and being happy is the worst thing thats ever happened to me uh i was before this i was always single and i was miserable and it made sense and i knew why now im happy and im in love and its terrifying because it could go away at any point but i actually think this is the key to a successful relationship never feel secureno matter how long youve been in a relationship always think your partner could leave cause then youre never too mean like i treat my guy like an indooroutdoor cat im like you can go but theres good food hereand ive been learning a lot of terrible things about myself in this relationship like um i i learned that apparently im a nurturer like uh despite any of my wishes uh i like to do things for him like cook for him and do his laundry which is insane because i dont like to do my own laundry this is everything you need to know about why women arent ahead were just willing to do nice stuff for other people because it makes us feel good i didnt want this to be my life i didnt know cooking and doing laundry for a man would do something like bring me joy but it does i love to do it i love to take care of him its really lovely i started using fabric softener because of him i never used fabric softener before because i thought fabric softener was a scheme i thought it was a scheme by big laundry to just get us to use another liquid and so ive never used it before and one day he comes up to me and he approached me about this like anyone does who like wants something to keep happening you know he was like hey baby i love you so much do you ever notice our clothes are a little bit crunchyand when ',\n",
       "  'i hear crunchy clothes the first thing i think of is semen right but i know thats not why these clothes are crunchy cause i know where all the semen is going you know guys dont be gross in the trash can which is what i call my vaginathis is a this is just a tiny peek into a comedians life i riffed that joke on stage one night and i liked it so much that i was like id rather keep calling my vagina a trash can than not do that joke so the clothes are crunchy and its not cause of the semen because thats in old trash can over here hes like ever notice our clothes are crunchy i was like yeah i have noticed and he was like maybe we could start using fabric softener and then i went on my whole fabric softener is a scheme rant and he didnt leave you know so i thought that was pretty good and so i bought fabric softener and i started using it and you know what happens when you put fabric softener onto the clothes that you then put on your body it makes them softer its a perfectlynamed product i shouldve been using it this whole time know what i blame i blame the marketing theyre marketing this product wrong you got to get rid of that gay snuggie bear hes gay right him and the pillsbury doughboy theyre gay theyre theyre just out there touching tummies you know what fabric softener needs know what mascot fabric softener needs a sturdy lesbian just a sturdy lesbian on the cover being like it works okay and im not used to a lot of the stuff that comes with relationships he says very romantic and sweet things to me you know like hell say things like i could just look into your eyes forever you have the most beautiful eyes which to be honest made me feel okay about my body you know like just my eyes okay uh then i do the very girly thing that we sometimes do id be like well what happens when i get old and uh like my i hopefully age terribly you know and you know everything starts falling apart hes like i dont care i could look into your eyes forever theyre so beautiful i absolutely love staring into your eyes which is like a really sweet thing to say but then i thought of one more question i wanted to ask him but i didnt ask it because theres only one right answer and i knew if he didnt say the right answer id have to leave the question i wanted to ask was okay so what if someone plucked out my eyes and i just had two sockets then what would you do i didnt ask that question cause theres only one right answer and the right answer is walk away quietlycause thats the funniest way to leave a newly blind',\n",
       "  ' person is are you still there i feel your energy and it is you know like oh i should mention the guy im in a relationship with hes a black man and the only reason im telling you that is so you know im a good person uh its really relevant for the next couple jokes they dont work as well if hes not black uh there was one night i got home and he was asleep on the couch and the tv was on and i dont know what he fell asleep to but when i came in there was a video playing about white privilege i was like this is the most passiveaggressive thing ive ever seen like im the white woman in this relationship im the passiveaggressive one how are you supposed to how dare you try to outwhitewoman me so i did the whitestwoman thing i could think of i called the police and now hes dead so im kidding we live in spain they dont do that there they just give you an olive and make you take a nap but you know its been really great and actually not just this relationship but everything over the past couple years its really taught me we should always lead with love and kindness no matter what the relationship youre in your friends your family strangers especially strangers we should always lead with love and kindness and of course were gonna argue of course were gonna disagree and hopefully those arguments never get too bad but no matter what happens you should always try to be the first person always try to be the first person to say why are you yelling cause if you say that youve won and thats what its really all about if you want itive got itif you need itive got it part 2 all struggles matterme too hi guys how are youits fine i dont really carei always like being here in philadelphiai love being here in denver you guys you know you have a good town always happy to be here in salt lakei love coming to madison i love being back herethis is gonna be fun were gonna have a good timeive been noticing lately that a lot of comedians have been using their time on stage to talk about their struggles and how they identify and i think thats good for comedyum guys this is serious soguys im about to talk about my struggles i thought you know i could use my platform here to talk about how i struggle and how i identify you remember likeyears ago this commercial would come on that would be like do you have the urge to move your legs at night do you get a creepy crawly feeling in your legs you might have restless leg syndrome well it turns out i have restless leg syndrome and you know how i got diagnosed with restless leg',\n",
       "  ' syndrome i listened to those symptoms and then i go yes i have it theres no cure and it is you get this like itchy kind of feeling in your legs at night you feel like you have to move them which also i mean even just to have this disease calling it a disease is a bit of a stretch its kind of like the white women of diseases you know where youre like is it a problem i dont like even to recognize that you have it you have to have a lot of time to rest i was just relaxing at home for hours when my legs were like move its either restless legs or its like prediabetes like its your body being like take a lapand its hard the more you talk about it kind of like the more like unbelievable it actually sounds like if there was a gofundme for restless leg syndrome and a cat who needed a wheelchair i think that cats getting a wheelchair we dont even know if he has restless legs cause he doesnt have anyoh dont be sad about a fake cat that i just made up and like this is not a great thing to complain about in the best of times but like were not in the best of times you know like were just out of pandemic people cant find baby formula gas is likean ounce meanwhile im like sometimes at night i have to wiggle my legs because of the itchys and the scratchys so i guess what id like to do tonight is id like to come out as insufferableyeahi feel validated because this black man just raised his glass to me and weunderstand suffering it has it has it has been a really hard time for white women i mean not literallylike a lot of people are coming out and talking about their struggles and white women are really trying to be a part of that its been kind of hard for us to do you know cause its hard to have like a struggle and a skin care routine like things are hard i did this joke the other night and a white lady screamed out she goes youre going the wrong way shes really having a hard time but i thought about it and i think white women i think i figured out what our struggle is i think our struggle is hearing how hard it is for other people is really hard for us like like we heard how hard it was for black people and we were devastated we saw pictures of the destruction in ukraine and we needed a social media break we heard about the crimes against humanity in palestine and we didnt really get into that one cause thats not one of the in crises but in general hearing how hard things are for other people has been really hard for us so hard we can barely make our own jewelryand like we blame a lot of stuff on whi',\n",
       "  'te men you know and women you have done a lot of stufflike dont even get mad about it youve been really terrible but youre really good at it you know like white men came over from europe annihilated a civilization and then rebranded it as thanksgiving thats like pretty impressive you know and we blame a lot of stuff on you guys which is very funny to me because we act like we havent participated in it at all and we have participated at the most fundamental of levels we made youwere like the guy who made the atom bomb and were like but dont use it youd think weve spent all this time with white men you would think we would have picked up some tips and tricks by now you know you guys have the blueprint its like we havent learned anything its like we spent our whole life with michael jordan and only walked away with a bad gambling habit i think one of the reasons its been hard for us to get ahead is because white women we want to we dont want to give up being the victim you know but we also want to be in charge we want to be the head victim in charge you know we want to be the manager but we also want to be able to ask for the manager like i need to speak to the manager oh no thats me and im a bitch and were really good at being the victim you know were good at it like were the bride of victims no matter whats happening to other people were like no no its my dayand my dads kind of paying for the whole thing so and sometimes i get a bit frustrated with white women because by the way this whole section is gonna be about you white women if you havent picked that up yet so if youre starting you know starting to take offense dont worry just cross your arms this is not what i came here for sometimes i feel like were waiting for things to be nice for us you know because ive said it before you know white women we are oppressed sexism definitely exists you know but white men you guys were smart you kept us comfortable it was a very airconditioned oppression like you know again i dont want to downplay what happens to women you know like obviously sexism exists a lot of women get murdered and assaulted um by like you know okay so i looked up the statistics for this um for the joke not because i caredbut of the women who get murderedof them get murdered by someone they knowof that is by their husband so not are we getting murdered were getting murdered by the people who we love the most you know and then i heard about all these trans women getting murdered and assaulted and all i could think of when ',\n",
       "  'i heard that was welcome jump on in the water is terrible and full of missing womensome people will say no statistically more trans women are getting murdered im like are they getting murdered cause theyre trans or are they getting murdered cause theyre not used to presenting as a woman you know like i can understand if theyre getting murdered someones murdering them theyre like this is cause youre transby the way sorry im im stabbing the person i just looked at myself doing that i was like it looks like okay im not jerking the person off its a very different situation this is cause youre trans its a fun surprise you know technically maybe you could murder someone that way i dont know probably take a whileyoure almost out you know what im saying i no this is a knife and im stabbing this this is cause youre trans if thats how theyre getting murdered okay yes its because theyre trans or you know is it because theyre not used to presenting as women and theyre doing you know stuff they shouldnt be doing like walking home at night like you used to be a lion now youre a gazelle theres different rules bitch okay you cant do everything you used to be able to do you cant just hang around vans like what what happened did you speak up in a meeting or did you do the most dangerous thing of all did you marry the love of your life so i understand i understand when women are unhappy with society you know it makes sense to me but youre unhappy with society do something about it you know all i see is these white women karening and thats really frustrating to me first of all karening isnt new karenings been happening since the beginning of time you guys just finally started recording it like theres literally like cave paintings of karens its just a woman whos like youre not supposed to have a fire here karening frustrates me cause its such an ineffective use of your power you know like when white men are unhappy with society they really do something about it they really get in there you know they run for office they change laws they gerrymander they get their hands dirty you know when were unhappy with society we dont do that we just like knock over a display in target its so frustrating i think sometimes we think that like you know as individuals we cant create change and you can just you as an individual you can create change i see men do it all the time women you can do it on your own you know like um ted kaczynski wasnt happy with society and you know what he did he built a perfectly symmetrical ca',\n",
