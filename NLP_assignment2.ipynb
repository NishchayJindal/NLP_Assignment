It premiered on HBO on April 13, 2013. Filmed in Phoenix, Arizona at the Celebrity Theatre\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIntro\\nFade the music out. Let’s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all.\\n“The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n“My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”\\n“The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n“Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.\\n“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”\\n“Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n“Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”\\n“Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”\\n“First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.\\n“Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!”\\n“Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.\\n“Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!”\\n“Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending.\\n“Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.\\n“If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n“Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks. You guys were great. Thank you very, very much.

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen.\\nI don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!”\\nThis went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.\\nThat would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that.\\nI’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones.\\nIt doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots.\\nEverybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off.\\nI’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell.\\nIt’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.\\nA couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.\\nUh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.\\nI knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars.\\nAnd then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…”\\nAnd then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.”\\nHe was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them.\\nI know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out.\\nThe second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that.\\nSome people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect.\\nWe’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was.\\nBut if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated.\\nAnd then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off.\\nIf Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit.\\nYou know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in.\\nSomebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.”\\nThey’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening?\\nWait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.”\\nThe third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.”\\nWell, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike.\\nI remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us.\\nMy point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way.\\nI used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest.\\nHowever, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.”\\nAnd then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too.\\nThe ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure.\\nYeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works.\\nCan’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian.\\nObviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough.\\nYou guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true.\\n“♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪\\n♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪\\n♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪\\n♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪”\\nAnd his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪”\\nYou know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money.\\nLet’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

I forgot. The fourth time I met OJ Simpson. The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end.

Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you.\\nWhat a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up.\\nSo… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers.\\nThis is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens.\\nThe big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!”\\nSo, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers.\\nSo, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth.\\nYou don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird!\\nI know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah.\\nAnother question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.”\\nI did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit?\\nSo… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right?\\nBut apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free.\\nSo I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe.\\nI’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die.\\nI’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity.\\nBut I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner.\\nBut… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead?\\nBut… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks!\\nSo… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go.\\nThat’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!”\\nAnd there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much.\\nI hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went,\\xa0“Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nRicky Gervais, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 thought on “Ricky Gervais: Humanity (2018) | Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKen Wheelchair 22/03/2018 at 00:35  \\n\\n\\nProlefeed.\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that’s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I’m at the end of the tour right now. I’m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So… [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she’s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and I’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and I don’t see it getting better. Um… I’ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “Oh, I used to party with Madonna.” And I went, “You fucking what, when?” And she went, “I used to party with Madonna.” Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I’m not bragging. I didn’t get the model years. I didn’t get those years. I’ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um… So, I said, “So you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” And she went, “No, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” I go, “You need to elaborate on this story right now.” And she goes, “Oh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.” As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, “That’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” That’s a big one. “That’s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.” So she said, “I used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna’s house.” And she goes, “This one time, the four of us were over at Madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” And then I went, “Shut the fuck up!” And she went, “What?” I said, “I know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! You all started fucking each other!” And she went, “We did. We started…” “Just shut up!” And she goes, “What do you care for?” I said, “You’re the mother of my child! I don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ NBA player while you’re licking out Madonna’s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [Moaning] And she goes, “Oh, you’re being silly. What do you care for? You’ve partied way more than I have in my life.” And I went, “That is not true. I’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn’t call it a party.” For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It’s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We’re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, “Well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [Chuckles] I don’t… You know, I’ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I’ve had good nights out, but I’ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? I’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It’s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just… They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they’re going, “No, dude. Use the table. Don’t use your…” And I go, “Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um…” And it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring ’em in like, “Huh?” And you can do this. You can go… “Uh…” Like that. And they’ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.” When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.” And that’s a vastly different emotion that… I don’t think women will never… Yeah, okay.\\nThis is the thing. In America, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “And still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” And of course, that’s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like… a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don’t actually mean, but this is something I’m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I’m sorry. I… [Audience whooping] I’m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. I’m sure they do. I’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. What I’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now… I’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.” And don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. Right? We do. But there’s little things in society that you can’t change. Men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. There’s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine’s Day is just for women. They say it’s for romantics. They say it’s for couples or something like that. It’s just for women. There’s no man who gets excited by Valentine’s Day. There’s no man that when he sees the Valentine’s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “Oh, Valentine’s Day is coming!” Valentine’s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “How much money do I have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” It doesn’t stop there. Mother’s Day! Mother’s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend’s first Mother’s Day. And she went, “Oh, I wonder what I’ll get for Mother’s Day.” And I went, “Probably fucking nothing. He’s got no money. He’s six months old. What do you think he’s gonna buy you?” Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother’s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause I assumed that’s what Hank would have wanted her to have… and I wrote a card. I’m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I’m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] “Happy Mother’s Day. Love, Hank.” And I went, “H-A-N…” And then I did the “K” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. See, now I know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “Well, fathers have Father’s Day.” Father’s Day is bullshit. It’s fucking shit, Father’s Day. Father’s Day came around and my girlfriend went, “What do you want for Father’s Day?” And I went, “I don’t want anything. Don’t even worry about it. I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on. You gotta have something.” I said, “Honestly, I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on.” And I went, “It’s my fucking money. Just don’t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.” That’s why every single father has that one Father’s Day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! It’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “I heart Dad.” And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go… “That cost me nothing, that mug.” [Audience whooping] See… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I’ve got it, right? April 18th… Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It’s good, isn’t it? Everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It’s nice. A month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “Oh, the decorations are up!” [Men whooping] And it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine’s Day when they don’t get a gift. You could go like, “Oh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. They’ve, uh…” I’m thinking, I don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I’m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting “Jim Jefferies” on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, “April 18th.” ‘Cause it’s good, right? You’re in a bar. You’re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go… Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt.\\nThe weird thing is I’m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I’m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it’s a much more… I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex… Oh, you know… I do it. I get involved, ’cause I feel like I have to. You know, I… But I’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh… When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… But the thing is, you can’t smell porn. You don’t smell porn. You just… You just watch it. They never… And it’s different, porn. It’s different. They clean the girl’s asshole. They pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. I’m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She’s like… You’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “Put it in my ass.” She’s inviting. It’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. And then she’s like… She says things… I don’t know, things like, “I’m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.” And… And the experience I’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I’ve… My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… It’s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “I’m gonna act like I enjoy it.” She does that whole, “Yeah. Oh, no, that’s good.” [Moaning] Ahh! ♪ I’m having a good time ♪ And then they’re always going, “Are you done? Are you close to done?” You never fuck a pussy and they go, “Are you almost done? Finish this.” Like that. If you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don’t know how much they get paid. I’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. It’s the opposite bit of society. Um… But they do a thing called “ATM.” I don’t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for “ass to mouth.” That’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “I love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.” And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [Applause] she’s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. Now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “Well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering]\\nSo… I’m a father. Um… I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. He’s a good little boy. No, he’s a great little fella. I really like him. Um… My girlfriend super loves him, though. It’s fucking creepy. And… I’m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn’t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn’t fuck it. I… I just don’t get along with women. You know how it is. I don’t want them in my house, and… So… Because you dream, see… For example, okay? When Hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “Aw, that’s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.” That’s what I think… ‘Cause that’s what I think about my son. I hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. I don’t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “Oh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you’re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” Right, you know… And it’s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. They’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it’s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “Uh, uh!” Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, “Everyone, my boyfriend’s here. Here’s my boyfriend. Give him here. He’s my boyfriend.” And then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ It’s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl… Let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “Hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. Give her here. Give her here. She’s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She’s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don’t worry about a thing.” [Applause] [Cheering] So… Also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It’s just little things. Even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. There’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. I don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. ‘Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don’t give a shit. Fucking… My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I’ve got shit on my dick, I’ll ring me mate Jason up and go, “Hey, Jason… It’s happened again. I got shit on my dick.” And he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “Oh, I can’t wait to call Karen.” [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you… When my girlfriend got pregnant… When you meet… When you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “It is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.” And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “You’re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It’s over. You’re not gonna sleep.” They’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I’ve had girlfriends. That’s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “Fuck it! Let’s have a kid.” Fucking did it, right? These other people, man… You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “We’re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?” And you wanna say, “No, you’re really boring and we hate you.” But you go, “Oh, okay, great. You’re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.” And… And then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “We have to see how our careers are going and shit.” And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “From our family to yours.” And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “What the fuck is this shit?” And they’re like, “We had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.” And you go, “Well, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control…” And then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “What’s happening? A new person.” And they’re like, “Fuck off. We don’t love you anymore. We’re going.” And they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you’re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I’m not saying ’cause they look the same. I’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going… “Yolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.” [Jeffries chuckles]\\nI’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh… Gun control. Now… No, wait. Before you… Don’t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, “Yeah! Do it, Jim!” No, let’s just… [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I’m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the… Oh, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like guns, right? I’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn’t been beaten. And… Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. I don’t know how or why this happened, uh… Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, “That’s it! No more guns!” And we all went, “Yeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.” Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “Maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my guns!” [Whooping] So, here’s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It’s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “Fuck off. I like guns.” It’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. And there’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing wrong with saying, “I like something. Don’t take it away from me.” But don’t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] “I need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.” Really? Is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? Is it? I’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, “Well, that’d never happen to me.” You don’t know that, because you know what?\\n♪ From time to time We all get sad ♪ \\n♪ One day you’re happy Then you’re sad ♪ \\n♪ And then, uh-oh ♪\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] “Well, imagine if you had a gun.” And I’m like, “All right. I was naked at the time. I wasn’t wearing my holster. I wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.” What world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? You have guns ’cause you like guns! That’s why you go to gun conventions! That’s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “Fucking yeah!” Like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, “That’d never happen in my house ’cause I’m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.” Then they’re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you’re like, “Wait there, fuck-face! Oh! You’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I’m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother’s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother’s birthday? Maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [In whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, “None of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” I… I think they’re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] “Oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” And then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “You’re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.” Then she’d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “Why don’t they like me?” Let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, “Oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” They go, “We’ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.” Yeah, that’ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and… [Mimicking machine gun] And you’ve got Kevin. Now, I’m sure Kevin’s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don’t agree with me. Don’t think I don’t. Out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They’re looking around, going, “Wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” And then… there’s the last 10%. And they’re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. Just… And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I’m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “If you don’t like it, go home! If you don’t like it, go home!” And my answer to that is, “No.” I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I’ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And… unless you’re an American Indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It’s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don’t know what it says. I’ve never seen it. If there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. And don’t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had… Fucking, I get it, right? I’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I’m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] “You cannot change the Second Amendment!” And I’m like, “Yes, you can. It’s called an ‘amendment.'” If you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don’t think your constitution is set in stone. You’ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, “Hey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let’s get that one out. Let’s get that one out.” You used to have this other thing in America called, uh… slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, “That’s it. No more slaves!” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my slaves!” And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “Why should I have my slaves taken off me? I’m a responsible slave owner. I’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I… I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!” That’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me? I’ve done nothing wrong.” Look, I agree with you. If you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that’s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! “Oh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.” Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can’t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “Thanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” See, that’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me, I’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” Who’s to say you’re not crazy? That’s the thing about crazy people. They don’t know they’re crazy. That’s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, “I think, therefore I am.” You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that’s it. Right now, I think I’m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That’s what I think I’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] “I hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.” [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, “Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It’ll be delivered to your house. That’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. You’ve got $34,000. You’re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger’s as fuck. Right? I don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] “Guns! Who wants to sell me a gun?” Now, I’m gonna wrap this up. We won’t talk about it anymore. Now… See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with… That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [Audience cheering] – Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You’re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I’m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets… Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what’s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “Fuck you, buddy! Ah, you’re not a bad guy. You’re all right.”\\nNow… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause I don’t behave myself in there, so I’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘Cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like… Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That’s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “Hey, ladies. He’s a fireman.” And he comes out with his hose and like that… And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “You can’t take care of your kids.” It’s… And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don’t know… I don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. There’s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… That’s what a private “dance” is, right? I don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can’t imagine that there would be. I don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… She goes, “How was it?” And she goes, “Well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.”\\nSo Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. It was… I’m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… Now… The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He’s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now… the great thing about DJ is… he already looks disabled. He has that “latter stages of AIDS” thing going on. It’s great for casting. Anyway, but… I didn’t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors’ Union of America said, “You cannot do that.” Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, “All right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, “Can you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?” So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don’t know why. Maybe they’re just lazy. They don’t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I’d ever seen in my life. He was like… Think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of… [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and I’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, “Thank you so much for coming in.” And then we did the dialog together, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, “That’s our guy. That’s who we gotta pick.” And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought… “If he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” So he comes in… He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, “Whoa! What’s going on there, kicky?” And he goes… “Oh, you got me! I’m not disabled.” And I said, “You’re fucking what now?” And he goes, “I’m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.” And I said, “Just shut up. So let me… This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” And he went… “Yeah.” And I said, “You’re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.” And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and I’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and I just think, “I’m gonna call this guy up. I’m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?” And I’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like… And I thought, “This has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” The shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [Mimicking camera shutter] Like… [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “This guy’s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!” Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I’m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “Ta-da!” And we would have gone, “That was very good.” But I’ll tell you what you don’t do. Don’t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, “You did very good.” He’s like, “Thank you, Jim.” [Laughing]\\n[Chuckles] I was, uh… I go to a therapist… ’cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “I’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, “Red,” and I went, “Blue.” And then she went, “Cooking,” and I went, “Food,” and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went… For the last question, she went, “And what’s your favorite thing in the world?” And I went… “Coming on a girl’s face.” Now… Now, I could’ve said things like… “Ice cream” is a good answer. “Hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. But I said, “Coming on a girl’s face.” And I’ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. – I… – [Cheering] I’m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl’s on her knees and you… It’s so… And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, “When a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” There was never that… never that moment. But, by golly, if it’s not fun. I find it… To… Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, “Bravo!” Don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, “And here’s the women who take a load on their face.” And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “God bless you, ladies.” [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the… Like that… I don’t know why, but I enjoy… I know it’s a lie. I know you’re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it’s such a, “Oh, jeez, I’m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there’s a good chance I’ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.” But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I’m like, “You fucking slut… Oh, I love you. Ah… Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um… Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh… All right, I’m going to get a towel. I’ll get a towel. I’ll get you a towel. All right. You’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See… this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I’m there wiping come off his mother’s face.\\nI think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I’m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “Argh!” Like that. And I went… [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, “Hello, Hankie.” And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, “I love my daddy. Love, Hank.” But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the “K,” and… then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, “G’day, Hankie!” And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don’t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I’ve been telling everyone. And I can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He’s been training for this his entire life.\\nI think I’ve, uh… I think I’ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, “Oh, I think like an American person now.” And I’m happy to do it. I just… I’ll tell you what happened. I was flying around… I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I’m so used to airports and stuff here in America that… Okay, what happens is, when you go… I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don’t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “Tickets, please.” And I’m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. ‘Cause I get through airports quick, man. I’m like, “Fucking there you go.” And she went, “Put your ID away. I don’t need to see that.” And I went… “I think you do.” And she went, “I don’t… Why would I need to see your ID?” And I said, “I might be a terrorist.” And she went, “Would showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?” “No, I’d probably still blow the plane up.” So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I’m so good at the airports. I’m already taking my shoes off as I’m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I’m American, and they’re losing their fucking shit. They’re like, “Oh, for fuck’s sake! One of these cunts, eh?” And the TSA guy goes, “Hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” And I went… [Shouting] “I don’t know! Maybe they’re bombs?” And he went… “But they’re not, are they?” I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone’s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “Jeez, mate. That’s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?” “It might also be a bomb.” And then the guy said the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. He went… “Oh, come on, mate. You wouldn’t have two bombs.” [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense.\\nAll right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You’re fucking missing out, mate. If you don’t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine’s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone… He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine’s Day, right? Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running’s their second sport. You wouldn’t have thought that. Anyway… I’m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here’s the difference. Picture my accent, but I’m punching a black person. What I’m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So… she’s coming out of the shower. She’s been drying her hair. She’s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He’s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] “What the fuck is this? I’ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.” And she’s like, “Oh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?” “Who am I? I’m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That’s who the fuck I am.” “Well, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [Audience exclaiming] – I know. [Audience laughing] “Oh! Fuck you!” “No! Fuck you! I’m leaving you!” And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “You fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day… that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don’t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!” That’s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. “Oh, you’re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.” She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn’t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar’s one of the few men on Earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so… Boing! Ah! So… I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now… in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look… I’ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. I’ve never raped a man, but… if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. Like, “You want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?” There’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He’s the hero.\\nAll right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, – I thank you very much for coming. – [Audience groaning] No, I said, “soon,” not “over.” It’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always… I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I’m going to go, “Fucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.” [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don’t think I’ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don’t know if I’ll be invited this time. They’ll be like, [In South African accent] “We don’t like him. He’s no good.” Anyway, so, I’m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You’ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um… But it was all right ’cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn’t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice ’cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I’ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. So… I’m wearing a white T-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, “Hello,” and the lady goes, [In South African accent] “Oh, Mr. Jefferies, I’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” I said, “You what now?” She goes, “Business class is full. You have been downgraded.” And I said, “I understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.” And she went, “I’m sorry, sir. There’s nothing I can do.” And then I just went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” Now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” And she went, “Please do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!” And I said, “Are you, a white South African, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” Anyway… tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] “What is wrong here? What is wrong?” And I said, “I bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.” And he goes, “What do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can’t do anything.” He goes, “I’ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, “There’s nothing I can do.” So I walk off with my ticket. I’m walking through the airport like, “Fucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, “Tickets, please.” And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] “I’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” And I said… [Inhales sharply] “I bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “Next.” [Audience exclaiming] “Listen here, you fucking cunt.” [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, “Don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” And I said, “I want to speak to Simon Fulcher,” like I’m… And they go, “All right.” They ring the manager up, and then they go… He goes, “Is it the pale Australian man?” And the guy went, “Yes.” He goes, “We’ve had problems with him. Let him through.” Right? So I go through. I’m sitting there, I’m eating my peanuts. And I’m just angry now, going, “Fucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking…” Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all… And whenever I see Americans abroad… I’ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. You’re just walking around going, [In American accent] “Oh, this is great! Look at that. That’s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what’s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.” Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] “Did anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.” And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, “You can fuck off and all! You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve been downgraded!” And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “Fucking downgraded!” And the woman in the group was doing this, “Don’t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?” And all the men in the group were like, “Hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.” ♪ It doesn’t matter These people seem very angry, so ♪ And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] “Hey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.” And then I thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and I said, “Look, mate, don’t worry about it. It’s not like it’s your fault.” And I said, “Why are you in such a big group anyway?” And he goes, “Oh, we’re in Neil Diamond’s band. That’s Neil Diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and I reacted like he was one. I went, “Neil Diamond!” And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] “Hey, what’s going on?” And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, “Neil! Me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” And Neil went, “Oh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.” “You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!” And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don’t know if you have the Internet, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. “Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!” Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let’s have a drink. Bye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJim Jefferies, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.”\\nYou’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.”\\nIt’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?\\'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around.\\nI talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?”\\nMy wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.”\\nI grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.\\'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.”\\nMy wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.”\\nI have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.”\\nI loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!”\\nI didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo.\\nIt’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was.\\nAnd there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.”\\nKids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.”\\nNo, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.”\\nMy dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.\\'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero.\\nThe weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.”\\nWhat are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy.\\nI was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.”\\nI temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.\\'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy.\\nThat’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it.\\nI wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.\\nThat is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president.\\nAnd I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton.\\nMy mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton.\\nNow, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later?\\nSo, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!”\\nI learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!”\\nAnyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service.\\nWe land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life.\\nAnd I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992.\\nLet’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.\\nGood night, Chicago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJohn Mulaney, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.”\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!”\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.”\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.”\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!”\\n♪ A whole new world ♪\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.”\\nI’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!”\\nI don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore.\\nI’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.”\\nI can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody.

Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not.\\nI love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it.\\nI love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all.\\nNow, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny.\\nNow, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits…\\nDo you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do.\\nI of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot.\\nYeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it.\\nI once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me.\\nI hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it.\\nI get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday?\\nI had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets.\\nYou guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans.\\nI assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them.\\nI like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end.\\nMan, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing.\\nLast year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.”\\nI never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony.\\nYou. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky.\\nThe other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend.\\nI’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them.\\nYou guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny.\\nI think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink.\\nYou’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking.\\nI’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer?\\nIt’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich.\\nAnd who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.”\\nMy grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on.\\nBut I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.”\\nThank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself.\\nI like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?”\\nNo. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand?\\nNow I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.”\\nThis might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAnthony Jeselnik, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t4 thoughts on “Anthony Jeselnik: Thoughts And Prayers (2015) – Full Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuca 20/02/2022 at 01:56  \\n\\n\\nThis man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAriel 30/03/2022 at 06:11  \\n\\n\\nExcept for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.

Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part.\\nThe, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore.\\nSo February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know.\\nLet me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen.\\nLike, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just…\\nThis is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.”\\nI really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.”\\nThis is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good.\\nSo… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense.\\nSo… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening.\\nTwo years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.”\\nAs the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.”\\nSo I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love.\\nThree weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.”\\nThe point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.”\\nYou could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!”\\nSo we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.”\\nSo… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.”\\nSo we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.”\\nAt this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her.\\nI get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me.\\nThe next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.\\nThank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much!

Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people?\\nI had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit.\\nWe learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud.\\nYou don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if it’s you living another life.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nI mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em.\\nWe live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump.\\n[man 2] No. Boo!\\n“No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense.\\nNobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that.\\nThe White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is.\\nWell, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.”\\nHow’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles]\\nThe whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?”\\nObama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs]\\nYou know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole combo attractor. It’s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes.\\nI saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.”\\nEveryone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it.\\nI watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that.\\nOh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a good cult.\\nSome cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this isn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird.\\nBecause when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike.\\nAnd that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.”\\nThat’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs]\\nI have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses]\\nIt’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom! Go to bed!” [audience laughing]\\nJokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school.\\nMy daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly.\\nDebbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents.\\nSo out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful.\\nBut there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, “An open letter to Jennifer Lopez… Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “Let me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck!\\nThis is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure.\\nIs this what we wanted? I don’t know.\\n[woman] No!\\nNo.\\n[woman] No!\\nAre you sure?\\n[woman] No!\\nWhy are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom?\\nWhat’s happening?\\n[woman 2] No!\\nAre you White Panthers? What is this?\\n[man] Life sucks!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are you saying?\\n[man] Life can kind of suck sometimes.\\nLife can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!”\\nWhen you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit?\\nNo one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’ll do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.”\\nBut I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect!\\nWe’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out!\\nAn American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nThank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys. Thank you very much!\\n[cheering and applauding continues]\\n[rock music playing]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJoe Rogan, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

I left them parties early. I was out by nine, n*gga. “Somethin’ don’t look right, n*gga.” “It’s slippery in here, n*gga.”\\n[crowd gasps and laughs]\\nAtlanta saved my life.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nThe internet tried to kill me.\\nKatt Williams!\\n[audience jeers]\\nKatt Williams got in on it. Did y’all see the special? Katt Williams said he knew. [imitating Katt] “Jamie Foxx got so much money.” “They say he’s sufferin’ from a mystery illness.” “A mystery illness?” “What the ♪ Fuck?” ♪\\nThat shit sound just like that, n*gga.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nThat n*gga said… “Goddamn, that sound… [imitating Katt, dramatically] …a mystery illness.” “What the fuck?” [scoffs] That n*gga turned into the Wicked Witch of the West. [imitates Wicked Witch] “A mystery illness.” “I’ll get you my little Jamie and your little dog Toto too.” [cackles]\\n[crowd laughs]\\nKatt will say 2,000 things that don’t make sense, right? But then say four things that make sense and put “sir” after it. “The glass is half full, sir. I just filled it to the top, sir.” [crowd laughs] “Man goes to bed with an itchy ass, he wakes up with a smelly finger, sir.” [audience chuckles] [Jamie] I know, man. Y’all know me, man. And I’m so glad to see y’all here. I’m so glad to be here. [audience cheers] This is what I needed, man. You got a lot of people that prayed to make sure I was here.\\n[audience] Yes.\\nYes. And I appreciate every prayer, man. Now, what’s interesting is Katt Williams might be onto something. Because it is a mystery. [clicks tongue] We still don’t know exactly what happened to me. [sighs] All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer. Because I needed… every prayer. I appreciate every well-wish, Atlanta. Uh… to the world, I… I can’t thank you enough, even when I see people on the street, and they roll their window down and yell out, “Man, we glad you here.” As I look out, and I see my family and I… see my friends. [clicks tongue] I can’t tell you how good it feels. If you could see it through here… it feels amazing.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nIt actually happened here in Atlanta. A little history, Atlanta, I started doing stand-up comedy back in 1991, right here in Atlanta. So it’s fitting that I came back here to tell you, uh, the story because… what had happened was… [clicks tongue] [sighs, exhales deeply]\\n[sniffles]\\n[woman 1] We love you.\\n[woman 2] Atlanta saved your life.\\nHey, hello. You did. [crying] Wow. Man, please, Lord. Let me get through this. [crowd cheers]\\nPlease.\\n[woman 3] All right, you got it! You got it! [cheering continues] April 11th, I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for a aspirin, and I realized quickly that when you in a medical emergency, your boys don’t know what the fuck to do. And I was like, “Damn.” But I was having such a bad headache. So, I asked my boy, I said, “Listen, I need a… a… a aspirin.” Before I could get the aspirin… [ominous tones play] [clicks tongue] …I went out. [sniffles] [music fades] I don’t, um… I don’t remember 20 days.\\n[woman 1] Oh, man.\\n[audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What they told me was, was that… [clicks tongue]…they took me to the first doctor. And that doctor just gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home. [crowd murmurs] Yeah, I don’t know… What the fuck is that? [crowd chuckles] I don’t know if you can do Yelps… [audience chuckles] …for doctors, man. That’s half a star, n*gga. [audience laughs] You know? “No, he good. Give him that.” Man, what the fuck? But my sister… said, “No.” [woman] All right. Four foot 11… of nothin’ but pure love said that something’s wrong with my brother. She came over to see me, and I was… They told me I was leth… lethargic. And she says, “Get him in the car. That ain’t my brother right there.” My little sister who’s always played the background, now gotta play the lead. [man] Amen. [inhales sharply] They say she drove around Atlanta, sorta aimlessly. She didn’t really know where the hospitals was. But as she was drivin’ around, she came up on Piedmont Hospital. Give it up for Piedmont. [crowd cheering] What’s interesting about it is that as she drove around, she didn’t know anything about Piedmont Hospital, but she had a hunch that some angels is in there.\\n[woman 1] Mm-hmm.\\n[crowd murmurs in agreement] ‘Cause she said, “That’s what we gon’ need.”\\n[scattered applause]\\n[man 1] All right. [woman 2 whoops]\\n[man 2] Yes!\\n[woman 3] Hallelujah!\\n[woman 4] Love you.\\nLove you.\\n[woman 5] Atlanta saved your life!\\nAtlanta saved my life. [crowd cheering] So they tell me my sister took me into the hospital. And this cool white boy, Dr. Schuette… Cool white boy. They say he had on a Laker jersey. Just cool as shit, you know? But… he told my sister some horrible news about… her big brother. He said… “He’s havin’ a brain bleed…\\n[audience murmurs]\\n[Jamie sighs] …that’s led to a stroke.” [clicks tongue] Damn. [emotionally] Me. Me, man. Me. [softly] Wow. Here’s the thing. When you dream about what you want to be in life, you don’t dream tragedy.\\n[crowd] No.\\nYou dream everything is good. “I… I got the life. I got the cars.” “I got all that.” [sniffles] You don’t dream that something would go wrong. But when something does go wrong… you need a sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nFour foot 11.\\n[crowd] Mm-hmm.\\nFull of nothin’ but love.\\n[audience cheers and applauds] [sighs, sniffles] The cool doctor with the Laker jersey, white dude, said, “Listen.” “He’s havin’ this brain bleed that led to a stroke, and if I don’t go in his head right now, we’re gonna lose him.” [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What I was told was my sister fired right back and said, “You can go in his head, but you ain’t gonna find nothin’.” [audience laughs] He said, “Why you say that?” She said, “Have you seen how big this n*gga’s head is?” [audience laughs] My sister made a joke because sometimes you gotta laugh…\\n[crowd] To keep from crying.\\n…to keep from cryin’.\\n[crowd murmurs in agreement, applauds]\\n[cheering]\\nWhat actually happened was the doctor said, “If I don’t go in his head, we’re gonna lose him, and she fired back and said, “You can go in his head, but you’re not gonna find anything ’cause I already talked to God.”\\n[woman 1] That’s right.\\n[crowd cheers] The cool white doctor, named Dr. Schuette, shot right back and said, “I’m a religious man too.”\\n[woman 2 whoops]\\n[woman 3] All right. But I gotta do my job. [woman 3] All right. So, what I was told is that they take me in to operate on me, and, uh, my sister knelt down outside the operating room and prayed the whole time. [woman 3] All right. [quietly] Your life doesn’t flash before your face. It was kinda… oddly peaceful. I say this all the time. I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. I didn’t see the light. [audience chuckles] I was in a tunnel, though. It was hot in that tunnel.\\n[woman 1] Ooh!\\n[audience murmurs and chuckles] [laughing] [audience murmurs] Shit, am I goin’ to the wrong place in this motherfucka? ‘Cause I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the devil.\\nLike, “Come on, n*gga.”\\n[audience chuckles] Or was that Puffy?\\n[audience gasps and laughs]\\n[Jamie] I’m fuckin’ around. But if it was Puffy, he had a flamin’ bottle of Johnson &… No, I’m just kiddin’. [imitating Puffy] “Come on in!” No, I’m just kidding. [laughter dies down] No, I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. [clicks tongue] But my sister… [sniffles] …prayed the whole time. And when that cool white dude… [sniffles] …Dr. Schuette came out, he said, “Well, um, you was right.” “Your prayers are answered. We didn’t find where it was comin’ from.” “But he is havin’ a stroke.” “He may be able to make a full recovery.” “But it’s gonna be the worst year of his life.” [sniffles] That’s what it was, Atlanta. You finally got the story.\\n[man] Amen.\\n[clicks tongue]\\n[woman] Saved your life!\\nSaved my life. [crowd cheers] That’s why this moment is the most incredible moment. ‘Cause you do take it for granted. [sniffles] But I’mma tell you something about my sister, Deidra Dixon, and my daughter Corinne Marie Foxx. [dramatically] They held me the fuck down! [audience cheers] “Nobody sees him!” They cut it all off. [crowd cheers] They held it down. They didn’t want you to see me like that. I didn’t want you to see me like that.\\nI want you to see me like this.\\n[crowd] Yeah! [audience cheers] There’s another reason too why my daughter didn’t want nobody to see me ’cause I was dizzy from the… the stroke. I was so dizzy. So, my head would do this.\\n[crowd laughs]\\nStop… Stop laughing. Laugh. Go ahead, n*gga. I understand. But she says, “They gon’ meme the fuck outta this motherfucker.” [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I was doing that. [laughs] But now I have a better appreciation when I see people out and they doing this. I be like, “Oh, I know what that is. What’s up?” [crowd laughs] “What’s up with you?” “What’s up? Just chillin’.” “Just hangin’ out. What’s new?” I know. It’s fucked up, right? [audience chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles die down]\\n[woman] You look good!\\n[Jamie] Thank you so much. I feel good.\\n[audience cheers]\\nTwenty days I don’t remember. [sniffles]\\nBut on May 4th…\\n[crowd] Yeah? I woke up. [snaps] [crowd cheers] And when I woke up, I found myself in a wheelchair.\\nI couldn’t walk.\\n[audience groans] Couldn’t walk, bro. In a wheelchair, and I was like, “What the fuck is…?” “Why am I in a wheelchair?” I’m just coming out of some shit. I looked at Dave Brown. I said, “What am I doin’ in a wheelchair?” He said, “Foxx, you don’t remember?” “No! Why?” “What y’all doin’?” He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” [clicks tongue] “Dave, knock it off. Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.”\\n[audience chuckles]\\nHe said, “You don’t remember?” “I don’t remember, but I know Jamie Foxx ain’t got no stroke.” “‘Cause I’m Jamie Foxx. Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” “And don’t try to get out of that chair, ’cause you can’t walk.” I said, “N*gga…” [hesitates] “Shit!” [audience laughs] “What the fuck you do to my legs, Dave?” I said, “Dave…” [splutters] “What’s going on, man?” He said, “Foxx, it’s real.” “Come on, Dave, man. That’s a horrible joke.” [man 1] You right! I said, “Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [sighs] [crying] “It’s a bad joke, Dave.” [sniffles] “I don’t get strokes. Come on, man.” [audience murmurs sympathetically]\\n[man 2] We love you, man.\\nI love you back. [audience cheers] [quietly] “I don’t get strokes. I don’t get strokes.” “That’s old man shit, man. I don’t get no strokes, n*gga.” Stop this fucking… prank. [sniffles] [clicks tongue, sniffles] They flew me to Chicago for my rehab. Chi-town. [audience cheers] Right there. They took care of me. Shirley Ryan, right over there. [audience cheering] Took care of me. [clicks tongue] But when I got to the rehab, there was this lady that was all over me. She was all over me, brushin’ my teeth, and… and… and… and washing my face, fixin’ my clothes, pushin’ my wheelchair.\\nAnd I’m like, “Damn…” [mumbles]\\n[audience laughs] “Who is this bitch all over me, man?” “She all over me, n*gga. She all over me, n*gga.” I said, “Dave, is she a fan? Did she see Django? Like, what? Shit.” “Why she all over me like this, dawg?” And Dave says something that stopped me in my tracks. He says, “Foxx, that’s your nurse.” I said, “What kind of old man shit is that?” So, the first night, she says, “Okay. Time for the showers.” I say, “Okay. Somebody put me in the chair, get me to the water, I’ll knock it out.” She says, “No, I’m gonna bathe you.” I said, “No, the fuck you ain’t.” She says, “Well… “I say, “No, no, no.” “You not finna… No. You not finna see this pickle.” [audience laughs] She said, “What you mean?” I say, “Uh-uh. It’s…” “Why?” I said, “No. ‘Cause there’s shit goes along with this pickle.”\\n“I’m Black.”\\n[audience laughs] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “It’s a whole lot of shit goin’ on here with this pickle.” “I just can’t let you see this pickle just on… out the package that quick.” [audience laughs] I said, “There’s something wrong with it. I don’t know if it’s been cold.” Fellas, you know how it is. You don’t ever take your pants off right away in front of your girl. You gotta… pump some oil in that motherfucker. Your girl… Ever pull your drawers up? “Bitch. Hold on!” [crowd laughs] “What’s wrong?” “Ain’t nothin’ in this motherfucker yet.” And that shit be stuck to your thighs. She’s like, “Are you okay?” “No! You got to give me a three count.” [audience laughs] “Give me a three count before you expose my pickle like that.” I gotta… You know… That bitch… Even if we ain’t finna fuck, it gotta have a certain… [inhales sharply] So, I’m sayin’ this to the lady. I said, “You can’t see my pickle,” and she hit me with some crazy shit. She said, “J, you don’t remember, do you?” “What?” “I’ve been bathing you for the past month and a half.”\\n[audience exclaims, laughs]\\n[imitating Katt Williams] I said, “Mystery illness?” [audience laughs] “What the fuck?” She been bathing me for a month and a half. I said, “You been in there?” She says, “All in there.” Goddamn! – “All in there?”\\n[emphatically] “Yes, all in there.” [inhales sharply] Fuck! That affected me more than the stroke.\\nI’m like, “Damn, is my dick dead?”\\n[crowd laughs] “Because I need my dick!” [audience laughs] But, yeah. She said she’d been all in there, and then I asked a silly question. I said, “Well, was I representin’?” [audience laughs] She says, “I don’t know what that means.” She don’t, but we know what that means, right, brother? I’m like, “Fuck!” [inhales sharply] “Shit!” “She’s seen it!” “And I don’t remember her seein’ it!” So it hit me. I ain’t seen my dick in 20 days. So I rush to the bathroom, pull my pants down, look down. That motherfucker had a stroke too. [audience laughs] I said, “Man, what’s wrong, n*gga?” “You tell me, n*gga, what’s wrong?” “What happened?” “I don’t know. The lights went off.” [audience laughs] “You cool?” “No, I ain’t cool!” “Did you see the nurse?” “I seen the bitch. I didn’t do nothin’.” [audience laughs] Uh… [chuckling] [clicks tongue] Then it was the process of the therapist. They’d bring therapists for my therapy, and I didn’t want to hear that shit. I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need no fuckin’ therapists. Why did this shit even happen to me? I’m Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx. So, every therapist that came in, I said, “Get the fuck out.” “I don’t want to do this shit.” I… I… I felt like, uh, Wesley Snipes in New Jack City. When he was at the table at the end and Gee Money would walk up. [as Gee] “Yo, you, Nino.” [as Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] “Huh.” “Is that what this is about? Over a fucking skeezer?” “I don’t give a shit about that ho bitch.” [crowd laughs] [scoffs] “Yeah, yeah.” “Don’t nobody know nothing, huh? Hmm, well, I’ll be goddamned.” “Huh. Hmm. Ha. Huh.” [audience laughs] [as Gee] “If you’d have been…” [as Nino] “What?” “If I’d have been what?!” “That’s what I thought you said. ‘Cause that’s all I got.” “Nothin’!”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n“Now, leave me.” [imitating Gee] “Yo, Nino.” [imitating Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] That’s my movie. [chuckles] Remember the old dude? [imitating Bill Cobbs] “Your soul is required in hell, young man.” “Look at you in here, sellin’ drugs to your own people.” [chuckles, imitating Nino] “Cancel this bitch. I’ll buy me another one.” “Sit your five-dollar ass down…” [crowd] “Before I make change!” [Jamie] That’s my audience. That’s Atlanta! Huh. Yeah. [crowd cheers] I was Wesley Snipes. I was arrogant. “I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need nothin’. I don’t want to see no therapist.” They say, “You got a second chance.” “I don’t want a second chance.” “What’s wrong with my first chance?” What’s wrong with my first chance? So, I was… irreverent. I was… I gave up. [sniffles] Then… I heard in the other part of the room… I heard ’em go, “We need Holly.” [audience chuckles] Who the fuck is that? “We need Holly for this one. Only Holly can get him goin’.” “Holly is the one.” I’m like, “I don’t give a fuck about no Holly.” “She gon’ get the same shit.” “And she comin’ here on that bullshit.” You know them movies, “It’s only one person could do this.” “We gotta get Holly.” I’m like, “Man, bull-Holly.’\\n[sniffles]\\n[audience laughs] I’m layin’ in my bed. That’s all I could do every day. I could walk a little bit, but I couldn’t walk. So it’s early in the morning. I hear, “Get up!” Goddamn! “I’m Holly, motherfucker!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[woman] Oh, damn. I said, “Hey, Holly.” [imitating Holly] “Yes, listen. You gotta knock this shit off.” “This whole Jamie Foxx shit.” “Stop this arrogant bullshit.” “That stroke doesn’t give a fuck about who you are.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker.”\\n[audience cheers]\\n[woman] Go, Holly! “All of this ‘I’m Jamie Foxx’ and this Wesley Snipes shit you’re doin’.” “New Jack City.” “Fuck that city.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, and I can get you there, but you gotta tell me the truth and cut this ‘Jamie Foxx’ shit.” I say, “Yeah, miss lady, I’m good.” “Oh, you good?” “You can beat this?” I say, “Yeah.” “Walk to me now.” I said, “Yeah…” [audience chuckles] [woman 1] Aww. [woman 2] Oh. [man] Damn, bro. She said, “I can help you, Jamie Foxx.” [sniffles] “But you gotta tell me what’s really goin’ on with you.” “You’re dizzy, right?” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” “You’re so dizzy, you can’t walk.” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” She says, “You remember the movie Karate Kid?” I say, “Yes.” She said, “We gonna wax on… [with audience]…wax off.”\\n[audience cheers]\\nI said, “What that mean?” She says, “I’m gonna help you with that so you can go back to bein’ a man.” She said, “Take your right hand, and put it on your left shoulder.” “Your left hand on your right shoulder. Now close your eyes.” And I fell. She picked me back up. “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “I want you to look left, and I want you to look right.” I look left. I look right. I fell. She said, “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “This is it. Look left and look right.” I look left. I look right. I got that. And then she said, “Now, Jamie Foxx, now you got that? I want you to look up and look down.” I look up, look down, I got dizzy. I fell back in my bed, and I said, “Miss Holly, I don’t want to do this no more, man.” “What has happened to me?” [shakily] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “I don’t want to do this.” And she said, “I got 15 more minutes left.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, motherfucka.”\\n[applause]\\n[woman] Holly! “You look left, and you look right.” I looked left, right. She said, “Go to sleep!” [snores] [crowd laughs] The next mornin’… “Get up!” Goddamn, bitch. You gotta get a bell around your neck or somethin’. [audience laughs] She said, “Look left, look right.” Huh? “Look up! Look down!” I said, “Yeah.” “You gotta kill that old Jamie Foxx in order for the new Jamie Foxx to walk outta here.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience cheers] Next morning came, Holly came in. I was already out of bed. “Hey, bitch.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I knew you was coming, bitch. I’m up!” “Knock it the fuck off.” “Left, right, up, down. Get the fuck outta here.” So I got down again, and Holly took me into the big facility, but there’s other patients in there, and I was down in the dumps. She says, “What’s your fuckin’ problem?” “What is your problem? You don’t want to fight?” She said, “Jamie, when you walk in this facility, look to the left of you, people that ain’t gonna get outta here.”\\n[audience groans]\\nAnd I did. I looked… There was a quadriplegic. There was a person in a wheelchair. There was another guy’s whole side was gone. She said, “They not gettin’ outta here.” There was one little white lady. All she could do was… turn this little pinwheel. She said, “What do you think now?” And I wept. Cryin’. I said, “God, to all the blessings, go over there.” [man] Yes. [Jamie crying softly] So, then they called my… my psychiatrist, Dragana. He knew I was going through some shit. He says, “What’s goin’ on with you? Why can’t we just talk it out?” I said, “Dragana, we can’t, man, ’cause I’m angry.” “I don’t know why this is happenin’ to me.” And as I said that, I knew why this was happenin’ to me.\\nIt was God.\\n[woman] There it is. [gently] It was God. It was God. I talked to him different. I was like, “Hey, man. You sure you got the right dude?” He says, “Who’s this?” I say, “It’s Foxx!” “Who?” “Foxx!” “Come on, G, it’s J!” “Foxx! Jamie Foxx.” “The one down here puttin’ smiles on people’s faces.” “Who?” I said, “Damn. You want my government name? Eric Bishop.” [audience laughs] “Terrell, Texas? The one that beat the odds, that got the Oscars?” “The one that got the Grammys? C’mon, G. It’s J.” “Come on, man!” He said, “What’s up, my n*gga?” [audience laughs] You can tell by that phrase alone that God is not white.\\n[crowd laughs]\\n‘Cause I wouldn’t even let the Messiah call me that. That’s how me and God talk. I said, “Damn, man, you sure? Why am I going through this?” “Is it a clerical error?” “Did Peter write down the wrong name? I mean, did you read it wrong?” “I’m not sayin’… I’m just sayin’, you been at this for a while.” “Maybe you just… read that shit wrong, my n*gga.” [crowd chuckles] He said, “No. This should be happenin’ to you.” I said, “What? Why?” I said, “God, look at all these bad people.” [crowd murmurs] “Look at all these bad people down here.” “Shouldn’t these bad people be goin’ through this?” You know what he said? “Those bad people already belong to somebody else.” [audience exclaims and murmurs] “You belong to me.”\\n[crowd cheers and applauds]\\n“Remember when you used to say your grace before you ate your food?” “You belong to me.” “Remember when you played the piano for the church?” “When’s the last time you been to church, my n*gga?” [audience exclaims]\\n[man] Mm.\\n[woman] Mm! But I shot back, “God, I get it.” “But the crime don’t fit the punishment.” [crowd laughs] “The crime don’t fit… I’m serious!” “This is too much on me. I’m still down here. I’m gregarious.” “I’m makin’ people laugh, making ’em have fun.” I said, “But look, what this is doin’ to my family, God.” I said, “Look what it’s doing to my kids.” And you know what he said? “You see what they did to my kid?” [audience exclaims]\\n[applause]\\n[woman] Heavy. I gave you two beautiful daughters. [man] Amen. That was my only… begotten son. [scattered applause] And then I said, “Man, why you bringing up old shit?” [audience laughs] As soon as I said it, I got dizzy. I said, “Okay, okay!” “G, come on, man! Come on. Knock it off, bro.” “C’mon, my n*gga. I’m just…” “Bro, I’m a kidder!” [chuckles] “Bro, I’m joking. Come one, man.” “Let me out this bitch. Come on, bro.” “I’m fuckin’ around, bro.” “Okay. I didn’t mean to say ‘fuckin’.” I’m foolin’.” “Just let up off me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd finally, it came to me. It’s about blessings.\\n[woman 1] Yes.\\n[woman 2] Right.\\nGod blessed me with this talent.\\n[man] Amen. He blessed me with all this money and this fame. And when I forgot about God… [woman 3] Mm! …he blessed me with a stroke.\\n[sound distorts]\\n[gentle piano music playing]\\n[crowd applauding]\\n[Jamie crying] Just give me one second.\\n[gospel singer] ♪ Change me, O God ♪ ♪ Make me more like you… ♪\\n[Jamie] Y’all know I couldn’t wipe my own ass?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[sweet tune fades slowly] [hushed] I couldn’t wipe my own ass. That’s what really got me at one point. I went from Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx to, “Okay, lean over.”\\n[crowd laughs]\\n“Okay, we’re gonna go in there.” I said, “Damn, y’all gotta go all the way?” Damn, this is… Oh, this is fucked. Ugh. I can’t wipe my own booty… Ass. [inhales sharply] I lost everything. But the only thing I could hold onto was… was my sense of humor. I never let that go. I couldn’t necessarily walk that good. I couldn’t talk that good. But I… But I didn’t let go of my funny. I said, “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” So I was always crackin’ jokes to the point to where the nurses thought I was really losin’ my mind. And I was never myself. Never myself. ‘Cause it’s a wellness check, they ask you who you are. For five days, I was Denzel Washington. I was Denzel. [as Denzel] “All right.” [chuckles] “All right, so that’s what you’re tellin’ me. Okay.” “All right.” [chuckles] “You gotta wipe my ass, huh? Okay.” “All right. Okay.” “That’s what you’re telling me. I had a stroke. Okay.” “All right. You gotta wipe my…” [chuckling] Ah. My nurses. My nurses. [chuckles] “So, you’re tellin’ me… That’s what you’re tellin’ me.” “You gotta wipe my…” “Okay, I’m gonna lean over. Okay. I’m gonna lean over.” [laughs] “I’m gonna lean over. Get on in. Okay. You goin’ too far.” “You get your fuckin’ hands off me!” [crowd applauds] “You think you can do this shit to me?!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You’ll be serving tapioca pudding in Pelican Bay when I’m done with you!” [audience chuckles] “You had a stroke, sir.” [with audience] “That stroke ain’t got shit on me!” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For three days, I was Dave Chappelle. [imitating Chappelle] “Damn, it’s crazy!” “I can’t believe I came in, they said, ‘Dave, you gone and had a stroke.\\'” “There’s no way Dave could have a stroke. I was incensed!” “Damn, there’s no way. I’m strong! Said they gotta wipe my ass.” “No way! I’m strong!” “Wu-Tang, n*gga! Pow!” [crowd laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For six days, I was Mike Tyson. [imitating Tyson] “I’m heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “Hello, I’m Mike Tyson. Heavyweight boxing champ of the world.” “Somebody told me I had a sthoke.”\\n[crowd laughs]\\n[as nurse] “Sir, it’s ‘stroke.\\'” [as Tyson] “No, ‘sthoke.’ I had a sthoke.” [as nurse] “You’re not saying it right.” [as Tyson] “I can say it however I want.” “Because I’m Mike Tyson, heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “So, I say, ‘sthoke.\\'” “You’re not gonna wipe my ass. Nobody’s goin’ near my culo.” [audience chuckles] “They said I had a sthoke.” “And I gotta fight, and I don’t care who I fight.”\\n“I’ll fight Logan Paul.”\\n[crowd laughing] “I’ll fight Jake Paul.” “I’ll fight RuPaul. I don’t care who it is I fight.” “Because I don’t get sthokes.” “I give sthokes.” “I be sthokin.\\'” “That’s what I be doin’.” [laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for like five days, I was Jay-Z.\\n[crowd exclaims]\\n[chuckles slightly, imitating Jay-Z] “Last night was crazy.” “It’s crazy. They told me I had an ailment.” “I said, ‘Impossible.\\'” [audience laughs] “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles slightly] “I started… started off in Marcy Projects, you know.” “Dame had an idea.” “Y’know, he said, ‘Well, you do music.\\'” “I said, ‘Great.\\'” “Then later, he came with the clothing line.” [restrained chuckle] “And then I met B.” [awkward, drawn-out laugh] “So, they told me I had an illness. I said, ‘Impossible.\\'” “They said, ‘Are you mad?’ I said, ‘No.\\'” “And then they said I need a bedpan.” “And I said, ‘I don’t do bedpans.\\'” “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles timidly] “And then I shit all over myself.” [audience laughs] [Jamie] “I said, ‘Oh, shit.” “I think I need a bedpan.” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for three days, I was this dude.\\n\\n\\n\\n[imitating Trump] “There’s lots of great nurses.” “Lots of great nurses. I see the Blacks.” “I like the Blacks.” “They’re hungry. They’re eating dogs.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“They’re eating pets! They’re eating dogs!” “They’re eating pets. I like the Blacks.” “The Haitians. Sak pase.” “Map boule. They’re eating dogs.” “I like all of the nurses. I like…” “I like the nurses. I like the nurses.” “I like ’em. They like me. I like them. I like the white nurses.” [emphatic] “I like the white nurses.” “I like the Black nurses.” “I like all of the nurses. The Black…” “I like… I have a huge, huge Black following.” “I got a huge… There’s a Black. There’s another Black.” “There’s another Black. Oh, Puerto Rican. Same shit.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I like Kamaya-maya.” “Kamaya-maya Harris.” “I love Kamaya-maya.” “What’s her name? Kamala! Kamala!” “I love Kamala. I love… I love… I love Kamala.” “I love Kamala. I love Kamala.” “She’s Black. She just turned Black. I don’t know where she was.” “She just became Black. She just… ‘Poof, I’m Black!\\'” “This is fine. If she wants to turn Black, she can turn Black.” “I like her because she’s Black and she’s Indian.” “I like that. I like it.” “She’s mixed. She’s Black. Hey, for real, though. And Indian.”\\n[imitating Native American chant]\\n[audience exclaims] [panting] If I can stay funny… [all]…I can stay alive. [crowd cheering] [Jamie clicks tongue] ‘Cause it was touch and go. [clicks tongue] It was touch and go. [clicks tongue] And they told me, uh… They said the first 15 days, they thought they were gonna lose me because my vitals were out of control. [imitates monitor beeping] They said, “We’re gonna lose him.” So it was a 13-or 14-day period where he says, “We gotta keep him calm.” “And we’ve given him every medication. It’s not workin’.” “We have to keep him calm.” “His vitals are so high, we’re gonna lose him.” You know what the worst thing to have when you tryin’ to stay calm in a hospital room? Black family members. [audience laughs] Aka, n*ggas. ‘Cause you know they come in with, “Oh, Lord!” “Good God Almighty!”\\n“Not my baby! Not now! Not now!”\\n[alert beeps] “Ooh, good God Almighty! Please save him, Jesus!” My Black family was goin’ so crazy, my white doctor said, “Hey, we need to keep these n*ggas outta here so he can stay alive.” I’m jokin’. He didn’t say that. Now, you know if I was to say that, that’s what TMZ would report.\\n[imitates news fanfare]\\n[imitating TMZ announcer] “Jamie Foxx said his white doctor had to call him ‘n*gga’ in order to stay alive.” That’s not what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. All right? He actually said, “Get these Black motherfuckers outta here.” No, I’m kidding. But it was real. My vitals were so bad, they were gonna lose me. And… that’s when a miracle happened, and that miracle was working through my youngest daughter. She’s 14. I didn’t want her to see me like that. But she snuck into my hospital room with her guitar. [crowd] Aww. And she says, “I know what my daddy needs.” [breathing shakily] She said, “That’s my daddy.” What’s interesting is my daughter used to carry her guitar all the time with her. And they said, when she was playing, my vitals… went down. The nurses at the nurses’ station were baffled. Like, “Wow, what did they give him?” So they rushed into the room, and she said, “Shh.” [softly] I got him. My daughter used to carry that guitar when she was ten years old. She would carry it everywhere. She carried it everywhere. I was like, “You gonna carry a guitar?” Going to Disneyland, she got that guitar. [crowd laughs] We going to a football game, she got that guitar. Everywhere we went, she had the guitar. But you know what I found out? It was God in that guitar.\\n[women] Yes.\\n[crowd applauds] God was in that guitar. That’s my spiritual defibrillator. [crowd] Aww. [crowd cheering] [woman] Aww! That’s Anelise. When you think about, as you grow older, you wonder about those hard times. Who’s gon’ be there? Who’s actually gonna be there? [crowd] Aww. I don’t have to wonder that anymore.

I want to get through this ’cause every time I run into somebody now, that I haven’t seen in a while, I cry. ‘Cause y’all my people. You’ve known me for so long, so every time I run… Especially when I run into my homies. I ran into T.I., I cried. I think he kinda cried… But he was like… [as T.I.] “What you sayin’, my n*gga?” “What you sayin’ with me, partner?” “I pray for you, partner. Period.” “I pray for your partner. I pray for you. I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, partner.” “I prayed expeditiously for you, n*gga.” [audience laughing] But every time I run into somebody, I cry. I ran into T.I., I cried. I ran into Candice Parker, I cried. Then, somehow, I ran into Halle Berry. [audience exclaims] I didn’t cry as much.\\n[crowd laughs]\\n‘Cause Halle just rushed me and hugged me so tight. I was like, “Ooh, Lord, have mercy, Jesus.” “This here is Halle Berry.” And she don’t realize how fucking sexy she is. And I don’t want to blow the moment ’cause it was heartfelt. She said, “Jamie, oh my God!” And she hugged me. I said, “Ooh, oh, my gosh.” She said, “There’s so much I wanted to tell you.” And I said, “There’s so much I gotta tell you!” ‘Cause she was huggin’ me. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Please don’t let me disrespect this moment.” So I had to relay… ‘Cause the hug was so nice, I had to relay to my pickle. “Hey, stand down, n*gga. This ain’t that kind of hug.” He shot back, “Shit!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“N*gga, that’s Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” “Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” I’m like, “Man, don’t blow this for me, my n*gga. She’ll feel it!” “Please!” And she’s holding me. She’s talkin’ to me, this close to my ear. I said, “Goddamn!” She right here in my ear. I said, “Damn!” Know how women pretty like that always have a fragrance you’ve never smelled. That shit… I said… [sniffs] “Ooh, what the fuck is that?” “God, this smells like Heaven.” I said… [inhales] I took that shit in, and she was hugging me. I said, “Oh, God, please. Please stay with me, Lord. Please.” “Don’t let me fuck this moment up.” She hugged, and then she… As I tried to pull away, she hugged tighter. Oof. I said, “Good God Almighty.” [crowd laughs] And I could feel my hips. I said, “Hips! Hips, stop! Stop!” But I did just clench up to let her know I’m there.\\n[crowd laughs]\\nSo she’s huggin’ me, and I’m trying to get out of this moment, and as I’m trying to push away from her heartfelt sexual grip, I tried to push away, know what she did? She kissed me on my neck. [crowd exclaims] And n*gga, I came… [crowd exclaims] …to my senses! [crowd laughing] You nasty motherfuckers. Yo, man, I ain’t finna come like that with Halle. And as she was huggin’ me, “Oh my God, thank you so much.” So Halle, when you see this, please understand what I’m sayin’. You just so beautiful. That’s all we wanna say. Halle you’re beautiful. So she let me go. She let me out of her clutches. I said, “Thank you, Jesus!” But then, I felt a rumblin’. I felt something rumbling. I said, “Ooh, whee!” “I can’t wait.” So I rushed to the bathroom to see what was rumblin’. And I pulled my pants down, and I said, “Oh, shit!” “Somebody back!” [laughs] “Somebody back!” And then I ask him, “Hey, n*gga, what got into you?” Know what he said? “Sometimes, you gotta pop out and show n*ggas.”\\n[intense beat playing]\\n♪ We back!

What’s happening? What’s going on, Bay Area? Listen to me, tonight, tonight’s gonna be special, San Jose.\\n[music ends]\\nYou know what I love when I look out here? I love the diversity I see here. [audience laughs and cheers] Not racially. Financially. [audience laughs] [Hasan chuckles jokingly] The good stuff. The stuff that matters. The stuff that’s real. The money, all right? There’s money in this room. But there’s also not money in this room. [audience laughs] That’s the Bay. You’re not as progressive as you think you are, Bay Area. In this room right now, there’s a guy who owns three homes. And he’s sitting directly next to a dude who only owns three hoodies. [audience laughs] And one of y’all’s getting stabbed tonight. It’s probably the landlord.\\n[laughs]\\n[audience laughs]\\nBecause it’s all here. I can see it. It’s all here. Whoo-hoo. We got it all here. We got the one percent, right? We got, like, Palo Alto, Los Altos. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Stanford area, right? Yeah, the one percent. Yeah! Yes. You definitely drive a Tesla. I can see it. [audience laughs] Yeah, the one percent right here, eh? Then way the fuck back there, we have the 99% just… [audience cheering] Hayward, Richmond, East Oakland. Yeah! Yeah, this is your landlord! Kill him! Kill him! Why does he keep raising the rent? [laughs] This is why I had to do it in the Bay. Even when you’re rich in the Bay, you’re poor. [audience laughs] You could be a Google engineer making 900 grand a year, and you have to live in a trap house in East Oakland, and you’re on OnlyFans making them cheeks clap just so you can pay rent. Just so you can pay this uncle rent. Dude, we have Zillow.com, and we’re still a functioning society. How? Do you know what Zillow.com is? Zillow.com is a website where you can type in the address of someone you’re jealous of… [audience laughs] and you can see their mortgage payment. [audience laughs] Dude, we’re never gonna own. Millennials, Gen Z, y’all are never, never gonna own homes.\\nAnd it’s our fault.\\n[woman] Yup. We fumbled the bag. Because for years we were praying to God. “God, please fix the housing crisis.” “Please open up the supply of available homes in this country.” And then, in March of 2020, God was like, “Here.” [audience laughs] “Here’s a disease that specifically kills old people.” [audience laughs] And we were like, “No!” “Wear a mask!” “Save Grandma!” “Stop the spread!” Let it spread. [audience laughs] Let God cook. [audience laughing and cheering] Yeah, we’re idiots, Californians. We’re fucking idiots. Look at all the states that were anti-mask. Plenty of homes. [audience laughs] Nevada, Georgia, Florida. Plenty of homes. Plenty of dead grandmas. These people accept God’s blessings. [audience laughs] All I’m saying is if you were pro-mask, you cannot complain about housing prices. What do you want? You wanna save Grandma or you want a backyard? You can’t have both. [audience laughs] Dude, the same problem with the housing market, these fucking Boomers will not die, is the same problem with the US government.\\nThese fucking Boomers will not die.\\n[audience cheers]\\nOur entire government is just a mass nursing home-dot-gov. I mean, it’s fucking… Uncle, why are you clapping? That’s you. You’re like, “Yeah!” What? Even he’s like, “They’re too old, man!” [audience laughs] This is gonna come out right before the election. People are arguing about the president. Fucking zoom out. Look at Congress. There’s 535 members of Congress, and they’re all old as fuck. Dude, Nancy Pelosi is 84 years old. [audience murmuring] Is anyone here 84 years old? [audience laughs] Yeah, of course not! Yes, it’s 7:00 p.m. Of course not! It’s seven o’clock. You’re asleep. Of course you’re not here. Why would you be here? Why the fuck would you be here? People are like, “Oh, Hasan, you’re really ageist.” “That really age…” Yeah, I am capital-A ageist. [audience laughs] Write about it. Substack it. Make it the headline. “I am age…” Age matters. Ask Drake. [audience exclaims] It is a pertinent detail. Hey! Hey! Hey! I thought we were the science people. Progressives, “Trust the science.” “Believe the science. Don’t let your kids on social media.” “The synapses in their brain…” “The synapses in their brain are still develo…” “The synapses.” Senator Chuck Grassley is 90 years old. [audience laughs] What do you think the synapse…? What… [audience cheering] He has the MRI brain scan of an NFL quarterback. It’s fucking applesauce up there. Why don’t we treat our politicians the same way we treat our professional athletes? Here in America, the moment you lose just a little bit of edge as an athlete, we fucking turn on you. [audience laughs] Within two years. Even the GOATs, right? Michael Jordan with the Wizards. Kobe with the Achilles. Look at the way that we treated Tom Brady. The moment Tom Brady couldn’t give us an eighth Super Bowl, we were like, “Brady, you got two more years.” This motherfucker lost to the Rams, right? “One more year, Brady.” Then this motherfucker lost to the Cowboys. “Bring this old geezer to the back of the shed.” “Let’s put two bullets into his skull.” “Let’s tear apart his marriage. Let’s ridicule his children.” “Let’s roast his ass on Netflix in 190 countries and just piss all over his legacy.” Just, “Tudum!”\\n[audience whooping]\\n[laughs] Now look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [audience exclaims] Eighty-seven years old! Ruth Bader Ginsburg battled cancer, five times in the last 20 years of her life. And Barack Obama was like, “Please, Ruth, for the love of God, retire so I can replace you.” And this geriatric coffin-dodger was like, “Fuck you, Barry.” [audience laughs] “I’ll see you in fucking hell.” [audience laughs] And every progressive was like, “Yas, queen!” “Notorious RBG.” If we treated Ruth Bader Ginsburg the same way we treated Tom Brady, abortion would still be legal in all 50 states. [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s interesting? Depending on where I do that joke, the audience reacts very differently. Sometimes when I do that joke, Trump fans get mad at me. Sometimes Biden fans get mad at me. But here’s my thing. Why are you a fan? [audience laughs] You know? Like, you’re like a fan of a president. You have like a T-shirt. You have like a poster on the wall. Like, “This is my guy!” “He’s my…” Like, being a fan of a politician is like being a fan of a national bank. [audience laughs] Imagine walking through downtown San Jose and seeing some loser with a T-shirt. Just like, “Citibank!” You see another guy, “No, fuck you, bro! Wells Fargo!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Do you wanna be on the right side of history?” It’s like, dude, I’ve banked with both. They will disappoint you for different reasons. Because I’ve met these people. I’ve met all of them. I’m part of the Illuminati. [audience laughs] They all reach out to me during election season. They think I’m the brown whisperer. [audience laughs] They think if we have lunch, I’ll blow the conch. Know what I mean? I’ll be like… [imitates blowing conch shell] “Browns… we must vote for Andrew Yang!” [audience laughs and applauds] No, why are you clap… No, don’t clap! They’re all fucking insane. I am 38 years old. This will be the tenth presidential cycle of my lifetime. Every president in my lifetime goes into office a sociopath and then leaves a war criminal. [whoops] Because they all want one thing. You know what they want? They want the ring. Ooh, they want the ring of power. They want it. They want it more than marriage, more than family. More than their kids. Look at Hillary Clinton. Look at how bad Hillary Clinton wanted to be president. Hillary Clinton wanted to be president so bad, she was willing to sit in the same office… [audience exclaiming] Not a different office. Not a replica House of Cards office. The Oval Office. That is sociopathic ambition. That’s why there’s so many Indians in politics. [audience laughs] Bro, we got sociopathic ambition. In one generation, look how many Indians there are in politics, running the highest offices around the world. One generation. Rishi Sunak. Nikki Haley. Vivek Ramaswamy. Half of Kamala Harris when she wants our vote. We are fucking killing it!\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Hasan laughs] Dude… Look at the Republican Party. There are more Indians in the Republican Party than my bachelor party. [audience laughs] And right now it’s wild. Y’all, more minorities with melanin, ooh, joining the hard-R Republicans. It’s happening more than ever. And all my white NPR tote-bag friends, it fries their brain. They’re like, “What the fuck is going on?” “Why are all these Mexicans voting for Donald Trump?” [audience laughs] “He calls them rapists!” I’m like, “Chelsea… do you know what I would let a politician call me if I could pay zero percent federal income tax?” [audience laughs] “I would let you body-cavity search me at every airport.” “Spit in my mouth and call me a terrorist.” [imitates spitting] Daddy wants to pay zero-percent FICA. That’s the thing Caucasia will never understand about Beige-istan. We are way more practical than we are progressive. [audience laughing and cheering]\\nSir, what’s your name?\\nNicholas. Nicholas. Great, perfect.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] You’re clapping at “Beige…” Do you know what Beige-istan is?\\nSort of.\\nOkay. You’re like, “Sort of”? Gentlemen, let me bring you into this as well.\\nMy good sir, what’s your name?\\nVlad. Vlad. Perfect. And…?\\nIan.\\n…Ian. Okay. So there’s… There’s white America. There’s Black America. Then there’s Beige-istan. [audience laughs] And, I mean, that’s just everybody. Indians, Latinos, Filipinos, wherever the fuck Bruno Mars is from. Beige-istan. Right? Okay? Listen, Beige-istan, we got four issues. Politicians, they pander to us. We just got four issues. You do these four, we’ll vote for you. Send this to the governor. These are the four issues. Number one. Give me a green card. [audience laughing and cheering] [laughs] You see that? Everyone, “I’ll suck your dick! Give me that green card!” “Give me an H-1B!” Number two. Believe in God. Preferably one of the religions that makes you feel bad after you masturbate.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThose are the real ones. Number three. I told you, I don’t like paying taxes. [audience laughs] Number four. Don’t bomb my home country. [audience cheering and whooping] But if you give me number one… I’ll let you do number four. [Hasan laughs maniacally] The way you leaned into him, you know what I’m talking about! You know the Beige guilt. We feel so much Beige guilt. Oh! We talk about white guilt all the time. You know what you did. God knows what you did, right? Black people, you have no guilt. That’s why you guys can dance, right? You didn’t hurt anybody. Like, “Look at the rhythm.” He can’t dance. Like, “Slavery!” Fuck, right? It’s too much. It’s too much. But Beige guilt’s different. Beige guilt, we’re immigrants. We’re immigrants by choice. We know the world is like Star Wars. You have the Empire ran by Lord Vader, that’s America. [audience laughs] The Empire has all the money, the weapons, the military bases all over the galaxy. And for the past half-century, the Empire has been bombing the shit out of the Rebellion. That’s Beige-istan. Cambodia, Korea, Vietnam, Japan. [scats “The Imperial March\\nDarth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza. [scats “The Imperial March\\nDarth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Then in 1982, my dad got a green card to go live in the Empire. And for the past 40 years, we’ve been funding the destruction of Tatooine. And we did all that… for a white BMW 3 Series. [audience laughing and whooping] Which ironically looks like a Stormtrooper. [audience laughs] I’m joking, by the way. I don’t own a white BMW 3 Series. I lease… [audience laughs] …a 2023 Kia Carnival. I lease it. So if you wanna fact-check me, I just wanna let you know, I lease a 2023 Kia Carnival, $431 a month. We leased it from Columbia Kia. We got it at the Summer Kia Sales Event. You can get a brand-new Kia Sorento or Kia Carnival for zero down, zero APR financing. The Kia Summer Sales Event starts now. Kia, movement that inspires. I have to do this now, you guys. I have to be factually accurate. Because I don’t know if you saw this last year. The New Yorker fact-checked my stand-up comedy.\\n[audience whooping]\\n[laughs] Yeah. They were just like, “Ah! Ho-ho-ho! Breaking news. Magicians aren’t wizards.” And now, now I have a “controversies” tab on my Wikipedia. [audience laughing and applauding] No! Why are you… No! Don’t clap! What are you doing? Why are you clapping? What the fuck is wrong… It’s a dorky controversy. What is wrong with you guys? It’s not even a good one. I didn’t fuck a porn star. [audience laughs] I didn’t diddle a boy. [audience laughs] I got caught embellishing for dramatic effect. [audience laughs] Same crime your aunt is guilty of over Thanksgiving. [audience laughs] [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s wild? This is the greatest irony. The greatest irony of all of this is that if you want to call me out for being a liar, you don’t have to fact-check my stand-up comedy. I’m a heterosexual man. [audience laughs] I lie all the time. [audience laughs] I let that shit fly like Steph. Like, I’m just like, “Lie.” Oh! Lie. Like, let it fly. Over dumb shit. Stupid… I’ll be at CVS checking out. Just… [imitating scanner beeping] Like, “Oh, my God. Hey!” “Um, do you wanna donate to the American Diabetes Association?” I’ll be like, “Oh, yeah, maybe later.” I’m never donating. [audience laughs] And both my parents have diabetes.\\n[audience exclaiming and laughing]\\n[Hasan laughs] Yes! You can’t guilt… No, don’t you fucking judge me. I have already donated to the Minhaj Diabetes Association. I bought my dad a fucking Peloton. He never uses it. [audience laughs] He only uses it to hang his wet towels. He’s like, “Oh, look at that. Wow.” “Look at how fast it dries, Hasan. Wow! Why aren’t you donating?” I’m like, “Why aren’t you pedaling?” Let’s start with the problem and not the symptom. I’m never donating. And I’m definitely getting diabetes. That’s the crazy part. And I should care. I’m almost 40 years old. I can feel it. The midlife crisis has hit. There’s a lot of guys my age, around this age. I can feel it in the room. Every guy my age is trying to get rich or ripped as quickly as possible. [audience laughs] Just software engineers out here biohacking. Fucking cold-plunging. Fucking doing Brazilian jujitsu. Fucking doing this shit. [audience laughs] Fucking flipping tires. Idiots. Idiots. Fucking pharmacist hard pivoting into financial experts. Getting into crypto. Idiots. Every woman in my life, y’all could not be bothered by crypto fucking currency. You’re just like, “Nah.” “I know what this is.” “I had an aunt that sold Avon. This is some bullshit.” [audience cheering] “This is Herbalife for men.” Go back upstairs and keep playing fantasy football, you fucking idiot. [audience laughs] How old are you, my man?\\n17.\\n17? So you were looking into crypto for sure. [laughs] You know what it is? I’m part of a generation of men that don’t read, but listen to podcasts. [audience laughs] Terrifying. All my homeys out here texting me alpha-male memes, just… “Hard times make hard men.” “Hard men make good times.” “Good times make soft men.” “A society will never value its men until the wolves are at the door.” I’m like, “Sanjay, you’re a software engineer.” “Shut the fuck up.” Why… [audience cheering and whooping] Why are you texting me like you’re Julius Caesar? “Whatever, bro.” “Mamba mentality.” Mamba mentality! Sanjay, you blew your knee out playing pickleball and you’re quoting Kobe Bryant. If Kobe knew you were quoting him, he’d put you in a helicopter and crash that shit himself. [audience exclaiming] [man coughing] You okay, bro? Don’t die. You all right? [audience laughs] [laughs] It wasn’t… How old are you, bro?\\nI’m 19.\\nYou’re 19. Big chain poppin’! Ooh! [laughs] [Hasan laughs] There’s a lot of chains on right now. Just a lot of, “Ooh.” A lot of just Desi Drake energy here tonight. The way y’all are lined up is fucking Algebra 2 Trig, just like, ta-ta! Ninety-degree angle just fucking make it. Make it perpendicular. Ladies, you wanna know why all these guys secretly listen to Jordan Peterson?\\n[woman 1] Why?\\n[woman 2] Why? I’ll tell you why. I’ll tell you. We’re scared. We’re so afraid that the best is behind us. The best hairline. [audience laughs] The best body. The best dick. [audience laughs] Back there. You’re 17, right? [scoffs] I remember 17, man. How old are you?\\n[man] I’m 39.\\nYou’re 39? Remember when you were 17? Remember when your shit was just like, pow! Remember when it was just… [yells] Right? It was like the Bruce Lee one-inch punch. You’re just like… [yells] [audience laughs] You remember that shit, man? When I’d be at a urinal, it was just… Tsst! Tsst! Tsst! It was like a laser. It was just like fucking SEAL Team Six taking out Osama bin Laden. Just, “Got him!” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, “Clear! Got him!” Right? And now, 38, my shit is just… Whoo. It’s just… Pew! It’s just like an Israeli drone strike. Just… Oh fuck, it’s a school. Oh fuck, it’s a church. Oh, fuck, it’s a refugee camp. I didn’t mean for it to go there. [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs] That really divided the room. You know, it’s interesting. That’s every issue in America now. Everything is binary now. War, the economy, politics, it’s just two sides. It’s not what the media’s telling you. It’s not rich versus poor. It’s not Black versus white. It’s not Democrats versus Republicans. It’s insane people and insufferable people.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s it! All right? [audience cheering and whooping] [Hasan laughs] You know the insane people. You know them. You went to high school with them. They’re still on Facebook. They have a gun in their Facebook profile photo. You’re like, “Whoa, Travis.” “What up?” “Where were you January 6th?” [audience laughs] They’re nuts. They’re nuts. But Travis is fun. [audience laughs] Then there’s the insufferable people. [sighs] [clicks tongue] A lot of them are here tonight. [audience laughs] Just these dorky-ass, teacher’s pet, hall monitors. Just, “No, no, no, no, no!” “No, but actually.” “No, but tech…” These vitamin D-deficient, mouth-breathing, insufferable lo… “You said this, but it’s actually this. You wrote this, but…” “Did you see my Slack? I pinged you.” These insufferable losers that pick pointless fights. The type of insufferable losers that will go on a daytime talk show like Ellen and get mad at Ellen DeGeneres for mispronouncing their name. I mean, what type of insufferable fucking loser would do such a thing?\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, that was me. I was that person. Yes, that’s a rhetorical question. Yes, you were 13 when this happened. Years ago, I went on Ellen’s talk show and I go, “Hey, Ellen.” “Hey, Ellen DeGeneres.” “My name isn’t Hasan Minhaj.” “It’s Hasan Minhaj.” “Say it right.” “This is the name of my ancestors.” Of course she couldn’t say it right. Because she’s Ellen. [audience laughs] She’s a 65-year-old white billionaire who lives in Montecito. She can’t speak Urdu. [audience laughs] She’s Ellen, she’s not a Sufi poet. [audience laughs] And ever since I fought this pointless fight, people say my name worse. [audience laughs] People run up to me in the street and they shout the wrong name at me with vigor. [audience laughs] Like they’re trying to score points on Duolingo. [audience laughs] They’re just like, “Hussein!” [audience laughing] “Hummus!” “Hamas!” Ding, ding, ding! “Yes! Yes! Yes!” “I knew his name was Hamas!” “Five letters. Starts with an H.” “He looks like a Hamas.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Take me to the tunnels.” I’m like, “I don’t know where they are.” Oh, no. Ian! My life is perfect and I’m out here arguing with Ellen over vowels. Why did I do that? Why did I… Why wasn’t… [muttering] Why did I do that? I was so insufferable. I used to make fun of my Chinese friends for having two names. Yeah. I used to make fun of Ronny Chieng for being an Asian sellout. [audience laughs] Wait, you think Ronny Chieng’s real name is Ronny Chieng? [audience laughs] Look at his face. Look at his Chinese-Malay… No! His real name is Xin Yi Chieng. But he knows if he meets Ian… Ian will be like, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, streaming now on Disney Plus.” So instead…\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n…he goes, “Hi!” “I’m Ronald McDonald.” “Nice to meet you.” “Here to bring shareholder value to the company.” “Call me Ron-Ron.” [audience laughs] Because Chinese people are smart. They know you have to have a Chinese name, and then Americans-are-dumb-as-fuck name. [audience laughs] But I was the problem. “No…” [muttering] “It’s the point!” And it bit me in the ass. I remember I used to close my set with this joke. In New York City it would be my closer. I’d be like, “Ronny Chieng is an Asian sellout, good night!” I’m leaving the club. And this woman in the audience gets up and chases me into the street. She was like, “Excuse me.” “Oh, ho-ho! I could be a normal person, but I have a point to prove.” [audience laughs] And I’m not gonna say her ethnicity… [audience laughs] [audience laughs] …but her name was Ashley. [audience laughs] E-I-G-H. Just…\\n[audience exclaims]\\n[yells] “Excuse me. Can I see the manager?” “Hi! Hello. Hi.” “Hey stop.” “Hello.” “Hmph.” [audience laughs] “I saw your skit back there.” “And I have to say, ‘really?'” “Really?” “Making fun of Asian names.” “These are the jokes we’re making with our platform?” [audience laughs] “Um, Hagh-hen…” “India is a part of Asia.” “Do better.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Ash-league… [audience laughs] …no the fuck it’s not.” “There’s Indians and there’s Asians.” [audience laughing and whooping] “And we don’t fuck with each other.” [audience laughs] “In fact, Ashley-egg… you can’t stop Asian hate because Asians all hate…” [woman] Each other! “…each other,” thank you! “Furthermore, Ashleg-ha… here’s a dirty little secret.” “White people… [scoffs] …you’re not even the best at racism.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Wait, no, don’t get me wrong, they had a lot of hits. They had some bangers, right? Slavery, Jim Crow. Just, mwah, classics. But… But… some new teams have emerged to compete for the title. [audience laughs] See, now this is important. Fact-check me here. See, when white people are racist, they’re racist against people that don’t look like them. [audience laughs] Which is wrong. But it kind of makes sense. Asian people? [audience laughs] We hate people who look exactly fucking like us.\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\nIn fact… if you touch countries with us… [laughs maniacally] …we hate you even more! It’s fucking crazy. Look at us, right? Hindustanis, Indians. Who do we shit on?\\n[man] Pakistanis!\\nPakistanis, right? Pakistanis. You shit on Bengalis. Bengalis, you shit on Sri Lankans. Sri Lankans shit on Nepalese people. That’s just the hairy Asians. [audience laughs] Let’s talk about the hairless Asians, shall we? They’re here. Let’s talk about them. Let’s air it out. Let’s say what we can’t say at the DEI meeting. Let’s just get it out, right? Right? Chinese people. Yes! You shit on Koreans, right? Koreans shit on Japanese people. Japanese people shit back on Koreans. Both of those people shit on Chinese people. Meanwhile, Taiwan and Tibet, they’re like, “Hey!” “What about us?” And China’s like, “Shut the fuck up.” “You don’t even exist.” [laughs] Oh. Oh. You think Fox News dads are the problem? You think Ian’s dad is the problem? [laughs] Really? Try talking race relations with an Indian or Chinese father. Try asking this Indian uncle what he thinks of Black people. Oh, fuck!\\nOh, ho-ho! Oh!\\n[audience exclaiming] Enter the 36 chambers of fucking insanity. Try… [laughs] He’ll be like, “The phones are locked, right?” It’ll be fucking crazy. Try explaining George Floyd to an Indian dad. Oh, I did. Oh, we all did. June, 2020. I’m upstairs in Sacramento, in my childhood bedroom. My dad runs into my bedroom panting. “Oh my God, Hasan, are you watching the news?” “Why is Target on fire?” [audience laughs] This was his line. Target is ablaze. The civil war has begun. Where will I get my towels to hang over my Peloton? [audience cheering and whooping] And I was like, “Dad, stop it.” This is an important moment in our nation’s history. For the first time in 40 years, Beige-istan has been asked to pick a team.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd we have to pick a team tonight. My dad’s like, “What are the teams?” [audience laughs] I’m like, “All right, Dad, sit down.” This is important. Let me just explain this to you. [sighs] All right, Dad, there’s two teams. All right? So there’s Black Lives Matter. All right? Black people are saying, “Hey, treat us like human beings.” Then there’s All Lives Matter. And they’re like, “Hey.” “No!” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Those are the teams. Which team do you wanna pick? And he’s like, “Hasan, both of these people are idiots.” No one matters. [audience laughing and whooping] What? “What’s your GPA? I’ll tell you if you matter.” I mean, this dude is fucking Thanos. I go, “Dad, never say this in public. Don’t go to work and say this.” “We live in America.” “This is a multiracial democracy, Dad, all right?” “We’re trying to unspool the vestiges of white supremacy.” He’s like, “Hasan, white supremacy isn’t real.” “Don’t let them colonize your mind, man.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Come to my office.” You know, every dad has an office. It’s just some room in the house with dusty filing cabinets and a Windows 95 CD-ROM drive. He goes, “Hey, come sit before my Compaq Presario that I’ve had for the past 28 years.” “Sit here. I have to teach you a lesson.” My dad, on his computer, has pulled up a PDF of the US census. It is queued up to income by ethnicity. He’s like, “Read it.” [speaks in Urdu] Okay. These are the highest earners by ethnicity. Number one. Indian Americans. [audience cheering] Average dual, median income, $120,000 per year. [man] Wow. I know, that’s nothing in the Bay. [audience laughs] [laughs] I heard a guy, “Wow.” Number two. Distant second. [audience laughs] Whites. Parentheses, non-Hispanics.\\n[audience laughs]\\nRacist. Yo, the US government is so racist. They’re like, “None of you light-skinned, Bad Bunny-looking Latinos.” “None of you Ricky Martin, Pau Gasol-looking Latins.” “We want purebred, Viking, Mayflower white.” Average dual, median income, $76,000 per year. My dad goes, “Hasan, you see that?” [audience laughs] “Ha. Even on their best day, the white man is three-fifths of an Indian.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] I know. Yo! Bars, Dad. Fucking bars. Up top, Pops. Up top. He’s like, “Now look how much Jews make.” I’m like, “No, no, no. I’m not doing that.” “Come on, man. It’s for research.” I go, “That sounds worse.” Don’t say it’s for research. But that’s my dad. He’s Mufasa, I’m Simba. He lives within me.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd now I have a four-year-old son. I can’t teach him that. [laughs] I can’t be like, “Hey, son, no one matters.” Mwah! “Go live your life.” [audience laughs] “Life is nothing but an elephant graveyard.” I can’t do that. I remember I was back home in Sacramento. I was visiting my parents because they have diabetes. [audience laughs] This is a powerful moment in my life. Because I have two children now. I have my kids and I have my parents. [audience laughs] I’m sitting in between. We’re sitting on the couch. Seventy-four-year-old dad. Four-year-old son. I’m in the middle. And they’re both just screaming into their iPads. [audience laughs] They’re like, “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” Right? I’m like, “I’m here, don’t you cry.” “Don’t you cry.” [speaks in Urdu] “Don’t you cry. I’m here.” I’m the halftime show. I have to figure out, what am I taking from this old man and passing on to my son? What is some shit I got to delete?\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s our biggest challenge, right? How do we break generational trauma? We have to figure out, what’s an heirloom that we take from our past and pass on? And what is some baggage we gotta leave at Goodwill? [audience laughs] Because our parents, they fucked us up. They gave us a lot of baggage. But at the same time, there’s a lot of beautiful heirlooms that our parents gave us in Beige-istan that we took for granted. Uncle, we took this for granted. Here’s something you gave your children that they took for granted. No matter how bad you fuck up in Beige-istan, tax evasion, fraud, stand-up comedy… [audience laughs] …you can always go home. In fact…\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n…our parents’ greatest dream would be if we never left home. I’m almost 40 years old. I have a wife, I have two kids. My mom’s greatest dream would be if I moved back upstairs to my childhood bedroom. Just quietly having an orgasm underneath the Scottie Pippen poster, just… Just, “Oh, babe, keep it down.” “Sweetheart, my mom’s downstairs. Just be quiet.” My mom would be thrilled. “Wow, my son is climaxing under Toy Story sheets.” “This is what I always wanted.” “Our khandan is together.” She would come in with sliced fruit, just… “Kids, do you want apples?” I’d be like, “Mom!” [audience laughs] “I told you, I like peanut butter!” [audience laughs] “Bring me peanut butter!” But Ritz-cracker Americans? Purebred capital-A Americans? No, no, no, no, no. Zero to eighteen, you get to live at home. The day you turn 18… I’ve been to the graduation party. Dad gets on the mic. “Travis!” “Ha, ha. Happy graduation, bud.” “Get the fuck out of my house!”\\n[audience whooping]\\n“The next time you walk through that door, you better PayPal me, bitch.” I mean, this… [audience laughs] This is why there’s so many homeless people in America. None of these people can go home. [audience laughs] Oh, are you getting uptight? You getting uptight? Really? Really? Let me ask you a question, San Jose. Have you ever seen an Indian homeless person in America? [audience cheering and whooping] Huh? No. Hey, I’ll bet you a Kia Carnival. [audience laughs] Let’s go to the worst part of the Bay… Let’s go to the Tenderloin tonight, all right? Just imagine seeing a 5’7″ bespeckled Indian man. Cardboard cutout, “Hungry, homeless.” “I need help.” You’d be like, “Rajif?” [audience laughs] “Go home.” [audience laughs] “Come home. Live… What are you doing? Get in the car.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, to be fair. To be fair… There are a lot of Indian homeless people in India. [audience laughs] There’s like a lot. They’ve won the Oscar, they made documentaries, it’s crazy. [laughs]\\nWhere’s your family from originally?\\nBangalore.\\nBangalore? Ever been back?\\nYeah. You remember when you go back to the motherland, back to Beige-istan, and you’re sitting in the rickshaw with your mom the first time.\\nRight? 17, you’re young.\\nThey walk up… Yeah, then the kid with one arm walks up to the… Starts banging on the window with the stub, just… “Madam! Madam!” “Please, madam, please!” [speaks in Urdu] “Give me one rupee, please.” Then your mom, she’s a piece of shit. She goes, “Don’t look at them!” “Don’t you look at them. They’ll steal your soul!” “Don’t look at them!” And she goes, “I’m sorry!” “I’m sorry, I don’t have any money. I have to buy jewelry.” [audience laughs] “I have to buy bangles. Do you understand?” “See, bangles, they go on your arms.” “But you don’t have any arms, so you wouldn’t understand.” [audience laughs] “And me getting bangles is more important than you eating.” Am I lying? Am I lying? Go into any Desi woman’s closet. That shit is like the cave scene from Aladdin, just… “Touch nothing but the lamp.” I mean, auntie, look at you. Just fucking bedazzled. You just robbed pirates. Look, just… Ah! Just fucking rapper bling. [audience laughs] You know all those kids, right?\\n[boy] Huh?\\nYou know, when you sit in the rickshaw. And all those kids surround your car like The Walking Dead? [hisses] Right? [audience laughs] They’re all related. They’re all family. That’s what I want for my kids. [audience laughs] I’m not giving them shit. I want them to beg as a family. [audience laughs] But they can live with me. That I will allow. Mi casa, su casa. Come and go as you please. No boundaries. We don’t believe in boundaries. [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, let me ask you a question. Watch me hit this… This is a Tim Duncan bank shot. Watch me land this joke perfect. Okay? I’m 38. He’s 17, right?\\nWhat’s your name?\\nSunaad.\\nWhat’s that?\\nSunaad. Sunaad? Watch this. Sunaad, growing up, could you close your bedroom door and then lock the bedroom? Of course not! This is what I’m talking about! No! If I… [audience cheering and whooping] If I locked my bedroom door, that shit would turn into The Shining within sec… “Hey! Hey! Hey!” “Are you watching pornography?” And it’s like… [audience laughs] [audience whooping] I am. [audience laughs] But it’s none of your business. “Never lock the door!” Why? Why? Uncle, why? What’s the logic? Why? Why can’t we… It doesn’t make sense! “Never lock the door.” I tried to explain this to my… “Dad, what if I have to go to the bathroom and take a dump?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Then close the door.” “But don’t lock it.” [audience laughs] “I might have to take a shower.”\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\nYou laugh. No, no, no, you laugh. That’s how much my dad loves me. He’s willing to take a hot shower in my shit fumes. [audience laughs] Just… [singing in Urdu] [imitates farting] That is love. [audience laughs] You wish your dad knew your scent, Ian. But no. No, no, no. In Caucasia, you love your boundaries. “Boundaries!” “Hey, Mom? Boundaries!” “Mom? Hey, bitch, these are my boundaries, you bitch.” “I know I ripped through your vagina to your taint, but these are my boundaries, you bitch.” Not only are you obsessed with emotional boundaries, you’re obsessed with physical boundaries. You literally pick the boundaries for the entire world. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh…” [audience whooping] “Africa, here are your boundaries.” “Asia, here are your boundaries.” “Middle East, here are your boundaries.” “Peace.” No, there’s no peace. [audience laughs] We’re around the corner from the election. What’s the biggest issue that the Republicans are using in regards to your safety?\\n[man] The border.\\nThe border. [audience laughs] A bunch of Republican senators are out here acting like hormonal teenagers. They’re like, “Hey, Mexico.” [audience laughs] “Respect our boundaries.” [audience laughs] Then there’s a bunch of Mexican uncles at the border. They’re like, “Señor, why is the door locked?” [audience laughs] [speaks in Spanish] “Why is the door locked? Esta es mi casa.” “Don’t ever lock the door!” World War III is about to pop off because disputes over what? Boundaries! Boundaries. That’s gonna be the downfall of Western civilization. Sunaad, do you know what our downfall will be? [man] What? Hoarding! [audience laughs] Our parents love to hoard. [man whoops] Everything, just fucking Subway napkins. Ha, ha! Taco Bell fire sauce. Red crushed pepper from Dominos.\\nJust poverty mentality.\\n[audience cheering and whooping] Go into any immigrant household. Go to the drawer next to the spoons. [audience cheering and whooping] “Why do you have six kilos of Parmesan cheese… [audience laughs] …from Round Table Pizza?” “You can take my green card, but you can’t take my Parmesan cheese!” [man whoops] Not only do our parents physically hoard, they emotionally hoard. [audience laughs] Oh, every grievance, every trauma. Right here. Right here. Every time you fuck up, “I’ll remember.” They never clear cookies and cache. [audience laughs] My parents, they’ve been together 40 years. Okay, they’ve been adjacent for 40 years. [audience laughs] I’ve never seen them hug. I’ve never seen them kiss. They’re just planking in their stubbornness. Just, “Fuck you!” “No, fuck you!” “Fuck you!” “You die!” “No, you die, that way I get the house and I can talk shit about you to the grandkids!” I had to have an intervention. I go, “Mom, Dad!” “You clearly don’t like each other.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You obviously don’t love each other.” “So either get a divorce, or go to therapy.” And my dad’s like, “Hasan, I’m not paying someone $200… [audience laughs] …when we can argue in this kitchen for free.” [audience laughing and whooping] And now I’m in therapy. Because I don’t wanna end up like them. But here’s the thing, I don’t think it works. Do you have friends that are in therapy, but they’re still shitty people? All my friends that are therapied up are the most mentally ill people that I know. They’ve just learned fancy words to avoid accountability. I have a friend that still owes me money for a concert. I tried to call him on it. I was like, “Scott, you owe me $350.” He’s like, “I hear you.” [audience laughs] “I receive you.” “But I don’t have the bandwidth.” I’m like, “Dammit, Scott!” Get more bandwidth. [audience laughs] Look, therapy’s important, but it is not a flex. Stop bragging about it. “I’m doing the work.” “I’m unpacking my tru…” I don’t need you to unpack. I need you to change.\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\nYou know what it is? Therapy has to be like a haircut. You can’t tell us about it. We have to notice the difference. [audience laughing and whooping] Listen, man, I’m telling you from experience, I’ve done it all. Don’t waste your money. I’ve done it all. I’ve done all the therapies. CBT. Couples therapy, immersive therapy. Let me just say this, okay? If you go to therapy, you deserve a therapist that understands you culturally. [audience cheering] Because I’ve had all the therapists, okay? I had Janet, okay? Janet didn’t cut it. [audience laughs] Janet, big-scarf energy. Buddha statue. She’s never been to Asia. I was her little anthropology experiment. She’s like, “Interesting, fascinating. This is like a trip to the Orient.” “You know, Hasan, every time we’re in a session and your phone goes off and it says ‘Mom cell, ‘ ‘Dad… ‘ You have this need to pick up.” You go, “boop.” “Why?” “Why?” “Can we talk about boundaries?” [audience laughs] And I’m like, “Janet, shut the fuck up.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nYou guys are individualists. We’re collectivists. How do I get you to understand where I’m coming…? “Okay, Janet, pretend this doesn’t say ‘Mom cell.'” “Pretend it says ‘dog cell.'” “Can I pick up?” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Of course!” I’m like, “What’s up, dog? You good?” “Oh my God, Janet, My dog needs insulin.” “Should I give her insulin or establish boundaries?” She goes, “What kind of dog?” “A goldendoodle.” “Not your goldendoodle!” I go, “I know.” [laughing] Oh! I see the dog people are in their feelings right now. [laughs] Oh, shit. My buddy Prashanth told me, he’s like, “Hasan, do not do the dog material on Netflix.” “Dogs are sacred in America.” “Talk about something less controversial, like the Middle East.”\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\n[laughs] But it’s not… No! It’s insane. It’s fucking insane. There are… “I love my dog.” “My dog is a member of my family.” You people are out of your fucking minds. “But you don’t… you don’t get it.” “You don’t get it.” “Once you lock eyes…” No, no, no, I get it. The only reason why you love your dog is because you’re never in trouble with your dog. You’re a piece of shit, and your dog is too dumb to know that you’re a piece of shit. [audience laughing and whooping] You love your dog. And you love your mom. But only one of them gets to live in your home. [audience laughs] Oh, ho-ho, but best believe the day your dog is able to talk, and it’ll happen in our lifetime… [audience laughs] …and he’s like, “Hey!” “Why are your pillowcases so dirty?” [audience laughs] You’ll be like, “Chauncey… boundaries.” [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] What was I expecting? Why the fuck was I listening to Janet give me opinions on how to deal with immigrant parents? We fired Janet. “Janet, you’re out.” “Jithra, you’re in.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nNow we have a South Asian therapist. She gets it. Jithra’s downloaded all the seasons of our culture’s trauma, okay? She knows all the baggage we wanna get rid of. She knows all the heirlooms we wanna pass on. She knows that we’re building a new future for our kids. I remember in one of our sessions, like ten minutes in, she cut me off, she goes, “Hasan, I know what’s wrong. I’m not supposed to, but I’ll tell you.” I go, “Jithra, this is what the fuck I’m talking about!” “You know we love shortcuts.” “Be direct. Talk to me.” She goes, “I don’t know if anyone’s told you this, Hasan, but you’re pretty manic.” “Now, you have something that the eldest child in every family from Beige-istan has.” [woman] Whoo! “The eldest child always has something called, ‘Good kid syndrome.'”\\n[audience whooping and applauding]\\n“The eldest child of the family feels like they have to take care of everybody in the family.” “Oh, Mom needs this.” “Oh, but your dad needs this.” “Your sister said this, but your brother did that.” “Your aunt’s doing this, but your uncle did this.” “And you feel like you have to plug every hole.” “But you’re always one hole behind.” [audience laughs] And I go, “That’s how I feel.” [audience laughs] “You probably feel really anxious around your loved ones.” “I feel so anxious.” [audience laughs] “You probably have a lot of secrets.” I go, “I have so many secrets.” “Dark secrets.” I go, “They’re fucking dark, Jithra.” “Now, if you wanna cast a light on that darkness, we really need to talk about your kinks.” [audience laughs] What? “What are your kinks, Hasan?” We don’t talk about this in Beige-istan. Individual pleasure. BDSM, sadism, voyeurism, torture, humiliation. [imitates whip cracking] Whipping. “What’s your kink?” And I… Acceptance. [audience laughs] That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I don’t want a ball gag.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nI don’t want latex. Just put me in a padded room with my wife and my dad, and have them gently whisper in my ear. “Hey, big boy.” “Guess what?” “No one is mad at you.” [audience laughs] And I will cream my pants. This is my wife’s kink, all right? We’re in a padded room. My dad’s not there. [audience laughs] And I whisper in her ear. And I go, “Hey, babe.” “Guess what?” “When my mom is old and decrepit, I won’t let her live with us.” [audience laughs] [Hasan] Ho, ho! I see a lot of women clapping! Really? Really? I thought we were the good progressives. I thought we support all women. Except my mother-in-law. Fuck that bitch! Really? That’s where our beautiful collective spirit dies. It dies at mother-in-law? Dude, I’m in the session. My wife’s kink is boundaries. I go, “Babe, we cannot have this.” “I know my parents are insane, but we cannot do this.” “Let’s not even be progressive. Let’s be practical.” “If we kick our parents out and our kids see it… [audience laughing] …we might be the first Indian homeless people in America.”\\n[audience whooping]\\nBecause best believe 40 years from now, we’re both gonna be built like gulab jamuns. I’ll have diabetes. Both of our knees are gonna be replaced. I’ll have the CPAP machine. I’ll be 80. Thinking about running for president. Imagine this. Think about it. In 40 years, what if we show up with the CPAP machine and the cane? What if we show up to our son’s door and he’s got a chain on the door? [imitating ragged breathing] Just like, “Oh.” “Oh, hey, Mom, Dad, what up?” [imitating ragged breathing] “What up?” “Son, can we die in your home?” “Oh, Dad!” “Dad, this is a bad time, Dad.” “See, I’m dating this girl from Palo Alto, and we’re in couples therapy, and the therapist says we should establish boundaries, especially with our mothers.” If my son said that about my wife, I would fucking kill that kid. I would run to the car. I’d get a gun. I would blow that fucking door down. I’d go, “Get on the fucking ground, you ungrateful piece of shit!” He’d be like, “Oh my God, Dad, where did you get that gun?” “I got a gun for this joke, you idiot. Don’t fact-check comedy.” “Listen to me, we gave you everything.” “We got rid of all of our baggage. “We gave you every heirloom.” “We still go to therapy. We still fuck.” “You have any idea what you did to your mother’s hips? I love them.” “But you destroyed your mother’s hips, so guess what?” “She gets to die in your fucking house.” “And how many times do I have to tell you this?” “In Beige-istan, we never lock the door.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[“On My Way” playing]\\n♪ Don’t you slow down ♪ ♪ Don’t you look down We’re at new heights now ♪ ♪ All on my feet and my heart… ♪ San Jose, thank you so much.

From childhood memories of watching Goodness Gracious Me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes, class, and multiculturalism in the UK, Shah blends humor and poignant storytelling. The show covers themes of identity, family sacrifice, love, and the generational impact of immigration, all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary.\\n* * *\\n[man] In January 1998, a seven-year-old boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London. Three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the BBC. Now, the boy’s grandparents had had tough lives, right? The sort of lives that clad you in an armour, and it’s the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape. But for the next half hour, the boy and his family watched episode one of Goodness Gracious Me, and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember. And watching Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal, Nina Wadia and Kulvinder Ghir on television, the boy thought, “Wait, we can do that?! I didn’t know we could do that.” “But if we get to do that, then I wanna do that,” because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Over 25 years later, would you please welcome to the stage Mr Ahir Shah.\\nHello! Hello!\\nHello. Hello. Hello. Hello.\\nGood evening, London. Are we well?\\n[cheering and applause] Fantastic, fantastic. Lovely to have you here. Lovely to have you in such fine voice. Hello! Uh, my name is Ahir Shah. That is my name, by the way, right? I didn’t used to need to clarify this, until a few years ago, I was doing this gig in Switzerland… I was doing a gig in Switzerland, and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country, right? I was the British entrant. Very modern.\\nRight? And…\\n[laughter] There was one comedian I was particularly excited to meet ’cause this guy’s name was Ali Al Sayed. Now, Ali is a stand-up comedian from the United Arab Emirates, of all places, right? I’d never met anyone from the United Arab Emirates, let alone a comedian from the United Arab Emirates. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t think they had comedians in the United Arab Emirates. I assumed he’d just be walking onstage being like, “What’s the deal with unspeakable oil wealth?”\\n[laughter]\\nHe’s a very nice man, a very funny man. After the show, all the comedians, we’re all backstage hanging out. We’re all having a laugh, having a drink. Not Ali, obviously. Right, and… We get to talking, and he says to me, “Like, uh, listen, bro.” “We’re friends now. I can ask you a question.” “You’re not gonna get offended.” I’m like, “Listen, brother.” “You’re from Dubai. I’m of South Asian origin.” “As long as the question you have for me is not, ‘Do you want a job on a construction site?'”\\n[laughter]\\nIndustrialised slavery. “You can ask me whatever the hell you like.” He’s like, “Nothing like that. I was just wondering.” “When did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name Ahir Shah?” Right? I was like, “To be honest, I don’t remember, but it was probably 28th December 1990 when I plopped out of Mrs Shah, and she and Mr Shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy Ahir.” “I think that’s about when I started going by Ahir Shah.” He’s like, “Right, right, okay.” “One thing you should know, in case you’re ever in my neck of the woods, is that in Arabic, your name means Prostitute King!”\\nHe wasn’t even fucking with me. Ahir Shah is “prostitute king” in Arabic. There are several reasons I didn’t think my career would go stratospheric in Saudi. Humble enough to know that I don’t have the best bone-saw material on the circuit. That’s Romesh, and fair enough. Right, but, uh… I put this to the back of my mind for several years, as you would, until, uh, November 2022. I was in Egypt doing some work around the COP climate conference. They speak Arabic in Egypt, and I don’t know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as “Monarch of all Pimps”?\\nReally changes the vibe in a lobby, in my experience. They think you’re selling something very different to what you are. Anyway, that’s me, then. Ahir Shah. Prostitute King to my friends. Mr Shah to you, and, uh… It’s been a while since I’ve done a big show like this. A lot’s changed in the world, in my life. A lot’s changed in my life. I’m now very much in my thirties now. That’s exciting. Shit started falling apart way younger than I was led to believe, by the way. I thought I had another good decade left in me. As it stands, everything’s already just crumbling. My knees are already fucked. Absolutely no idea what’s going on there. I’m trying desperately to get a referral from my GP, right… Sorry, for younger people… Right, um, a GP… Right… So a GP was a service where, like…\\nYoung fellow. How old are you, mate?\\nTwenty-two. Twenty-two. So you might remember but in the same way you remember iPods. You never had one, but you’re vaguely aware they existed. Okay, so basically, like, a GP was this, like… Right, imagine you’re a bit poorly. Not super poorly but a bit poorly. What would happen was there was this number you called, and someone answered, right, and, uh… Not even necessarily at eight in the morning. Any time during business hours. Very forthcoming. Uh, so you’d call them, and you’d be like, “Oh, I’m a bit poorly,” and they’d be like, “Ah, cool. Come see us, soon.”\\nRight? And so a couple of days, days, a couple of days later, what would happen was you went over to this… Right. It looked like a semi-detached house. It wasn’t. That was the first trick they played. It’s like a sphinx’s riddle. Past that, you were golden. You’d arrive, like, 10, 15 minutes early. You’re a conscientious person. And you’d sit in a sort of, uh, waiting room, and after about 10, 15 minutes, someone would call your name, and you’d go to a separate, smaller room, and there would just be one guy in there, and he would be like… I mean, he would, right? ‘Cause we’ve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard. Right? And you’d tell this person what sort of poorly that you were, and this was a very well-educated person, so you could just be fixed then and there, but occasionally, it’d be a slightly more complex health need, and you’d get a referral to a hospital, right? Sorry. Right. A hospital. Now… Have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends? Right? That is a building known as a “hospital”.\\nFunny word, isn’t it? Interesting thing. You were born in one. You’ll die in one. Between then, you’re fucked. Sorry. Right, uh, basically that… I’m obviously being slightly disingenuous. There are quite a lot of them. Generally speaking, they were all either built or done up when the prime minister’s name was either Attlee, Wilson, or Blair. Not sure why. Not sure why! It’s just a coincidence, isn’t it? What possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things? Fourteen fucking years! Fourteen wasted fucking years! Like, not entirely wasted, obviously. There have been some genuine achievements of Conservative government. I mean that entirely sincerely, by the way. My favourite of which is, like… Basically, it’s funny. If you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data, over the last 14 years, the Tories so successfully decarbonised the British economy and energy mix, including all imported emissions, that if the countries responsible for the lion’s share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as we’ve been over the last 14 years, global warming basically wouldn’t be a thing. The Tories did that. They did it on purpose. It is spectacularly impressive, and they can’t admit it ’cause they think it sounds gay. Other than that, it’s slim pickings out there. Really is. Genuinely. It’s worse than it’s been my entire adult life, for sure. Listen, the vibes are awful out there. We’re genuinely skint, as a collective, in a way that we weren’t in 2010 ’cause, basically, in 2010, the Conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the British economy and society. That they then spent the next 14 years ensuring were true. Right, and… Is it… We need an election, yeah. We need an election. At this stage, I would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of one-man dictatorial rule, provided that the man in question was Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, right?\\n[whooping and applause]\\nI love that guy! I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn much.\\nDo you sign up to his email?\\nOh yeah. You do? You’re a good citizen. Well done, sir. If you do not sign up for it, do your bit for your country. That man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink. Right. I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn… So, for the uninitiated, Martin Lewis, he’s a money-saving expert, and he runs this website called MoneySavingExpert.com, and you get a weekly email, and it’s about money saving and the expertise therein, right? And, um, basically, Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, he set up his business for £80, right? Eight-zero. That’s all it cost. He is now worth 100 million, right? Isn’t that amazing? He gives a lot away to things like Citizen’s Advice ’cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge. I love that for Martin Lewis. I love that Martin Lewis is rich. Right? Here’s the thing, right? The reason I love it is that Martin Lewis is basically the only person I can think of who’s got properly rich from helping. Do you know what I mean? Take a second to dwell on how rare that is, broadly speaking. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping, is there? We all know that. There’s money in hindering, for sure. Right? There’s no money in helping. Right? When’s the last time any of you were walking down the street and went, “Oh my god, a Lamborghini! Who does that belong to?” And someone’s like, “The lollipop lady.” Right? It doesn’t happen. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping unless you’re Martin Lewis. Because that man is rich as balls, and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like, “Pizza Express. 2 for 1 on Wednesday.” “Dough balls are on me. Don’t worry about it.”\\nIt’s gonna take more than Martin Lewis to save us now, the state that we’re in. It’s really bad out there. And it’s weird for me because at the same time as the country I love is so visibly on its knees, I am personally happier than I have ever been in my entire life. And the two things are entirely unconnected, but still, feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful. Do you know what I mean? I’ve not done it on purpose, but it’s like having Chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral. The reason, ladies and gentlemen, that I am happier than I have ever been is that in October of last year, I got married. Yeah. Honestly, she’s the single best thing ever to happen to me. I love her with all my heart. She’s a civil servant. I’m in it for the pension. You have to understand I’m a self-employed man. Before I met her, my retirement plan was just to not live that long. Whereas now, my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day I die. Right? That’ll be a new personal best, mate. In this economy, I’ll try anything, right? I’d always known that I wanted to get married eventually. I guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well. I don’t know what to tell you. In Asian families, you get married, you stay married. It’s just what happens. Some of you may know this from your own families, maybe friends’ families. You might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the case, so I’ll give you the best example I have. I started doing stand-up comedy when I was a teenager, right? When I was about 17 years old, I was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the Hackney Empire theatre in East London. That’s a very big theatre. 1500 people. Some of you may well have been. It’s the coolest thing that had ever happened to me. I was on in the first section, so I invited my mum, my dad and my sister to come watch, and they saved me a seat so I could watch in the second section. And the reason I was invited in the first place is that the Hackney Empire were putting on an evening of British Asian stand-up, and I, as the new kid on the block, they were like, “Let’s give little Ahir a go.”\\nThat’s nice, isn’t it? And so the whole audience, sold-out show, 1500 people, all British Asian. All of the performers, British Asian, apart from… right… about two hours before the show started, one of the acts suddenly had to drop out. Now, this is the noughties. It’s not like nowadays where everyone’s got email on their phones. They had to ring around, try and find a replacement. A replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian Joe Bor. Right? Now, Joe is a very nice man. He’s a very funny man. What Joe is not is a British Asian man. Right? What Joe is is a Jewish man. Clearly, with two hours on the clock, one of the organisers was like, “Fuck! I…” [muttering] “I think Jews are basically Asian. I…”\\nListen, I’m not saying there aren’t similarities between the communities. My best mate’s Jewish. We’ve been mates since we were 14 years old, and it’s ’cause the first time we met, he told me about his mum, and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadn’t thought of yet. There’s one crucial difference between the communities, as my friend the comedian Joe Bor found out to his dismay that evening. Because my friend the comedian Joe Bor walked onstage in front of 1500 brown faces and opened with the line, “My parents are divorced.” “Gimme a cheer if your parents are divorced.”\\nFucking nothing! Not a single sound from 1,500 people. I will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my 17-year-old ear, “Bless him. He has no idea who he’s talking to.”\\nSo what happens in Asian families, for better or for worse, you get married, you stay married. I come from a very long line of very long-married people. Uh, my parents met at a mutual friend’s birthday party in India in 1979. Fell in love at first sight. My dad proposed that night. They have been married for almost 45 years. Right? Um… By the standards of my mum’s family, by the way, my parents had had quite an extensive courtship, uh, prior to that. I mean, like, well, her parents, my maternal grandparents, Nanaji and Nanima, I mean, the first conversation they had with one another, just, like, one-on-one, was on the night, like, several hours after they were already married, right? It’s 1955 in India. It was arranged. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, they weren’t complete strangers to one another. That would be silly. It’s, like, the families had exchanged a photograph. Uh… Right? And, um… these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them. Imagine getting shown that when you’re, like, 19, 20.\\n“Is this who you’d like to marry forever?”\\n“Oh yeah, I guess.”\\nThen, in the end, very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young. It’s so funny talking about this in front of liberal London audiences. Like, it’s just like, you all know that outwardly you have to be like, “Oh.” “The mysteries of the East.” Uh… “A rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our own.”\\nInternally, you’re all just thinking, “That’s fucking barbaric.”\\n“The thing is, that’s fucking barbaric, sorry.” “You mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens, and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information, and within a matter of days, they were in bed together?” “That is fucking disgusting.” “We would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary, enlightened Western…”\\n[laughter and applause]\\nSorry, just because you’ve decided to do it via algorithm, not “old woman in your village”, does not make it less arranged, right? All you’ve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable, all right? My wife and I obviously had a far more conventional relationship, uh, prior to getting engaged, meeting in this country and whatnot. It took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question, as they say, mate. We were going out five weeks, and I asked her to marry me. Um… I get shit done. There’s no point pissing about if you know you know. So just get it… get it done. No point leaving stuff on your to-do list for six months. Things are worth doing quickly and well. It’s the single best decision I ever made. Absolutely no downside. Admittedly, we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because, like, our tenancy agreements didn’t… Spent half my life on a fucking bus. Then, eventually, obviously, we were able to finally move in together, but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in London joining households, so now, we rent one roof that contains two copies of every Ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownership. [chuckles] I love my Ottolenghi books though. Not giving those up, even for a house. Might need the spares. Love my Ottolenghi books. Hey, mate, you got an Ottolenghi book?\\nAh yeah, I love it.\\nYeah? That’s the sort of thing you can afford when you get the Martin Lewis email. Love my Ottolenghi books.\\n“For this recipe, you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a Persian widow.”\\n“Or, if they don’t have that in a shop near you, just any lime.”\\nThe thing is, you think it’s bullshit, but I got some of the widow limes, and you can taste the grief. It’s good stuff, actually. The salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour. I think that, shy of having children with someone, I think getting engaged, getting married, it’s like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on the future. Just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say, “Our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of them.”\\nThat’s an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel, right? At the same time as it feels like we’re embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime, it feels like the country around us has just given up. You know what I mean? It’s very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders, isn’t it? It is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country. Right? That’s weird enough for me as we’re beginning this optimistic journey, but it’s doubly weird when I think about the fact that if I were able to get into a time machine and travel to 1964, when my grandfather, younger than I am now, became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores, and I would just explain the present to him, he would not believe me because he would think I was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress. So that’s really what I’m trying to do. To take a step back, view things through a wider lens, a generational lens, get some perspective, not be so blinkered, try not to lose the wood for the trees. ‘Cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the British Indian community. I think that’s a very relevant story to the past, present and future of this country, right? British Indians are, by a very long margin, the largest minority-ethnic group in this country. Hindus, again we’re talking about millions upon millions… None of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate Nish. Right? And… The story of the Indian community in this country, by and large, starts, as it did for my family, in the 1960s and has ended up, in the 2020s, with us now running everything?\\n“Rishi bhai did it!”\\n“Rishi bhai did it! Never thought I’d live to see the day that Rishi bhai did it.”\\n“Got that big house in the middle of town now, baby.”\\n“Rishi bhai did it!”\\nListen, politically, I’m furious. Racially, thrilled. Ah! Are you kidding me? On an ethnic level, couldn’t be happier for him and his family. Increasingly worried about mine. Very much how I used to feel every time I saw Suella Aunty on the television. “Jesus Christ, calm down, Suella Aunty. You’re gonna get us both killed.”\\nRight, uh… I’m gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit. Obviously, I’ve got to be relatively careful what I say about him because we can all agree there’s about a 70% chance that a decade from now, I will play him in a Channel 4 drama. Right, right… Not gonna burn a bridge before I’ve even crossed it. Are you kidding me? I need that money. I just wish that I could get across, like, how wild that day was, right? I… A British Indian, devout Hindu, son of immigrants, became prime minister of Britain on Diwali. That was a very difficult day in the family WhatsApp for me. Get the family WhatsApp up on my phone. Yes, it’s called the Asian Network. See “Dad is typing…” Wait for the inevitable. “Ahir, have you seen what Mr Sunak’s son has done today?” “Still, Ahir, you enjoy mocking your week. I’m sure that’s nice for you.”\\nI’m glad the shine’s come off him now. Everyone knows he’s not really up to it. At the beginning, you all acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. At the beginning, everyone acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. It’s ’cause you just go off the CV on paper. Right? You don’t know what I know. What does it say on the CV? Fucking anyone could’ve done that. What? Piece of piss. Who cares? What? All right, fair enough. What’s the guy done? Fair enough. Does well at school. Gets into Oxford. Does well at Oxford. Gets into Stanford. Does well at Stanford. Starts working in finance. Becomes a multi-multimillionaire in his own right in his twenties, largely through executing positions as a big short in 2007-2008 that makes him rich enough that he’d never have to work again. No one even reflects on that ’cause at Stanford, he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine Indian billionaire, who’s a very successful businesswoman in her own right. They move to the United Kingdom where he becomes an MP at an obscenely young age, Chancellor at an obscenely young age, during one of the worst financial crises this country’s experienced, then prime minister, at an obscenely young age, of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors, leading to complex migratory patterns, in his family’s case, via East Africa, landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith, and everyone acts like he’s the perfect Indian boy. Feel free to look this up. It is genuinely true. Rishi Sunak never made his school cricket team. I was captain of mine.\\n[cheering and applause]\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s right! That is right! Any Indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me. All right? Know what I mean?\\n“Who cares about Rishi Sunak? I want Ahir Tendulkar. Mmm.”\\n“Hearing a lot about Number Ten. Should be batting at number four.”\\n“That’s classy.”\\nHis family came here in the ’60s too. Like, I… I think about that sometimes. Getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in Bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then, not only would this be the case, but I think the bit that he’d struggle with the most is that it’s not a thing. Do you know what I mean? The news was just like, “And the prime minister, Rishi Sunak,” and everyone’s like, “Yeah, that makes sense.”\\nIt is remarkable how unremarkable it is, right? That’s a thing that’s worth reflecting upon. Listen, I’ll always talk about the things we do badly as a country. I think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country. And I do think that when we’re at our best, Britain stands basically alone, certainly in Europe, probably in the world, as an example of what a properly successful multiethnic, multicultural democracy can look like in practice in the 21st century. That’s something that is worth discussing. It’s why I hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment, when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes. It’s why I can’t stand it when people on my own “team”, right? I don’t like teams in the first place, but listen. I voted remain, but whenever people are like, “It was only the European Union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency to…”\\nFuck off! Anyone else in the room ever been to continental Europe while not white? It’s not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy. Genuinely. A couple of years ago, I had to go to this wedding in France. I genuinely… The way people were… I kept asking people I was with… Like, I thought I had something on me. Turns out I did! Gonna get an Algerian president of France anytime soon, or reckon the fash’ll get there first? Same question for Germany, you know? Listen, I think that Britain stands basically alone in this. That’s worth reflecting on, right? I remember when I was 20 years old, walking across the Meadows on the south side of Edinburgh with my friend the Indian American comedian Hari Kondabolu, right? I said to him, “Hari bhai…“\\nI think that when you’re part of any sort of visible minority, whatever that minority might be, what you fundamentally want in life, it’s not necessarily different treatment or special treatment. Rather, it is the ability, eventually, to get to go without saying. To be part of what is. Just to, sort of, get to be normal. I think if you get to be normal 24-7, you probably don’t realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time. And does political representation get us there in and of itself? Of course it doesn’t, right? We know this for a fact. Rishi Sunak, not even the first PM from a minority-ethnic background. First, way back in the 19th century, Benjamin Disraeli, also a Tory, right? Would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary Britain? That would be a fucking stupid thing to say. But maybe these things are indicative of the fact that, in societies, we can, over time, move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying, until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone, which is where it should’ve been in the first fuckin’ place. I have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes. I have been to many countries, cities, continents doing this, and I can comfortably say that Britain is, yes, as the cliché goes, “the least racist country in the world”.\\nIt just says a shitload more about the world than about Britain. Right? And please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point. I think the guy’s a fucking appalling prime minister. He’s, like, genuinely terrible, and no one voted for any of this. It is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment. I do not agree with his politics, but… By the way, that’s when you know that something historic’s happened. People use phrases like, “I may not agree with the politics, but…” [emphatically] No one felt the need with David Cameron. It’s just nice for someone like that to get a girl, isn’t it? Right, but Sunak and Cameron are basically the same guy ’cause they went to fancy school. That’s what explains it. Fancy school, and fancy school runs the country. That is not the school that I think about when I think about the prime minister. The school that I think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away. In April 1919, an event occurred in Amritsar, Punjab, at the time British India, that is now known to history as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre. This is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians, peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very, very small area, and tens of thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians, at least 379 of whom were murdered, probably many more, though we’ll never know the true total, and thousands more had life-defining injuries thereafter. It is one of the worst and most well-documented cases of colonial atrocities of British rule in India. I’ve known about that a very long time. What I did not know about, until an investigation in The Times last year, was that subsequent to the massacre in Amritsar, there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding Amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings, including one that happened in a place called Gujranwala, right? Now, Gujranwala, it’s about 100 miles away from Amritsar. It’s a border town in contemporary Pakistan. And in Gujranwala, again, thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were let out at entirely unarmed… just farmers tilling their fields. And over the course of two days, ten bombs were dropped, including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of “This is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you, so don’t you even think about trying to fuck with us.”\\nOne of the survivors of the massacre in Gujranwala was a two-year-old boy named Ramdas. Ramdas’s grandson is, at time of recording, prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\nYeah.\\n[applause] When… when I think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations, I think about the school in Gujranwala rather more than I think about Winchester College. A punchline would feel distasteful.\\n[laughter]\\nRight? Obviously, I wasn’t alive at the time, but I reckon the way I feel’s basically how a lot of women felt about Margaret Thatcher in 1979. You don’t need to agree with someone’s politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself, and that’s the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow. And you can’t deny that it works. You can’t deny that it… Listen. We’ve now had enough white-lady prime ministers that they’re allowed to be instantly shit! That is a staggering achievement for equality in this country. Are you kidding me? Maggie and Theresa walked so Liz could fly. Liz Truss, actually very important from a representational standpoint as well. Uh, I mean that entirely sincerely too. Think about how many prime ministers there must’ve been over however long it’s been. Did you know that Liz Truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school? Isn’t that mad, right? Like, 94% of children go to a regular comprehensive school. I went to a regular comprehensive school. I believe 94% of prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school. Admittedly, she wasn’t a great advert for us. Right? “I may not agree with her politics, but…”\\nIn case you’re trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent you’re currently enjoying… Uh, well, uh… What ended up happening there was I went to my local comp in Wembley, North West London. I had a wonderful time there, but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other. Very thoughtful of them. Subsequent to that, I ended up going to the University of Cambridge, so I became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman. Uh, uh… A few years ago, I was doing a TV record in Glasgow, and afterwards, I was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian Jamali Maddix. I was there with Jamali, smoking, making small talk.\\nHe went, “You went private school, yeah?” I’m like, “Oh no, I didn’t.” “What?”\\nSo I talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood, and he just looked at me and went, “Hang on, bruv, are you from ends?”\\n[posher accent] “Well, Jamali, one supposes one was.”\\nI’m not gonna do it down. I grew up in a wonderful place. I went to a wonderful school. I hate when people do that down. I… genuinely, it was a really good school. If you avoided gang violence, cousin marriage, it was Ofsted Good. Like, it was a great environment. All the families, by and large like mine. First-, second-generation immigrants. Parents may not have had a lot to give. What they had was the most important. An insistence that education is the best way onward, upward, outward. I think if you’ve got 100 grand, that’s a better thing to give to a child. And blessed with really great teachers. I’ll tell you about one of my favourites, Miss Lewis. Now, Miss Lewis, I think she had previously taught at a private school. I don’t know, but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead. Maybe thought that was unfair, right? And so she set up, off her own initiative, like all great teachers do, off her own bat, she set up, for a couple of years, an additional, optional Latin class, of all things. And I, as you can probably imagine, was heavily involved. This is what I mean about the transformative power of education. You could change everything for young people in an instant. I still remember, like it was yesterday, the first time I walked into that gleaming Portakabin bestowed on us by New Labour, and I sat down, and I opened these textbooks that contained these things that I’d never even conceived of before. I was just there being like, “Oh my God, it’s true!” “Caecilius est in horto!”\\nDo you know what I mean, right? Led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school, which was one time, at the end of term, my boys and I were gonna go cinema ’cause you get a half day. The way that you go to the cinema, you get the 182 from Brent Town Hall. So we were walking to the bus stop, and on the way to the bus stop, there’s this blind alley, right? And a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit, until one of them just stopped all of the others by going, “Guys, Ahir’s safe, yeah? I know him from Latin.”\\nI sincerely believe I am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of Latin class. Uh… [chuckles] Nathaniel, gratias tibi. It’s a great environment to grow up in, you know? Not much cash but a lot of ambition. I think that’s a good way around to have it, generally speaking. And realistic ambition as well. The families just had realistic ambitions. The sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on. The idea that if everyone does their bit, works hard, the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did. That is a reasonable ambition. Parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children. Right, now this is not an unreasonable ambition. I know all about unreasonable ambition. You don’t need to tell me about… I remember once, when I was at uni, entirely unironically telling my mate Ali that by the time I was in my thirties, I wanted to be GQ magazine’s World’s Best Dressed Man. Right? I am now in my thirties and will settle for “Dressed Man”.\\n[chuckles] And that’s a stretch most days. Listen, we all know, fundamentally, that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment. I think that the part that we’ve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice. Now, I might not know much about generational investment yet, but I feel like, through example, I at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school, I would go to my grandparents’ house in Alperton, North West London, and I would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of Nanaji and Nanima. Now, quick note on language. I speak another language. It’s called Gujarati. “Nanaji” just means your mum’s dad. You have different words for both sides of the family. So maternal grandfather, that’s nanaji. As you can imagine, I write a lot of stuff on my computer. My computer refuses to accept the existence of the word “nanaji” and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word “Navajo”. Which has led to three instances where I, alone at home, have yelled at a computer screen, “Wrong sort of Indian!”\\nNow, Nanaji was the first member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties in 1964. He is probably the reason that I was born here in the first place. He is the reason for so much. Even though he died a fair while ago now, he’s probably the largest part of the reason why I ended up sounding like this, right? When he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country, he said to the children, including my mother, “Listen, when you’re outside, you’re not allowed to speak to one another in Gujarati any more.” “You live somewhere called England now, so you need to learn how to speak like proper little Englishmen and women.” “And then if you learn how to do that, maybe one day, they’ll learn how to accept you.”\\nAnd it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears, but this was a very commonplace thing in the ’60s and ’70s. A sort of, like, vocal version of dressing for the job you want. You ever heard that phrase, right? And this has been entirely useless for me, but, like, my uncle is a doctor. Can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me? You’d be fucking thrilled. Imagine that, he’s doing the ward rounds, just like, “Oh, good morning. How are we feeling today?” You’re thinking, “This motherfucker’s gonna cure me in two hours.” “Make lunch plans!”\\nNow, Nanaji could never integrate in that way himself, so I think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically English jobs, right? So for the most part of his career, until he retired, he worked at John Lewis. Worked on the shop floor, selling curtains, fabrics ’cause it’s what he knew from the textile factories back in India. That’s probably the most English place anyone could possibly work. You’re not gonna get a more English place to work than the John Lewis Partnership. Unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big, red bus! “Fair play. That’s the most English place anyone could possibly work.” “You can’t hit us with a more English workplace than the big, red bus.”\\nUnless the first job you had in this country was literally at the baked-bean factory! It’s where it all started. Baked-bean factory in Bradford. 1964, baby. Came over here. Work on those beans. Now, uh, crucially, he did not want to, uh, right? By that stage, been married for just under a decade. Had three children. Had friends. Enjoyed his work in the textile factory. Thought he might be able to work his way up and everything. Very little interest in the United Kingdom. Hitherto no interest in beans, right? But, um… It was my grandmother who pushed this. Like, Nani, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, just…” India at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of. And so she, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, these children aren’t gonna have the life we wanna give them over here, but they’re taking people in England.” “So I need you to go over there. You just work it out, right?” “I’ll stay here with the children. You send money back to us.” “When you’ve saved up enough, we’ll come join you.” “All right. Cool. See you later. Bye.”\\nUh… He just did it, like, pretty soon thereafter. Just went… Like, listen, I like to think that I’m gonna be a pretty, sort of, accepting, thoughtful, 50-50 type of husband, right? However, if, just under a decade from now, my wife is to tell me that I must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when I would see them again, no way of communicating with them, no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety, that would not be the end of the conversation. Right? However, of course, for Nanaji, it was. How could it not be? That’s your dharma. That’s your duty. You have to do it. It’s your duty to your family, right? So he came over, not entirely on his own. Came with a couple of other guys who did the same, left the wives and kids. But they didn’t really see each other that much for a few years ’cause they ran a system called the eight-eight-eight, right? The eight-eight-eight is a system whereby, as mathematicians in the room can confirm, if three men each have two jobs, the shifts of which are eight hours long, and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week, you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work. One guy finishes his second shift, comes back, hits you awake, you go off to your first one, he falls asleep. Do that again and again. Saves two-thirds on the rent. That’s more that you can send to the wives and kids in India. And that’s the largest expense, isn’t it? What’s the second-largest expense? Probably food. But food, taken care of. ‘Cause at the baked-bean factory, they give you a tin of beans. Protein. Very important. For the second meal of the day, they had a big sack of rice, and they’d have some boiled rice in a pot. Apart from Sundays, obviously, because Sunday is treat day, so the boiled rice contained an onion, right? Some of you are probably thinking, “Surely, even in 1964, onions are cheap.” “Anyone could have onions whenever they wanted.”\\nFrom what you have heard so far about my nanima, do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a seven-a-week onion habit? It’s what you needed to do. It’s what they needed you to do, so it’s what you did. Eight-eight-eight, 24-7, 365. Five. Five years. He didn’t see his wife or children for five years. Imagine that. It’s not like, “At least I’ve got a good data plan” or something like that. Forget about calling. That was never gonna happen. Letters? Couple of letters a year. Each time you write one, you feel a bit closer. Every time you buy a stamp, you’re driving them further away. To the extent that my mum’s first memory in this country is Heathrow Airport, 1969. Her, her brother and sister all sort of hid behind their mum because they were just like, “Who’s this man?” Right? “Who’s this big man?” Right? Just like, “Why’s he smiling at me?” “Why’s he got these tears in his eyes?” “I guess he looks like that photograph that Mummy cries over sometimes if anyone ever hums that song, you know?”\\nI think about that a lot too, right? Imagine that. Trying to raise three children on your own for five years, occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters. Should’ve cried over a lime. She’d have made some money. Family reunited in 1969, the year after a very prominent Conservative politician got on a soapbox in Birmingham and said, “We must be mad, literally mad, to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents, who are, for the most part, the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population.” “It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre.” Now, Mr Powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. Because that’s quite a mouthful, my sister and I tend to go with “Mum”.\\nImagine that. Bringing your wife and kids into that the year after Rivers of Blood, when you’ve been here on your own since ’64, the same year as the Smethwick campaign. Right? It’s fucking grim. Right, just like the violence, the aggression, that goes without saying. It’s also… It’s always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest, yeah? The thing, I suppose, like, nowadays, we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually, uh, accused of quite serious theft from the workplace, uh, which was, like… Suspended and investigated for ages. Entirely cleared. He’d obviously not done it. But it didn’t take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories, that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like, “Who do you reckon they’re gonna believe, eh?”\\nImagine what that does to you. Like, your dignity and stuff. You have to do it again though. Tomorrow. You have to get up, brave face, for the kids. For the kids. It’s not like the kids have it any easier. There has been so much more progress in the last 20 years in this country than there was in the 40 that preceded it, and I feel very comfortable saying that because I went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle. My abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when I didn’t get mugged ’cause of Latin. Ha-ha-ha. My uncle’s abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it. My mum’s abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something, she has to change her clothes entirely, cook, eat, change her clothes entirely again. No matter how many times I tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world, all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank. And he died in 2002, so he died only remembering the shit bit, and he wasn’t old, so if he’d just hung on, he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different. You could have at least seen a bit of that before you left. Right, in 2016, I’m on a train, reading a newspaper. Sorry, mate. A newspaper. Right, um… Imagine, like, a solid tweet. Right, and… and… On a train, reading a newspaper, and it’s the day before the mayoral election in London, and there’s this big feature article, uh, where basically Sadiq Uncle is walking around the city, meeting the various voters and talking to them. In the feature, there’s this one guy. I’ve forgotten his name. It was a West African name, I think. He’s there with his five-year-old son, and he says to him, “Son, I want you to shake this man’s hand.” “This is Mr Khan.” “Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London.”\\nAnd in that moment of reading that, like, my hands stopped working, and the paper fell from my hands, and the tears fell from my eyes as I thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London,” was completely impossible, right? And yet 14 years later, it had become totally inevitable. So what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper? What would he have made of reading a sentence like that? What would he have made of reading the words, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London”? Probably not much. I don’t think he really liked Muslims. “I may not agree with his politics, but…” And that’s how I felt Diwali before last, you know? Lit my divo, I went outside. I went back into the kitchen, and I poured a little glass of whisky, and I said, “You finding today interesting, eh?”\\nIt’s, like, obviously, problems still exist. None of this is to negate any of the problems that we’re all too aware of, right? But at the same time, pretending that the sort of stuff that I have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me. ‘Cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged, and it’s worth acknowledging. ‘Cause they’re the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible, right? I’m not an idiot. I wander around doing this for a living, all around the country. Occasionally, people shout ignorant shit at me in the street. Like, I’m not oblivious to that. And listen, my wife is a white Irish lady. Sometimes the two of us are going about our business, out and about, and people see us together. They don’t like that too much. They make their opinions known. They’re all so fuckin’ old, right? So old. Like, proper fossils, and… When I was a teenager, it would really… Like, I’d be ready to fight, and now a part of my brain just can’t help but think, “F… I think maybe you lost,” right? No, not… Lost isn’t correct ’cause it’s not like society’s a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the result’s been. But at the very least, I can acknowledge that I’m not the one who scored the goals. I’m a sub. They’re the ones who scored the goals. They scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line ’cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day, they were still, 1969, two down, right? And is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us? It’s worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is, right, because you see people, young people, trying, once again, to sow, sort of, any sorts of division in this society we’re trying to build. And you just think, “What the fuck are you doing?” “What are you doing?”\\nSurely, the point… If the point is anything, the point is to create a society in which, one day, everyone’s children get to go without saying. I think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that that’s possible, and I refuse to be anything else. It’s so easy to despair, right? Despair is the easiest position to have. It’s definitely my default. It just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion. Right? Try something else. Yeah? My wife’s way better than me at this. Like, she’s just, generally speaking, quite stable and well adjusted. I used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something. Turned out it’s because she has absolutely no social-media presence whatsoever. Uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work. If we were all slightly more like her, we’d all be slightly less fucking insane. By the way, no one’s changed their names. There’s no Mrs Shah to this story. Fortunately for all of us, in Irish, her name means “Prostitute Queen”.\\nDidn’t even take five weeks, not really. There was a point, one week, stood opposite her in the kitchen, and just all of a sudden, it’s like the trailers stopped. Like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers, and all of a sudden, every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison, “Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Shh.” [softly] “The picture’s about to start.” And now I get to see how it goes. That’s it. I mean, the ending’s gonna suck. Right. I’m not gonna know too much about it though. 100% gonna die first. Get in! Love it. Are you kidding me? Listen. It’s like… She’s really like, “Oh no, we shouldn’t have processed food in the house.” And all I want to do in my life is fuck a Chicago Town pizza. While chain-smoking and doing lines of salt. It’s nice to feel like you’ve had one of your last beginnings. Yeah? Frees you up to think about where things end up. It’s the interesting thing with love, right? Love, the way that it begins, begins in as many ways as there are people. If we were ever to have a conversation, and you said to me, “Ahir, can I just check, were you in love on your wedding day?”\\nWouldn’t that be a ridiculous question? You’d never ask. ‘Cause the answer’s obviously yes, right? What I find fascinating is that, if you were ever to meet my grandmother, and you were to say, “Ramila, can I check, on your wedding day, were you in love?”\\nIt would be an equally ridiculous question ’cause the answer would obviously be no. Of course she wasn’t. Right? There she was, little more than a girl, sat opposite little more than a boy. Total strangers, functionally. Of course she didn’t love that boy. Right? And yet it began. It began, right? Wild. Did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day? Of course she didn’t, right? Did she love the young man just under a decade later, who was willing to move continents because he knew that’s what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment? Of course she loved that man. She loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children, while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man in Heathrow Airport, 1969, the photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions. She loved that man as they danced together, shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible. For the next decades until his end, she loved that man. She loved that man in 2002 and well past that, as you will know if you go to a living room in Alperton, North West London, and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit. Of course she loves that man. That’s where it ends up. Nanaji died in 2002, a week after his birthday. He’d just turned 69. Oi! [chuckles softly] He’d brought a slightly hastened end onto himself, really, uh… Basically, when he retired, he wanted to spend as much time in India as humanly possible, but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties ’cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills. The place in India my family are historically from, a city called Ahmedabad, it’s incredibly polluted. Makes Central London look like the fucking Peak District. And so he would go over there and come back weaker, diminished. And he came back, and after the second trip, his grown-up children had to get him sat down in his own living room, and my mum had to say to her own dad, “You are killing yourself.” Right? “That’s what’s happening here. That’s what’s… It’s perfectly clear.”\\n“You go there. You come back. You’re weaker. You’re smaller.”\\n“You’re more diminished.”\\n“And can you not see what is happening to you?”\\n“It’s not even about seeing. Akshay is a doctor.”\\n“He can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose you.”\\n“Do you not feel what is happening?”\\n“So here’s the thing. You’ve had your fun. You’ve had two trips.”\\n“But now you stay over here, right?”\\n” ‘Cause we love you very much, so we wanna keep you around.”\\n“That’s how we’re all gonna look after one another.”\\n“So you’ve had your fun, but you’re not allowed to go any more.”\\n“Here you are. Good. Yes.”\\nAnd he had to look at three adult children and say, “No.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I never wanted any of this. Right, I never wanted any…”\\n“Like, my entire life, it turns out, has just been this means to an end, and that’s fine. It’s fine because you are the end.”\\n“So if I had to do it again, I would, with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face, I would do it again.”\\n“But can you not understand that I just need this at my end?”\\n“I can feel it far more than you can see it, or he can hear it.”\\n“Do you not understand I don’t care?”\\n“I don’t care because when I go over there, no one looks at me like I’m any different or yells at me or spits at me like I’m any different because I’m not any different.”\\n“When I go over there, I am a normal guy.”\\n“I have been a normal guy since the day I was born.”\\n“I just haven’t felt like it in so long.”\\n“You don’t understand that when I’m over there, I get to go without saying, and I haven’t gone without saying since nineteen sixty-fucking-four.”\\nHe used to run off the plane as quickly as possible, sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him, and go to the first part of the airport that wasn’t paved over, fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands. He would dig up the earth, and he would put it in his mouth. Can you imagine? Dig the earth and put… ‘Cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth. But you had to leave, you had to leave because that’s what they needed, and if they needed it, it’s what you had to do. He would dig the earth and put it in his mouth. It can’t have helped.\\n[laughter]\\nA third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying. And it killed him. That’s how much every human being wants that. You need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them. When he did die, he died in this country, in a hospital. D’you remember? “Hospital”.\\nAnd my mother was next to him, sat down. He was in a bed, not speaking any more. It was just the beeps, you know? Most of us have heard the beeps. And a nurse came by, saw my mum, and said, “Oh, you must be Mr Vaishnaw’s daughter.” She said, “Yes, I am.” And the nurse said, “Well, listen, I’m new to the ward, so I didn’t get a chance to speak to him, but I’ve spoken to some of the other nurses who did, and they said he was a good man.”\\nAnd my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in Heathrow Airport in 1969 and said, “He was the best of men.” And the line went flat. And if Nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment, then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men. And, like, objectively, he wasn’t.\\n[laughter]\\nDo you know what I mean? Not a baddie, but just, you know, a normal, complex, flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room. And probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for, I suppose. Yeah? But for someone, for someone, which it turns out is the only way that you can be, of course he was. He was the best of people for someone. He did what they needed from him when they needed it from him. He did the best that he could for the people he loved. If you can do that, then you can be the best of people for someone. If you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you, then you damn well get to go without saying, in my book. It is not that I have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement. The truth is what the truth always was in the first place, which is that the sacrifice is the achievement, and with that in mind, I know full well that till my end, Krishnadas Vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man I will ever meet. I have wanted to do this since January 1998, sat on the floor of my grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London, listening to Nanaji and Nanima laugh at episode one of Goodness Gracious Me. And for just over a decade, I have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career. But it’s not the job. Not any more. And it never will be again, I hope. The job, as I understand it, is what Nanaji understood the job to be. He was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be. He was the best of men. And I am now, in front of you, the World’s Best Dressed Man. [laughter and applause] Because I get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat. Because I am finally dressed for the job I want. And it will be the hardest job of a lifetime.\\n[in Gujarati] But with you, Nanaji, I’ll be able to do it, I hope. Sorry. “Hope…”\\n[laughter]\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThank you very much.\\n[Qawwali music playing]\\n[music ends]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAhir Shah, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

[audience laughs] [Keith laughs] Oh, I had two strokes, man. Two! Yeah. One more, I’m gonna be Mitch McConnell.\\n[audience laughing]\\nStaring all… [laughs]\\n[audience laughs] I gotta admit, man, the first stroke wasn’t shit. [audience laughs] I’m like, “What the fuck?” “You call this a stroke?” [audience laughs] Now, the second stroke, oh, shit! [audience laughs] “Now this is a stroke.” [audience laughing] Mwah! [audience laughing, clapping] Huh? That’s what I call “different strokes.” [audience laughs] I should be kicked off the stage for that shit. [audience laughs] [chuckles] There’s a lot of different strokes, there really are, man. This woman was on Investigation Discovery. Right? She had a stroke. And became a psychotic killer. I’m like, “Oh, fuck.” [audience laughs] “I gotta worry about that now?” I’m walking down the street, “Oh, shit.” “Oh, shit!” “Am I gonna murder?” [audience laughs] I couldn’t kill a bunny rabbit, what the fuck am I talking about, man? But everybody… every audience I go to people know somebody who had a stroke. Right? But they think they become stroke experts. ‘Cause they tell me, “Come here, man.” Like they selling me drugs or some shit. [audience laughing] “My Uncle Bill had a stroke.” “He took four cups of green tea with a tablespoon of Seemox.” [audience laughs] “After six months, no more stroke.” [audience laughs] You gonna get the fuck out of my face, man. [chuckles] I mean, I did it, I followed…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] It is a pain in the ass, man, this stroke shit. ‘Cause now it’s like it’s weird, man. I was in Philadelphia taking my grandkids boxing, you know what I mean? I was getting ready to try to park the car when a UPS truck drove and took my spot. My handicapped spot. [audience laughs] Now, when you’re handicapped, you become the Handicap Police. [audience laughs] I’m like, “What the fuck? Oh, no, you don’t.” [audience laughs] And I, like, beep the horn… [imitates honking] And I point to my placket. [chuckles] Like it’s a badge. I’m like… [audience laughing, clapping] He goes, “Get the fuck out of here.” Now I’m mad as shit, you know what I mean? I step out my car, close the door and lean against the car. I’m waiting for him to bring his ass back. I’m against the car trying to get my balance, you know what I mean? He gone come, I see him walking. “Come here for a minute.” He come on the right side. “No, could you move to the left a little bit?” [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Eh, ah! [audience laughs] I could do a one over on him, you know what I mean? [chuckles] A little slip and a turn, mmm! He’d beat my ass though, you know? [audience laughs] A lot of people ask me, “What did you learn from having a stroke?” Well, I learned, you know what I mean, to live in the moment. Live in the now.\\nNever… All right.\\n[audience claps, whoops] Never put off tomorrow what you can do today. In other words, if there is someone you wanna punch… [audience laughs] Punch them now! [audience laughing loudly] Knock the shit out of them! You know how many unpunched faces I left out there? [audience laughs] Oh, shit, these strokes is a pain in the ass, man. I don’t like it whatsoever, man, I’m like, “What the fuck?” You know what I mean? I’m brand new at this handicapped shit. I never was handicapped before, I’m brand fucking new. Only problem with that,\\nsometimes…\\n[cane thuds]\\nThere you go. [audience laughing, clapping] [audience whooping] Now, some of you are clapping like, “Oh, yeah, that’s all right,” while some of you are clapping like I’m at the Special Olympics. [audience laughs] “Come on, you can do it!” Mmm-mmm. Oh. [audience cheering] Hurry up, here… [audience laughing] …white girl. [laughs]\\nOh.\\n[audience cheering, clapping]\\nIt’s good to have friends, man. It’s very good to have friends. [audience cheering, clapping] You know, like, being handicapped, it’s my first time being handicapped. I never was handicapped ever. The only problem with that, sometimes I forget that I am handicapped, but I’m such an asshole… [audience laughs] …I find myself laughing at handicapped people. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? I see them walking, I’m like, “Ah!” [audience laughing] [chuckles] They’re like, “Look at you!” “Oh, shit.” “I forgot, man.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Y’all can laugh, don’t worry about me. [audience laughs] [chuckles] Now I got my trusty cane. It’s noisy as shit. You know what I mean? “Clunk! Clunk!” I gotta put tennis balls on the bottom to stop it being so fucking noisy, man. But it just, “clunk, clunk, clunk.” I’m walking through the Village, all the homeless guys are, like, “Who that new motherfucker?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m, like, “It’s me.” [chuckles] But all of a sudden, people think I’m homeless because I got a fucking cane. You know what I mean? An old white guy… I only have to tell what he did, but he’s white. [audience laughs] He shook his… [chuckles] …boxes of pizza at me. “Mmm?” [audience laughs] “I’m wearing a Tom Ford shirt, you motherfucker.” [audience laughing, clapping] “The hell out of my face.” [audience cheering, whooping] Eh? Well, people… [chuckles] Like, they really think I’m homeless, man. Like, this was last week. I’m walking there. Beautiful girl. She smile at me. I smile at her. I’m, like, “Oh, shit, here we go.” [audience laughs] This bitch… [audience laughs] …reaches in her bag. “Are you hungry, sir?” [audience laughs] “Would you like a sandwich?” “I don’t want no damn sandwich, I want some pussy!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nNo.\\nI didn’t say that. I did not say that.\\n[audience cheering, clapping]\\nI didn’t say it. I thought about it, but I didn’t say it. So I took her sandwich anyway. [audience laughing] [laughs] But usually I wouldn’t fuck with anybody, especially the comics. We’re comics. Anybody can mess with an old man. Ah. You know what I mean? I wasn’t voted the funniest guy in elementary, junior high school and high school because I said nice, encouraging shit. [audience laughs] I ain’t standing in front of a class, “Hey, leave the fat kid with the glasses alone!” [audience laughs] [laughs] [laughs] But everybody can mess with me. Anybody. Like, I see… Comics see stuff, we say certain things. We’re supposed to question the obvious. You know what I mean? Like today, in today’s world, man, like, kids, eight, nine years old, are telling their parents how they identify. What the fuck? [audience laughs] I can’t imagine my son coming to me at eight years old, “Dad, I think I wanna be trans.” “Oh, son, we can’t afford that right now.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “I just bought your ass a 60-pack of Fruit of the Loom, goddamn it!” [audience laughs] “We’re gonna try this boy shit at least three more years.” [audience laughs] [audience clapping] Oh, come on, man. That was not a transphobic joke. That was an economics joke. [audience laughs] Now this is a transphobic joke, right. [audience laughing] [chuckles] [chuckles]\\n[laughs]\\n[audience laughs] Well, everybody like, “Oh, man, you can’t say shit like that.” “You’ll be cancelled.” “God already cancelled my right side, man.” [audience laughs] “What more you want?!” [audience laughing, clapping] It’s all that social media shit, that’s the problem. Everybody yapping. It’s too much yapping. Everybody’s fucking yapping and yapping and yapping. Even so-called gangsters are yapping. “Yo, my name is OG Deathtrap. I shoot at the block.” “I pull bitches by the hair!” “If you like what I just said, hit that subscribe button for me.” [audience laughing, clapping] “Hit the subscribe butt…” What the fuck? [chuckles] But how I got over my stroke, man. I ain’t get over, but how, you know, I got through it. My religion. I believe in God.\\nYou know what I mean?\\n[audience cheers, claps] Any religious people out there? [audience cheers, claps] [laughs]\\nWow, that’s, like, 12 people.\\n[audience laughs] What the rest of you do? Go home and write manifestos? What the fuck? [audience laughing] What the hell? [laughs] Nah, man, I choose a religion with the best afterlife program. [audience laughs] Some religions have better afterlife programs. And some religions got real shitty afterlife programs. One religion you got… you get reincarnated and come back here. The fuck I’ma pick that shit, man. [audience laughs] What if I come back a white guy with a stroke, what the fuck, man? [audience laughs] Plus, I don’t fuck with any religion whose worship service don’t produce R&B singers. [audience cheers, claps] That’s for the Black folks. [audience laughs] You haven’t laughed at a damn thing I said so far, lady. Don’t look around, you! [audience laughs] She hates handicapped Black men, I’m sure of it. [audience laughing, clapping] [raucous laugh] What the fuck was that laugh? [audience laughs] [imitates raucous laughter] [continues imitating laughter] I see the Black… It looks good seeing Black folks smiling. You know, usually you go to a Black neighborhood, they be… [unintelligible] …face, [grunts]. [audience laughs] Black folks, we don’t get along, until we’re in an all-white country. [audience laughs] You’d be so happy to see another Black guy, he’d be a rival gang member, “Yo, my man!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] But I fuck with people, man. Nobody gave me a break when I was, um… when I had my stroke. None of my friends gave me a break. They kept fucking with me, man. I’ll never forget, I went to The Comedy Store, all right? And I go in there, and I’m with my cane, clunk, clunk, clunk. And I drop my cane, and I bent down to pick it up and that bitch, Amy Schumer… [audience laughing loudly] kicked my cane across the floor. [audience laughing loudly] Asshole Chris Rock calls me Stroky Robinson. [audience laughing loudly] That’s funny as shit, man. That is funny as shit! [audience laughs] That’s why I never understood why Jada Pinkett, who’s one of the most beautiful women in the world, got upset that he called her another beautiful woman. Demi Moore is beautiful. But, I know, womens, like, “Oh, no, she got alopecia.” Motherfucker, I had a stroke! [audience laughs] Alopecia is one step above having severe dandruff. [audience laughing] [laughs] [chuckles] That was pretty funny, man, come on. [audience laughs] I remember, like, I… When I had my stroke, I questioned God, man. I questioned God, I… “What did I ever do to deserve this stroke?!” “Oh, yeah, that’s right.” [audience laughing loudly] [audience clapping, whooping] “That time I hit that homeless guy and kept driving, fuck!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Was it the time I robbed those prostitutes?” [audience laughs] Oh, come on, man, come on! You know how many prostitutes robbed me? [audience laughing loudly, clapping] [audience whooping] Especially now! “Where you going? Ah, give my money… Ah, shit!” “At least bring back my cane.” [audience laughs] [laughs] No, but, like I said, when I got out of hospital, I went straight to Popeye’s Chicken, man. You know what I mean? The drive through. I wasn’t supposed to be driving, but fuck it. [audience laughs] That’s why I hit that homeless guy. [audience laughs] [Keith chuckles] Chicken fingers all over the place. [audience laughs] But y’all know, when you go to any drive through, when you can talk real clear, they barely understand you. [audience chuckles] [audience laughs] They got mad at me! [audience laughs loudly] [chuckles] The guy cursed at me. I’m, like, “Can I have…” “Sir, we don’t understand you.” “Well, could you please give me…” “Damn it! We don’t understand you!” And then I got mad. And when I get mad, I can talk real clear.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m, like, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] “You’re Popeye’s Chicken.” [audience laughs] “You sell nothing but chicken!” [audience laughing loudly, clapping] “Guess what I want?” [audience roars with laughter, claps] “It’s not like you have a variety of shit.” “Could I have the duck ravioli, please?” [audience laughs loudly] “Give me my three pieces and let me get the fuck out of here, man!” I know how I sound, man. You think I don’t know how I sound? I know. You know what I mean? My asshole grandson says I sound like Squidward. [audience roars with laughter] He’s a bitch-ass nigga, man, fuck him! [audience laughing loudly] [Keith chuckles] No, look, man, I love him, but I don’t like him. [audience laughs] He gone come at me on Father’s Day. Huh. “You know you’re not my favorite grandfather, right?” [audience laughs] [audience whooping] And I’m, like, “And you’re not my favorite grandson, asshole!” [audience laughs] He’s an asshole. [chuckles] I want to punch him right in the back of his head Soon as this hand gets better. [audience laughs] He don’t know, man. See, people… He don’t realize that my speech… When I first had my stroke, my… my second stroke, when I first had it, man, I wasn’t able to talk for two years. [audience] Aww… I’m lying, man, fuck it. [audience laughs] “Oh. Aww.”\\n[audience laughing loudly, clapping]\\nY’all dumb, little, old faces. “Oh! Oh, no, oh, no!” [chuckles] [laughs loudly] [audience laughs] Ah, that’s what y’all get for the fucking… No, my voice was fucked up, though. [chuckles] You know, my biggest challenge being handicapped… My biggest challenge, man, is crossing that long-ass street… [audience laughs] …with a light with a countdown on. [audience laughing] “Fourteen seconds, what the fuck?!” [audience laughs] “Don’t you have a handicapped two minutes?” The crossing guard comes, shoots a gun, “Wow, go!” “Oh, shit!” “Fourteen, thirteen, twelve, aaah!” [audience laughing, clapping] Ass-old cars revving the engine. [imitates car revving] Now I’m gonna race with an old woman in a walker. [grunts] [audience laughs] “Ten, nine…” [grunts] [audience laughs] Finally get across the street just to get hit by a Citi Bike. What the fuck? [audience laughs, exclaims] Oh, y’all can laugh at me being hit by a Citi Bike. [audience laughs] But the homeless guy, aww… [audience laughs] [laughs] I was in London, man. Anybody from London?\\n[person whoops]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah. Fuck London. [audience laughs loudly] Some of the lights in London count down from seven seconds. Fast as shit. Seven, six, five, four! Had to go back, “Aw, shit.” [audience laughing loudly] [laughs] [chuckles] [cackles] I was in London for two weeks, I only see one side of London. [audience laughs lightly] I never crossed the street, come on, goddamn it! [audience laughs] When I had my first stroke, right, I remember running to my car to call my kid’s mom, Tracy Rome. My best friend, I called her. But I did so much lying and cheating. She didn’t believe shit I was saying. [audience laughs] I’m, like, “I can’t take you to dinner tonight, I’m having a stroke.” “Mm-hmm.” [audience laughs] “If you’re having a so-called stroke, FaceTime me and let me see that shit.” [audience laughs] [chuckles] I had to call looking… [garbled] “Oh, look at me!” [laughs] That’s a true story, man, true. When I got my… [chuckles] …my second stroke, man, I flew from Newark, New Jersey to Arizona to get laid. [audience laughs] First class. [audience laughs] I’m not gonna have a stroke in coach. The fuck I am. [audience laughing loudly, clapping] What kind of animal am I? [chuckles] Like, if you fly first class you know they give you all the drinks you want. You know what I mean? Never stop. No drink minimum, nothing. Bam!\\nBoom!\\n[audience laughs] Slip-slop! [audience laughs] Slip-slop with 15 drinks in. [audience laughs] I’m drunk as shit. [laughs] I mean, time flew past. The pilot makes an announcement. “Twenty minutes left in the flight.” Okay, I’m doing the math. Twenty minutes left in the flight, ten minutes to the girl’s house, total of 30 minutes… What takes 30 minutes to kick in? [audience laughs raucously] [screaming] Answer me! [audience laughs loudly] Viagra, damn it. I popped the Viagra. Men… [chuckles] …never take a Viagra on an airplane. [audience laughs] I was fucked up, man. I was, I fucked up. You know what I mean? I’m, like, “Oh, shit.” My vision was blurry, I’m, like, “Oh, fuck.” I got an Uber. I start passing in and out of consciousness. [audience laughs] But I never panic… [audience laughing] …when I know I gotta make a decision. [audience laughs] “Should I go to the girl’s house and get laid?” [audience laughs] “Should I go to the hospital and live?” [audience laughs loudly] So I’m knocking on the girl’s door. [audience laughs loudly, claps] [audience whooping] She opened the door, I bust in, take my clothes off real fast. I’m in a rush right now. [audience laughing] I have to beat that stroke, you know what I mean? She’s laying on the bed butt naked. I’m butt naked, I’m walking toward her like the living dead.\\n[Keith groans]\\n[audience laughs] [flatly] “Must complete the mission.” My arm goes down. My leg goes down. Only thing still working? Ha! [audience laughs, claps] I should make a commercial out of this shit. “When everything is going down, Viagra stands strong!” [audience whooping, clapping] Now, ladies, don’t ever let me hear you say again in your lives, “We enjoy sex just as much as you men.” Bullshit! How many of you are willing to die for it? [audience laughs] [angrily] Answer me! [audience laughing] [audience laughing loudly] What have you ever sacrificed, lady? What have you ever sacrificed?! Yeah, you! Would you lose your job for it? Of course not! President Bill Clinton… [audience laughs loudly] [audience claps] …sacrificed the most important job in the world… [audience laughs] …for a slice.\\n[audience laughing loudly, clapping]\\n[audience whooping]\\n[audience members whistles]\\n[chuckles] The only thing that got to me, man, is my son. My son cursed at me for the first time. Ever. I’m sitting in my house in a wheelchair. [chuckles] My son comes over. He was crying, man. “Dad.” [imitates sobbing, chuckles] [audience laughs] “We almost lost you, Dad, we almost lost you!” “All for some fucking pussy!” [audience laughs] And I looked up at him from my wheelchair, I’m, like, “Son, are you gay, what the fuck?” [audience laughs loudly, claps] [audience whoops] [chuckles] “Of course that’s what it’s for, what the fuck?” “How do you think you got here, asshole?” I was in the hospital, and a speech pathologist came in. You know what I mean? And the speech pathologist, her job is to see what you can remember, long-term, short-term memory. But she thinks, and thought in her mind, the louder she talks… [audience laughs] …the more I will understand. She’d come into the room, “Hello.” [louder, in singsong] “Hello!” [loudly] “What is your name?” And I would fuck with her, “Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.”\\n[audience laughs loudly, whoops]\\n[chuckles] You should see the look in her face, “Oh, shit, he’s fucked up!” [audience laughs] [laughs] And then she would give me these long-ass word math problems. And she was all excitable. “Are you ready?” [audience laughs] “I’m laying in bed with a stroke, I can’t be more ready, more!” “Here we go! Little Billy went to the store.” [audience laughs] “He had 16 marbles in one pocket, $32 in another pocket, and he left the house with four… fluffy… puppies.” [audience laughs] I’m, like, “Come on!” “On the way to the store, he stopped past his aunt’s house.” “He gave her two of the fluffy puppies.” “He continued to the store.” “Unbeknownst to him… [pretending to cry] …he had a hole in his pocket”. “He lost seven of his marbles.” “What the fuck, am I four years old? Go on!” [audience laughs] “At the store, he spent 10.75.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gravely] Oh, shit. [audience laughs] “He got another pack of 19 marbles.” Fuck! [audience laughs] “All he got was the marbles, the fluffy puppies, and the change.” “What did he bring home?” [audience laughs] I didn’t know this shit before the stroke, what the fuck? [audience laughing, clapping] [audience whooping] [unintelligible] [audience laughs] What are you, a fucking teacher, what the fuck? “Now, see, what he did is…” It’s a joke! [audience laughs loudly] Why do you explain to him? [audience laughs] The what? [audience laughs lightly]\\n[woman, unintelligible]\\nOh, shit. [audience laughs] I just fucked up. All right. Why do you explain it to her? [audience laughs loudly, exclaiming] No, I… My vision is bad from my stroke. [audience laughing raucously] [audience claps] H… Hey, little girl… [audience laughing] I use my st… my stroke for an excuse for everything. [audience laughs] The cops stop me for drinking and driving… [chuckles] “Sir, have you been drinking and driving?” “I had a stro…” [laughs] [audience laughs] “What the fuck, is that alcohol on your breath?” “My medicine!” [audience laughs, claps] [chuckles] “Your medicine smells like Hennessy?” [audience laughs] Ah, goddammit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. [audience laughs lightly] I have, you know… [chuckles] I remember when I… Like, when I went to the hospital, the pandemic was first starting. Do y’all remember when the pandemic first started? I know Black folks, we thought, at first, COVID didn’t infect us. [audience laughs lightly] We didn’t think COVID infected us. We were having block parties…\\n[audience laughs]\\n♪ We don’t get no COVID ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat shit lasted for two hours.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI remember CNN, Jake Tapper came on. [imitating Tapper] “Breaking news!” “More Black people die of COVID than anybody else!” What the fuck?! [audience laughs] Why do we always get the worst of this shit? More Black people die of cancer. More Black people die of diabetes. More Black people die from mountain climbing. “Wait a minute.” [audience laughs] “We don’t mountain climb!” “Yeah, but when you do, you die!” [audience laughs loudly, claps] Like, I was in the hospital for two months. Two solid months, man. Right in the heat of the pandemic. You know, when the pandemic hit, your family couldn’t come to the hospital with you. So I was by myself with me and the nurses. [person whoops] Any nurses here? [some whooping and clapping] [audience laughs loudly, claps] The nurses treated me like shit.\\n[audience laughing loudly]\\nAll those hoes are not heroes! [audience laughs] They left blood samples on my food tray. And I’m now, “Fuck, fuck this. Defund the nurses!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] Except her. [audience laughs, claps, whoops] No, man, I got jumped by a pack of nurses. They fucking jumped me! I wanted a room, ’cause I was falling, like, in the hospital, I fall. And they… start measuring my head. Like, “What the fuck you measure…?” “Well, we’re gonna put a helmet on you.” [audience laughs] “I’m not wearing no damn helmet.” “You’re gonna wear the helmet.” “I’m not wearing a helmet!” I mean, how can I harass the nurses with a fucking helmet on? [audience laughs] You know how dumb that shit looks? “Hey, baby, ahh…” Big, dumb helmet, stickers all around it, like… She, like, “You’re gonna wear the helmet!” “I’m not wearing the helmet!” Matter of fact, take me to the bathroom. And she go and throw me a bedpan. A small-ass bedpan. You’ve seen them. Why don’t you just give me an ashtray, what the fuck? [audience laughs] Matter of fact, gimme the helmet, I’ll shit in the helmet.\\n[audience laughs loudly, claps]\\nAnd so I just threw the bedpan back at her. [groans] But I had a stroke, I didn’t have much strength, so she just caught the bedpan midair. [audience laughs] And she goes and tells me, “I don’t give a shit if you poop yourself.” “You better not get out of that damn bed.” I’m, like, “Oh, shit.” She slammed the door, bam! I’m stuck by myself in my own thoughts. I’m, like, “What the fuck?”\\n“Who she talking to?”\\n[audience laughs] “I’m from South Philly!” [audience laughs] I don’t even know what that meant, but it felt good saying it. [audience laughs] [chuckles] When you are in a brain injury unit, they always keep a camera on you. All the time, they’re watching you, they keep a camera on you. You know what I mean? So I looked right at the camera. [audience laughing] And I put my hospital socks on. You know hospital socks. They come with the suction cups on the bottom. The Air Jordan of socks. [audience laughs] I put them on one by one. [groans] [groans] I wanted to get out the bed. As soon my feet touched the floor the alarm went off. Those bitches came running in with pepper spray and Tasers. [audience laughs loudly] And I’m trying to haul ass like it’s a light, “Oh, shit!” “Twelve… eleven…” [audience laughs] “Ten.” [audience claps, whoops] Some fast-ass Jamaican nurse ran me down. [audience laughs] [chuckles] She was strong as shit. Had me in a full nelson, my feet dangling in the air. I’m, like, “Put me the fuck down! Put me down!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] She put me down. When you have a stroke, you get spasms in your legs, spasms. And my leg just kicked up in the air. I end up kicking this Irish nurse right in the gut. Bam! And she’s, “Oh!” “This motherfucker wanna fight!”\\n[audience laughs loudly]\\n“No!” “No.” “Spasms, I got spasms!” “Fuck your spasms!” And she threw a jab at me, you know what I mean? But I used to box, I just caught that shit, bam! She’s swerving, I slipped it, ah! [audience laughs loudly] [audience claps] “South Philly, bitch!” [audience laughs] But I celebrated too fast. Fucking Puerto Rican nurse was next. She came with a lot of movement, you know what I mean? [audience laughs] Like Zab Judah, she… [grunts] She’d fake with the right, hook with the left. Knocked me the fuck out, man. [audience laughs] Before I went, I heard her say, “South Bronx, motherfucker!” [audience laughs raucously] [audience clapping] Wait a minute… [laughs] Y’all ain’t supposed to applaud for that shit. [audience laughs] I was out cold, man. I woke up, I was in the COVID section. [audience laughs] With a helmet on, what the fuck?!\\n[audience laughs loudly]\\nNo, they did put me in the COVID section, man. No lying, I had no symptoms. No runny nose, no sore throat, no coughs. I think they put me there for bad behavior. [audience laughs] [chuckles] And the COVID section was, like, dark. In a dungeon almost. They ran me through the corridor and all that shit. The ceiling was leaking water. [audience laughs] A guy was playing the organ. [audience laughs loudly] I’m, like, “What the fuck is going on?” And they had a big 70-inch TV with CNN on. And at that time, CNN was showing a death count. And you’d see the clicker. Click, click. I’m, like, “Oh, fuck!” “I see my name, ah, no!” [audience laughing] “I’m here!” They put me… in a room and locked the door, man. And those were the worst days of my life, man. It was horrible, you know what I mean? And none, I mean, none of the NOCs came to see me or anything. Nurses of color. [audience laughs] And there were four Black nurses, I’ll never forget, outside my door, talking. “I’m not going near that nigga, he got COVID.” I’m, like, “What the fuck?” “I can hear y’all!” [audience laughs] Well, I’ll tell you what, thank God, thank God for the white “Make America Great Again” nurses. [audience laughs loudly] They didn’t give a fuck about COVID.\\n[audience laughing loudly]\\n[audience clapping]\\nThey came walking into my room, no masks on, coughing, sneezing. I got nervous, I put my mask on. [audience laughs loudly] They snatched my mask, “Oh, get this fucking mask off!” [audience laughing] Kiss me on my lips, mwaah! That COVID section is a bitch, man. It is. The nurse is telling you, ’cause your family can’t come in, they say… And they show you outside. Or your family can only come and see you if something seriously happened to you, they can see you through a window. I can’t imagine… What the fuck? I’m sitting there, I’m ready to go, I see my family give me… [audience laughs] What the fuck is that? [chuckles] Well, man, I did my time, in the COVID section, honorably. Ten toes down. [audience laughs] All right, seven toes, ’cause I had a stroke, and… All right, fine. You know what I mean? I was an honorable guy snitching on nurses. No, when you’re leaving… the hospital, you know, you’re leaving the hospital, it’s like leaving a penitentiary. They give you all your shit in a plastic bag. [chuckles] And the head nurse was admonishing me. “Don’t come back to this place.” [audience laughs] “You better not come back here.” I’m like, “I’m not coming back.” “I’m gonna do better.” [audience laughs] Well, that asshole Puerto Rican nurse, that motherfucker, going straight to Popeye’s.\\n[audience laughs loudly, clapping]\\nHey, man, thanks so much.\\n[audience clapping, cheering loudly]\\n[audience whooping]\\n[mellow music playing over cheering]\\n[cheering fades]\\n[rhythmic music playing]\\n[music fades]\\nIt’s so easy!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nKeith Robinson, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

All right.\\n♪ (SONG CONCLUDES) ♪\\nOh. Thank you so much for coming.\\nThank you for being here. Thank you for watching. My name is Alex Edelman. I’m a comedian, and I’m gonna tell you a story. I’m gonna tell you a story about something that happened to me. But first I wanna tell you about something that happened to this gorilla.\\nOoh. Okay. So there’s this gorilla named Koko. Has everyone heard of Koko the gorilla?\\nYes. Some for yeses. Koko the gorilla, for those of you that don’t know, is a gorilla that spoke fluent sign language. And in 1999, this is true, Koko met Robin Williams. And a couple of years ago, they told Koko that Robin Williams had passed away. And Koko went, “Koko friend, Koko sad.” Aw!\\nYes, which is sad, but on the plus side, how funny was Robin Williams, that even gorillas are like, “This guy!”\\n“He’s unbelievable.” My comedy barely works if you’re not from the Upper West Side. Robin Williams crossed the species barrier.\\nBrilliant comedian. Also, and obviously, did they have to tell… …the gorilla that Robin Williams had passed away? She wasn’t gonna catch it on CNN or anything like that. I heard about this in, like, September of 2017 and I couldn’t stop imagining somebody walking into a gorilla enclosure, just like, “No. I’ll do it. I’ll do it. Let me.”\\n“Hi, Koko?”\\n“Can you put down the banana?” “We have some bad news.” And they tell Koko and Koko’s like… “Oh, no.”\\n“But Prince is fine, right?” Like, “Get the gun. Koko. Koko, calm down.” And Koko’s like, “Why was the last David Bowie album so sad?”\\nAnd they’re like, “Koko!” And Koko’s like, “What else do you know–” And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like… And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like, “Who is the president right now?” Those are the kind of jokes I write. I write jokes that are so dumb and simple that part of it is like, “Oh, I can’t believe someone took the time to think about that.” “I can’t believe that someone thought that was worth informing an audience of.” I can’t believe– This is true sadly, that in the middle of a pandemic, someone spent 500 dollars on sign language lessons over Zoom… …for a joke about a gorilla. I love a dumb joke. I love a silly joke. It’s my job. It’s my currency. I wrote a joke a while ago that was so dumb, it took a month and a half to realize it was actually too dumb to ever grace a stage.\\nHere it is. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fat horse. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fat horse. Maybe that’s because they get four times as many steps as we do.\\nI… I know, I know. And a month and a half later, I was walking through a Whole Foods and out of nowhere I was like… “Twice as many steps.” They don’t have eight goddamn legs.\\nIt’s twice as many steps. And that’s what this show was gonna be when I started writing it. It was gonna be a show full of benign silliness, like I’ve done my whole comedy life, and then something happened. So, I write radio comedy shows for the BBC. Nobody listens to these things.\\nNo one. People my age don’t even know what a radio comedy show is. Like, I’ll tell people, “I write radio comedy shows.” And they’re like, “What’s a radio comedy show?” And I have to explain that it’s like a podcast, but for the dying. And like, this radio show comes out and there’s this massive wave of indifference, right? No one cares. It’s a radio comedy show. But there are two tweets. Just two. And one tweet’s actually very nice. It’s very complimentary, because the tweet is from my Aunt Nancy in Teaneck, New Jersey.\\nAnd it said– Her fans are everywhere, of course. And the second tweet is from someone I’m not related to. And this guy’s just listened to the show. And this guy’s very upset. And this guy’s very upset, largely by the fact that I… am a Jew. And sometimes people can tell that I’m Jewish because of my name, or my face, or anything about my personality. But this guy’s very upset by the fact that I’m Jewish, and he lets me know, and I make a mistake.\\nI respond to the tweet. I know. And then he writes back and then I write back, and then he writes back, and then other people get involved. And then I go to bed, and I wake up the next morning, and my Twitter feed, it’s just this avalanche of antisemitism. Nothing but anti– And it bothered me. It’s never fun to see that stuff directed at you. And then it stopped bothering me because I started adding these people to a Twitter list. Do you guys know what I mean, generally when I say Twitter lists? A couple of yeses, a couple of blank stares. All right, fine. By the way, you don’t… you don’t need to know what this is. I promise you, it’s an obscure function of a dying platform.\\nLike, you don’t truly need to know. But on Twitter– Yeah… But on Twitter, the way it works is you follow folks. You know that, you follow people, everybody knows. But imagine you’re interested in, like, a common area. Imagine you’re interested in, like, opera or the NBA, but you don’t feel like following a whole bunch of NBA players. What you can do is, you can make a list of NBA players and then follow that list and check it occasionally, right? So I did that, but with anti-Semites. And because of certain issues within the NBA at the moment, there would indeed be some crossover between the two lists. But I made this list of anti-Semites and I like it immediately. I like it for two reasons. Reason number one, let them be on a list for once!\\nOkay? Okay? Even Schindler, not a Jew, we make the list now. And reason number two, these guys got a notification when they were added to the list.\\nAnd the name of this list, and they saw this when they were added, was Jewish National Fund contributors. And I got so many tweets from anti-Semites going, “Take me off your goddamn list.”\\n“I have never contributed to the Jewish National Fund.” And I would always write back, “There’s still time.” “We’re planting a million trees outside of Haifa, be part of the Zionist dream.” And I love my list. I love my list for these two silly reasons, but then I get to love it for a third reason, which is that it’s got all of the worst opinions on it. And that’s one of the reasons you go on social media.\\nRight? You wanna be offended. Right? Same reason you watch cable news. You’re not a moron, you know you’re not getting real news. But you get to be upset. Right? You get to be upset at something someone on the other team did or didn’t do, or something they did or didn’t say. And I have a list. I have a digital terrarium of assholes. And occasionally, with great sanctimony, obviously, I go down the list and be like, “Oh, my God, that’s so racist. Oh, my God, that’s so sexist. Oh, my God, that’s so homophobic. I don’t have any of these opinions. I’m such a good boy.” Anyway, it’s a Tuesday night and I’m doing my favorite thing. When I’m alone, my favorite thing to do is I lie on my couch and I hold my phone like an otter, like an inch from my face. Do you know what I mean? Just a brisk nine, ten hours in a row, just going like this? And I see this tweet from someone on the list. And the tweet says, “Hey!”\\n“Hey.” “If you live in NYC and you have questions about your Whiteness, come to 441, 27th Avenue,” which is in Queens, “Tomorrow night at 9:15.”\\nAnd I saw the tweet. And I thought to myself, I live in NYC. And as an Ashkenazi Jew, I have some questions about my Whiteness. And I’m free tomorrow night at 9:15. And I took a screen grab. I took a picture of the tweet. And I sent it to my best friend in the world, this guy named David Burstein. And I wrote, “David… …do you wanna come with me to this meeting of Nazis in Queens?” And I saw the three dots on the iPhone, that means someone’s texting you back. And then the dots disappeared, then they reappeared, then they disappeared again. And then he called me. And he said, “What’s going on?” And I said, “I’m gonna go to this Nazi bar.” And he said, “Why?” And I said, “I’m gonna listen to everything they have to say. I will learn something. It’ll be fascinating, illuminating.”\\nAnd he’s like, “You’re so brave.” And I was like, “I know, I am so brave.” And the next night around 9:15, I take the subway into Queens, and I get off and I walk to the address of this Nazi bar, and it’s not a bar.\\nIt’s an apartment building. And I thought to myself… “How brave are we?” It was January. It was so– I stood outside this building, freezing, dithering, for like 20 minutes, being like, “Maybe I’m an idiot. Maybe my mouth is writing checks that my butt can’t cash.” And there was one moment where I was like, “Well, obviously I’m in the wrong place.” But I knew I wasn’t. I knew I was in the right place ’cause there was a sign on the front door of this building and the sign just said third floor, but it said it in Comic Sans font, the most radical of all the fonts. And after a while, I sort of rediscover the intestines that I left on the 7 train.\\nAnd I go upstairs… to the third floor of this building. And there’s this long corridor, long, doors on either side of me, overhead lighting, bad. And there’s one open door in this hallway. And when I walk in, the first thing I see in the foyer of this apartment is this older lady. She’s in her seventies, at least, or like eighties, but she moisturizes.\\nAnd like… And she’s got this table in front of her. And on this table is the biggest jigsaw puzzle I have ever seen. A jigsaw puzzle. Here’s how big it is. When I walked in and I saw the puzzle, involuntarily, I just went, “Oh, wow.” And without looking up, she went, “12,000 pieces.” She knew exactly what I was talking about from, “Oh, wow.” And I said, “That’s so much puzzle.” And she went, “This isn’t even all of it.” “This is, like, a quarter of the puzzle. I’ve been working on this part for, like, six months.” And I thought to myself, “You should be further into that puzzle, probably.” Although, maybe White supremacists’ jigsaw puzzles are harder. You know, ’cause, like, all the faces look the same. She’s sitting. I’m standing. We’re making small talk about her tonnage of puzz.\\nAnd like— And she tells me how much like, the puzzles mean to her. And for what it’s worth, I like jigsaw puzzles. And I like people that do them, like, it’s a very, like, thoughtful, fulsome exercise, there aren’t a ton of those left. And it’s even, like, a tidy metaphor for why I’m here, right? Like— Because, as with the world, with a puzzle, you need every piece for a complete picture. You need every piece for a full perspective. If you’re missing even one piece of your puzzle, it is suspect or worthless. But even a metaphorical puzzle, I can do quicker than this lady. Like, she’s making zero progress, and at some point she just went, “You know the last one of these… took, like, three years.” And I said, “Last one?” And she points behind herself, down this hallway. And I follow her finger. And as I go down in, I pass two enormous, framed, framed jigsaw puzzles. Framed. And then to my right, there’s like a threshold. Like a doorway with no door. And when I walk through this threshold, I’m in this living room. And it’s like a… It’s a pretty spacious living room. And there’s, like, a hodgepodge of chairs around, and folks are walking around talking. And of all– Oh, and to my– Sorry. To my left, there’s, like, a big table of, like, pastries and orange juice. And even though I was a little scared, I was like, “Oh, sick! Pastries!” So, I’m eating this Whites’ only muffin. And on the other side of the room… I see this cute girl. And this is how dumb of a moron I am. I saw the girl and I thought to myself with no irony… you never know. You never know, right? You gotta shoot your shot. So, I put down my racist pastry and I went over. And I said, “Hi, I’m Alex.” And she went, “Oh, hi, I’m Chelsea.” And we start chatting and it’s good chat. But a few moments in, Chelsea just went, “Ah! Hey, Alex! The White House! Hmm?” And I thought to myself, “This could go… anywhere.” I actually have a thing for this. I have a thing for this. If anyone ever asks you a question and you know they want a specific answer from you, but you’re not sure what that answer is, there are four words that will save you every single time. Every– Sir, sorry to bother you. Would you mind asking me if I saw the game last night? Did you see the game last night? Oh, can you believe it?\\nWell done. That was very nice. Okay. Very nice. “Can you believe it?”\\nGuys, this works. It’s amazing. “Can you believe it?” It means people’s three favorite things in a conversation. It means I know what you’re talking about, I agree with you, and most importantly, you talk.\\nIt works every single time. By the way, I’m from New England. There is a New England version of this. If you’re ever caught in a stalled conversation with a New Englander, just go, “Fucking Brady, right?”\\nIt works every single time. But this is better? It is evergreen. “Can you believe it?” I have a neighbor in L.A. I never know what he’s talking about. I use this in every conversation with him. He’ll be like, “Oh, recycling!” And I’ll be like, “Can you believe it?” And he’s like, “They should take it out on Thursdays.” And I’ll be like, “Okay.” Or he’ll be like, “Minor League Baseball.” And I’m like, “Can you believe it?” And he’s like, “They should pay the players more.” And I’m like, “Absolutely.” And my favorite one ever, this is like six months ago. He just went, “Hey, Alex, the Kennedy assassination.” And I was like, “Can you believe it?” And he said, “Bobby did it.”\\nAnd I was like, “Oh.” “Well, he got his, didn’t he?” I mean… “Can you believe it?” It is a mirror of a question of an answer, and it works here. Because she just went, “The White House! Hmm?” And I said, “Can you believe it?”\\nAnd she went off on this rant about Jared Kushner.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump’s Jewish son-in-law, and she goes off on how “Kushner and his friends” are ruining the Trump administration and the country. And I so had to stop myself from doing what I desperately wanted to do, which was go, “Oh, I hate Jared Kushner. He sits behind me in synagogue on the Upper East Side.\\nHe’s so goddamn loud.” That’s true, by the way. It’s 1,000 percent true. Kehilath Jeshurun on 85th and Lexington, it’s where he goes. He’s fucking loud.\\nAnd he’s arrogant. That’s the word. He’s so– Like when they call him up to the Torah, he walks up like he wrote it. He’s got a problem, I’m telling you. And– Anyway, she’s off on her rant about the Kush.\\nI’m standing there. I’m nodding, I’m trying to focus more on the face, less on the opinions, you know. And we talk for like 15 minutes. And she does most of the talking, which is a red flag, but not a deal breaker, you know. And after about 15 minutes, I feel someone kind of, like, lurking in my periph.\\nLike I’m being haunted. And when I turn around, there’s this guy standing there. And this guy’s sizing me up with a look on his face that I would honestly most accurately describe as… “This is a Jew!” Like, “I’m pretty sure this is a Jew!” And he said to me, “Hey, can I help you?” As if I was gonna be like… “Yes! Well, I was on my way to synagogue for Yom Kippur! But I got lost and I stumbled in here. Do you know if these muffins is kosher?” But I tried to be neutral and I said, “Hey, man.” And he said, “Can I help you?” And I said, “I’m here for the thing.” And he said, “You’re here for the meeting?” And I thought about saying, “Can you believe it?” But I had just used it, so I said, “Yeah, man, I’m here for the meeting.” And he said, “Chelsea, he’s with you?” And Chelsea just went, “Oh… …we just met, but he seems cool.” And I thought to myself, “Nice.”\\nYou never know, right? And then this guy, like, fumfers for– Like this guy’s not quite sure what to say. But when he recovered, he just said, “Okay. All right. But who is he? Excuse me, who are you? Like, what’s your name?” Here’s the thing.\\nHere’s the thing. Growing up… …I always wanted to be White.\\nYeah, yes. I’m aware there are a few of you looking at me like, “Mission accomplished, buddy.” “Does he not…?” I am White. I’m definitely White. But I grew up in a place where there were different kinds of White people. I grew up in a place where there was a strict hierarchy for Whiteness. I grew up in Boston. I grew up in this really racist part of Boston called Boston.\\nAnd in Boston… And in Boston, there are different kinds of White people, there are different kinds of Whiteness, right? Like, there are Ashkenazi Jews, like me, and we’re in places like Brookline and Newton and an outer suburb way to the south called Sharon, there are the Russians. In Eastie, in East Boston, there are the Greeks. In Dorchester, there are the Italians in the North End. And of course, Irish Catholics, right? ICs practically synonymous with Boston, and they’re scattered all over, but a lot of them very famously concentrate in, anybody know? Southie. Southie, South Boston. Yes. And they’ve had an amazing century. No, truly, an incredible 100 years for the Bostonian Irish Catholics. They’ve gone up a couple of socioeconomic classes as a whole. They’ve had their own president, who was apparently killed by his brother.\\nRight? Like, there’s any reason… But they’ve not ascended to the top of this totem pole. ‘Cause at the top of this pyramid of Bostonian Caucasian, unquestionably? WASPs.\\nWASPs. Exactly. The WASPs. And let me tell you, that is the kind of White you wanna be… …in Boston. You know what I mean? The sort of, like, any country club you want White. Or, like, had a relative on the Mayflower White. Or, like, “I can’t read, but I got into Harvard!” Like, that’s the White you wanna be in Beantown. And growing up, I became so keenly aware of that and I started changing things about myself to appear a little less Jewish. Like, when I was a kid, no one called me Alex. Everyone called me David or David Yosef.\\nMy– My full name isn’t Alex Edelman. My full name, get ready, is David Yosef Shimon Ben Elazar Reuven Alexander Halevi Edelman. That is my full name.\\nI go– Sure. I go by Alex now and my family has noticed the shift. My father’s name is Elazar. That’s the name that he goes by. And he’s like, “You’re not proud of your real name?” And I’m like, “No.” And he’s like, “Why not?” And I’m like, “I don’t know, Elazar. Maybe because it sounds like we’re all in Slytherin.\\nThat’s why.” I have cousins Mikal and Penecost. You can’t even spell their names right in English ’cause there’s no English letter for phlegm. I don’t wanna get into a game of like, “How Jewish are you?” This is how Jewish we are. My brother AJ, or Adam Yitzhak Chaim… …qualified for the last Winter Olympics for Israel. This is not a joke. AJ– I mean, like, it is eventually a joke, but like this… AJ qualified for the last Winter Olympics for Israel. And whenever I tell people that, they always have a few questions. They’re like, “Your brother?” “Yes.”\\n“Your brother?” “Yes.” “Your brother’s an Olympian?” “Yeah.” If you’re wondering, turns out it’s nurture. “Your brother’s an Olympian?” “I know.” “For Israel?” “I know.” “The Winter Olympics?” “I know.” “Does Israel have winters?” “Not really. He had to train in Munich,” in what must be the irony to end all ironies. “What’s AJ’s sport?” “AJ’s sport is called skeleton.” Which is like… Which is like luge but head-first. By the way, my father says on television that I have to inform audiences that AJ is a hero, it’s an accomplishment, and we’re so proud of him.\\nThere. Okay. Skeleton– Oh, are you– No, no, no, no, no. It’s… It’s the dumbest sport in the world, it’s not a real sport, it’s a lunch tray and an icy hill.\\nHere’s… Here’s how dumb this sport is. We went to go see AJ qualify upstate Lake Placid, and this guy from Italy named Cicini, named Jean-Luc Cicini, he crashed at the top of the run, and his little sled went down without him, and the sled on its own finished in fourth place. And I think about that every day, ’cause my brother’s always like, “It’s a skill sport.” And I’m like, “It’s gravity, AJ!” A corpse and some duct tape would medal in this event. You turn on the Olympics and Bob Costas would be like, “Wow, Tom! Look at Simmons keeping his shoulders so still in those corners.” Also, I had no faith in him. No. Like, whenever they interview athlete families, they’re always like, “We knew.” I’m like, “You knew?” “Oh, we knew that Megan was special and she would lead the women’s team to the World–” There was none of that in my house. I made fun of my brother every day. I called him “The Frozen Chosen” for like four years in a row. And then my mom was like, “Stop calling him that.” And this is gonna be too Jewish for a couple of you, but I switched over to “Shul Runnings” and I am so proud. Shul means synagogue in Yiddish. We had T-shirts made. It’s like a whole thing. We’re at… We’re at the Olympics. We’re sitting on this bus from the Olympic village to the venue. And this Israeli reporter was interviewing AJ and he was like, “Adam… …what was it like when you found out you were going to be… an Olympian?” And AJ was like, “Oh, Guri, no one was more surprised than I was.” And out loud on Israeli TV, I just went, “That’s not true.” “It’s not true. I bet my dad 50 dollars that he wouldn’t make the Olympics.”\\nBut he did. He made the Olympics. He’s one of the 30 best skeleton athletes on the planet, out of the 42 skeleton athletes on the planet. And he did it for Israel. And that’s a whole separate kettle of fish, but we are proudly and emphatically Jewish. And it’s a huge part of my background and my upbringing and the filter through which I see the world, but… but… …when I’m standing in this apartment in Queens and this guy says, “What’s your name?” I tell him my name’s Alex, ’cause I’m not gonna give him the backstory.\\nI said, “I’m Alex.” And of course, I said, “How about you, man?” “Like, what’s your name?” And the guy thought about it.\\nHe just went… “My name’s Cortez.” And I said, “I’m sorry, your name is Cortez?” And with a real knife in his voice, the guy just said, “We don’t give real names to people who are here for the first time.” And he looked directly into my face. And I’m trying to look back at him, like not too aggressive, but also not like a coward, and it’s very awkward. There’s like a real moment of tension. But that tension is broken fairly quickly, ’cause this guy just came crossing from the other side of the room and he looked at us, and he just went, “Hey, Matt, we’re starting.” And I was like, “Nice to meet you, Cortez.” And then we start. We start. There was a moment before I walked in where I was like, “All right, if I get scared, I won’t… I won’t try anything fancy, I will leave. I will excuse myself to the bathroom and just go.” But nothing scary is happening yet. People are just pulling up chairs to the middle of the room, and everything’s like a little higgledy-piggledy. But we wind up with like a ragged circle of chairs that doesn’t quite close all the way on the end over here. It’s like a semicircle or like… an anti-semicircle.\\nIt’s… I’m over here. I’m over here. I’m over here. There’s, uh… There are 17 of us, okay? I’m gonna say us. I’m gonna lump myself in logistically. Seventeen of us. Twelve men, five women, including Chelsea, my new love. Chelsea’s, like, two, three seats away from me on this side. This side of the circle, a little bit younger than this side of the circle. But this side of the circle seems to know each other. Much better, a little more engaged, a little more hardcore. This side, of course, has Cortez, my pal. He’s, like, um, five, six seats away from me on this side, jigsaw lady’s sitting next to him, and we start. We start. And for the first 15 or so minutes of this meeting, these guys talked about the royal wedding. Meghan and Harry. It had happened since they last got together, and they were upset about it. And it took me way longer than it should have to realize why they were upset. Meghan Markle’s mixed race. Of course she is. I forgot that. I forgot. You know who didn’t forget?\\nWhite nationalists. They’re very upset. They prefer that he marry a first cousin as per usual. Uh, real quick, I have a connection to Prince Harry, which is that my friend Jack once did cocaine with him in a London nightclub bathroom. All right, that did not get the reaction that I wanted from you. I will sidebar for this. Prince Harry had a cocaine problem. It’s the best thing. We don’t talk about it enough as a culture. It’s in the new book. It’s fantastic. I don’t approve of cocaine, but I love that Prince Harry had a cocaine problem. Because in America, we forget this. But in England, the Queen is on all of the money. So that means at some point, Prince Harry rolled up a picture of his grandmother to do drugs that he bought with other pictures of his grandmother. That will never happen to any of you. None of you can walk into Times Square after this and the drug dealer’s like, “Excuse me, that’ll be 300 dollars.” And you’re like, “Excuse me. Here’s a picture of my grandma at her 50th Jubilee parade.” He’s like, “What?” You’re like, “Here’s a picture of my grandma with Winston Churchill.” And he’s like, “How’d you get this?” And you’re like, “Here’s a picture of my grandma planning the death of my mom.” It only works for him. What are you gonna do about it though, huh? What, are you gonna tell people not to watch the special? Fuck you. What are you gonna do? Just ’cause it’s not in The Crown, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Grow the fuck up. By the way, just so you know, cocaine has no effect on me.\\nNone. Zero. Because I’m part of this generation of over-medicated ADHD children. Do you know what I mean? Like, someone offered me cocaine a couple of years ago, and I tried it, and they were like, “How do you feel?” And I was like, “Like there’s homework to do!” “Do you feel like dancing? We’re going dancing.” And I’m like, “I can’t, I’m putting a bibliography together, aren’t I?” I’m gonna get started on the secondary sources. You fact-check the primary sources. Where are you going? We need 3,000 words on Moby Dick by Thursday. Anyway. They’re upset. And this is a huge group of nodders. Like, if anyone ever agreed with anything, they were like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” And someone’s like, “It’s a disgrace.” And everyone’s like, “It’s a disgrace!”\\n“It’s a disgrace.” And someone else was like, “It represents the sorry state of the West.” And everyone’s like, “The West? What happened to our standards in the West?” And jigsaw lady. Jigsaw– I’m fascinated by this person. Not much for eye contact. Always looking at her shoes, like they owed her money.\\nAlways straight down. But whenever she spoke, you knew who was talking. No one else had a register like this. And at some point, she just went, “Didn’t just happen though, did it? Didn’t just happen is what we’ve come to. This is what we’ve come to. A member of the royal family marrying a–” And then… she uses the N-word. And Chelsea just said… “You know… I’m not crazy about that word actually.” And I thought to myself, “There’s a spectrum of Nazi?” I kept falling in love with Chelsea a little bit. I did, for two reasons.\\nFirst of all, you never know. Second of all– Right? You never know. Second of all, I love romantic comedy films. Right? You wouldn’t watch this? What a great meet-cute for a rom-com, no? We meet at this meeting. She’s played by Anne Hathaway. I like to imagine I’ve booked the role of myself, but if we’re being honest, it’s Jesse Eisenberg or skinny Jonah Hill. And like, we meet at this meeting. And we start dating, and I have to hide the fact that I’m Jewish. And eventually, we start sleeping together, and she’s like, “Why are you circumcised?” And I’m like, “Don’t worry about it.” And, like, things are going really amazing, and I get down on one knee towards the end of the film at the top of the Empire State Building, in the rain, it’s a rom-com. And as I open up my ring box to propose, I lock eyes with my TALMA teacher from fifth grade, and I’m like, “Rabbi Klammer?” And he’s like, “David Yosef Shimon Edelman?” And she’s like… And she runs away. But her best friend, Rebel Wilson, is like, “Girl, you gotta go back to him. He is a good man.” And so we reunite, and we kiss, and the last scene of the movie, we’re married in my parents’ synagogue, right? Like that’s how that would go. You know, on Broadway, I’ve had to explain that to– The stomp to people. So, like, if you guys don’t know, when Jews get married, they wrap a glass up in a napkin and then they crush the glass because the glass represents… happiness. So, you’re just like, bam. Here’s the problem with my rom-com. I date very assertive women. I always have. So, what would really happen is, we’d meet at this meeting, we’d start dating, and then three weeks later… …I would be a Nazi. I’d be standing on my parents’ front lawn in Brookline, Massachusetts, holding a brick, and she’d be like, “Do it.” And I’m like… “Hi, Eema.” “Hi, Mom, this is Chelsea. This is Matt– Sorry, this is Cortez.” There’s so much complaining in this room. That’s the first thing that– There’s so much kvetching in this room. This is around the time they were taking down Confederate statues. Remember that? They’re very upset about that. They talked a lot about how White history is being erased. They’re taking down statues of White people. They’re pulling White people out of textbooks. Someone over here says, “They don’t even teach about White men in public schools anymore.”\\nAnd everyone’s like, “Mm-hmm.” “Mm-hmm.” And White people aren’t just being replaced in the classroom. It’s happening in real life. It’s happening in real life in their own country, in their own country, it’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And what’s enabling this replacement? What’s enabling, as the guy next to me says, “The slow-moving genocide against Whites in America”? It’s this myth. It’s this myth of White privilege. And this myth drives so much of the stuff they hate. It drives diversity hiring initiatives. It drives a popular culture they despise! Despise. And it drives reverse racism, which is when people are racist against White people just because they’re White. And then someone over here says, “It’s the biggest problem in the country today, and no one is brave enough to talk about it.”\\nAnd everyone’s like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” And I can give you two guesses… …at who they blame for this kind of thing. And you might not need your second guess. Because running through this meeting is this thick vein of antisemitism, but I’ve never seen this kind of antisemitism before. It’s almost exhilarating. It’s like thick, Technicolor, weapons-grade, conspiracy-theory level anti– Like, at some point, this guy two seats away from me, he just went, “Jews are sneaky and they’re everywhere!”\\nAnd I was like… “Seems like the wrong time to argue with this guy actually.” “That’s a disgrace.” “That’s a disgrace.” I see myself very much as a Jew. Obviously. But I see myself more than anything else as a Jew. Like when I wake up in the morning, my first thought is like, “Jew waking up.” And not just Jewish religious, observant, thoughtful about what it means in my life. If I was very secular, I’d be a completely different human being. Complete– If I was very secular in a fun, liberal city like New York or San Francisco, I think I’d consider myself bisexual. But because I was raised religious in a place like Boston, I consider myself straight with a couple of secrets. And I remember the first time I was aware of being Jewish. I should have been aware, like, eight days in.\\nBut the first time I was aware… The first time I was aware, I was, like, five years old. I’m at a Chuck E. Cheese at a children’s birthday party in Natick, Massachusetts. And I reached for a slice of pizza that had some sausage on it or pepperoni, something not kosher. And my grandfather was there, and he saw me reaching, and he kicked my hand. Kicked. And he said, “You can’t have that, David. We’re Jewish.” And I said, “What does that mean?” And with a totally straight face, he just went, “It means you’ll never be happy.” And I said, “Be’emet?” which means, “For real?” And he went, “Oh, yeah.” And I said, “Why?” And he said, “It means you’ll never be happy with the way things are. And you’ll always question things. And even when things are pretty good, they won’t seem that good to you.” And I said, “Papa, I don’t wanna be Jewish!” And then my grandfather laughed at me. And he just went… “Sweetie, that’s the most Jewish thing there is.” And it blows my mind when I meet non-Jews, and they say things to me like, “Oh, well, I get it ’cause I used to be a Christian, so.” “Sorry, what?” “Well, I was raised Christian, but a couple years ago, I decided I was nothing, so.”\\nNo– I understand that intellectually. I respect that, of course. But that is not how it works in Judaism. You can’t leave when you feel like it. Judaism is the Hotel California of religions. It is a mailing list, you can never “unsubscribe” from. And I worry that I’m not Jewish enough. I worry that. I– Which is crazy, ’cause to my comedy friends, I’m the most Jewish person they’ve ever met. I’m a beard away from their conception of rabbi. And to my family, I’m Lady Gaga. I called my father once. My father is this lovely, thoughtful professor at Harvard Medical School, religious, wears a yarmulke, a kippah. Every single day of his life. If something goes well, he says, “Baruch Hashem.” “Thank God.” And I called him, I said, “Dad, Abba, I worry that the life that I lead isn’t Jewish enough.” And he said, “Alex, I understand that concern.” And I said, “Do you ever worry about that?” And he said, “Of course. I worry every day that the life that you lead isn’t Jewish enough.” And I am so tough on other Jews. I am relentless with other Jews. It’s my least favorite thing about myself. Like… Like, I was at a friend’s house. I’m meeting my friend’s baby. So many of my friends are having babies or adopting. I’m thinking a lot about adoption, but I’m 34. And I think for adoption, that’s right on the line, age-wise. Right? Like, I think that’s too old. I don’t think anyone is gonna take me at this point.\\nBut like— I’m holding… I’m holding this baby, and the baby starts to cry. Oh, baby’s name is Yasi. My friend’s name is Mati. His wife’s name is Rahel.\\nThese are normal names where I’m from. They are. Those are normal names. And I’m holding the baby, and he starts to cry, which is fine. He’s a baby. But Rahel, who I don’t think’s ever really liked me, just went, “Huh.” “Looks like he’s not a fan of yours, is he?” And I said, “It’s fine. He’s a baby.” And she said, “He actually has a really good sense for men.” And I said, “He doesn’t have a good sense for anything. He doesn’t even know he’s alive yet.” And apparently, never say this to a new mother. I said, “He’s just like a brisket with eyes right now.” And she said, “He’s very intuitive.” And I said, “He’s not. He shits himself.” And the husband, who I’ve known forever, he’s seen enough and he just went, “Whoa! Whoa–” Still calls me David. That’s how long I’ve known this guy. I’ve known this guy forever. And he went, “Whoa! Sorry, David, we’re a little uptight– We are. We’re a little uptight, ’cause people have been judging us for the way that we’re raising the baby.” And I said, “What do you mean?” And he said, “Well, we’ve decide– We’ve decided that we’re not gonna vaccinate until we know a bit more.” And I was like, “Against COVID, you don’t need to. He’s an infant.” He’s like, “Not against COVID, against like mumps and measles and the other stuff.”\\nAnd I was like, “Oh!” “Oh, well, first of all, here’s your disease baby back.” “Second of all, what are you talking about?” And he said, “Well, we’ve read that the vaccines can cause autism.” And I said, “That is not true.” And Rahel went, “What do you know about autism?” And I was like, “First of all, I’ve been tested 11 times.” “You think you get like this without people asking a couple of questions?” I am so neurodivergent. I saw so many child psychiatrists growing up in the Greater Boston area, the last one was free. And I just have, like, one memory. I’m sitting on this brown couch in this doctor’s office, and my mom is outside in the waiting room talking to the doctor. And I just remember hearing her go, “What do you mean, ‘He’s fine?'” And I was like, “Yeah, vaccines don’t cause autism.” “Mati, you know that.” And like, it ends the conversation. He just went, “Well… it’s our opinion, isn’t it? We’re his parents. It’s our opinion.” And I don’t know that I would do this with someone who wasn’t Jewish, but I just went, “Oh, and you guys are embarrassed.” “Right, you’re mortified, ’cause it’s such a low-information opinion.” “‘Cause there’s no basis in science, and it’s so bad for the child, so you probably don’t tell people.” “Something so ill-informed.” And he said, “Excuse me, we’re his parents. You don’t have children. You’ve never had to make this choice. You’re judging us for our opinion?” And I was like, “That’s how we judge people!” “Their opinions and their actions, and the content of their character. It used to be skin color, but someone had a dream.” And he said to me, in Hebrew, in Hebrew, “David, you can’t judge us. Only God, only Hashem can judge.”\\nAnd that worked with me. No, but that calmed me down immediately, ’cause it reminded me how I know this guy. I know this guy ’cause we went to a yeshiva together, which is a Hebrew day school. And in a yeshiva, you study Torah every morning from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., because “yeshiva” is a Hebrew word that means “miserable.” In a yeshiva, when they teach you about God, they teach you that he acts through you. If you are kind, that is God showing kindness. If you’re empathetic, that is Hashem manifesting empathy. In Hebrew, the word is “kli.” It means “vessel.” You are a vessel for God’s action. And so he said to me, “David, you can’t judge us. Only God can judge us. Alex can’t judge us. Only Hashem. Only Hashem can judge.” I calmed myself down, and I remembered that we have this common language and lineage, and that on paper, we’re basically the same person. And I explained to him that it’s possible that God was judging him, but that I was the vessel through which he had chosen to judge him. And we have not been invited back to that house. But it’s worth asking why this guy and his wife, who I have everything in common with, that’s who I go toe-to-toe with in their own living room, I show them so little understanding. In this living room in Queens, where I have so little in common with anyone, I sat there listening to them for an hour. All right. Guys, I sat in a conversation without talking one time… …for an hour, which for me… unprecedented. I couldn’t even nod. Everybody else was like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” I had to nod at things out of context. Like at some point someone was like, “What it means to be a man in the workplace is changing.” And I was like… “That’s absolutely– Yeah, there’s a reckoning going on. I agree with that. It’s way better now. You can’t just, like, throw your interns out the windows. Mm-hmm.” And someone’s like, “Billionaires and corporations control our elections.” And I was like, “I’d like to see meaningful campaign finance reform in the United States.” “Such a progressive value, isn’t it? Yeah, that’s good.” And finally, I get a chance to talk. There’s this guy two seats away from Chelsea, and his name is Witt. And if such a thing can be said, he’s my favorite. You know how some people can be in their early thirties, but they have a vibe of teenager? That’s Witt. He’s a little blithe and slumpy. And, at some point, he’s like, “You know what’s really hard for us now? It’s really hard for us to reach new people on social media.” And I said, “Do you know why that is?” And Chelsea went, “Alex, do you know something about social media?” And I said, “Chelsea, I know a lot about social media.” And I started explaining this thing called the meaningful content algorithm. This is so interesting. All right, it used to be in the early days of social media, when you logged in, you’d see stuff chronologically. Remember that? You’d see things based on when they were posted. But now when you log in, you don’t see that anymore. You see what the algorithm thinks you’ll enjoy most first. That’s because of this thing called the meaningful content algorithm. And it’s Balkanized us into these social media echo chambers, which has made it so hard for new ideas, or in this, like, one specific instance, the oldest ideas in the world to reach new people. And so I start explaining the algorithm, I start explaining social media echo chambers, I start explaining Cambridge Analytica, the company that’s, like, best at this, and everybody’s listening to me. And, at some point, I looked around the circle, and people have got their arms crossed, and they’re nodding at each other, and they’re nodding at me. And I thought to myself all at once, “Oh, I’m positively contributing to this meeting of White nationalists.” I came as an observer. I’m gonna leave as, like, the “youth outreach officer” or something. But there was a moment… where I actually started to feel very badly for these people. I don’t want to be gratuitous, but these are not life’s winners. Hashem has not given with both hands to anyone in this room. They are not the brightest. They are not the wealthiest. They are very badly informed. And most importantly… …these guys are racists in New York City! They’re racists in Queens, the most diverse borough and the most– Guys, it’s Queens. In Queens, you can’t even get 17 Nazis together without a Jew being sat right there in the middle of you. This isn’t Arkan-ssippi. Are you kidding me? We’re two blocks away from Little Ethiopia. Things are going not well for these people. And at some point, I had a thought, which was so, like… I had a thought that was so self-aggrandizing, it took me two years to tell anyone about it. But at some point, I looked around the circle, and I thought to myself, “Wow.” “Look at me empathizing.” “Look at me feeling bad for these people when they’re so horrible, but I’m such a good boy.” “Am I the hero that we need in these difficult and divided times?” And then I thought, “Do I have a duty as a Jew… to hear these people, ’cause there’s actually something to that?” If you raise Jewish children correctly, empathy is the default. Empathy is the true north for every Jewish value. And all of the best Jewish moments of my life are moments where those values showed up in places you would never look for them. Like, once when I was a kid, my family had Christmas. This is totally true. My mom had this friend named Kate. And over the course of a calendar year, Kate lost her last parent and her last sibling. She had nowhere to go for the holiday. My mom said, “Kate, why don’t you come to our house? We’ll do Christmas.” That’s the kind of person my mom is.\\nMy father… did not want that. Mom is a Jew from Cincinnati. She’s a Midwestern Jew.\\nIt’s a slightly gentler existence. My father grew up Jewish in Boston like me, but in a time when it was so hard to be Jewish there, which is between the years 1500 and 1991. And he said, “Cheryl, I will not have Christmas in a Jewish home.” And my mom was like, “Elazar, we’re having Christmas.” And he’s like, “Over my dead body are we having Christmas.” So they compromised and we had Christmas.\\nSo… Yeah, obviously. Obviously AJ and I come downstairs one day. My parents are sitting in the living room. I don’t know if any of you grew up in a home like this. We were never allowed in our living room. Never. The living room is for guests and tragedies. Those are the only times. And every piece of furniture is covered in plastic, in case the real owners of the house show up one day. We come downstairs, no guests. AJ and I look at each other like, “Oh, no. Bubbe died again,” and we sit down… …on the couch. And my mom just said, “Boys… this year… we’re having Christmas.” And AJ and I were so young and insulated. We looked at each other and we looked at my dad and I just went, “Okay. What’s Christmas?” And my father said, “It’s like Hanukkah.” And my mom undermined him immediately and went, “Yeah, but maybe even a little bit more fun.” Hanukkah sucks, by the way. Hanukkah– I appreciate the politically correct world that everybody lives in where we all pretend that all the holidays are equal. They are not equal. Every– Hanukkah’s very much the Diet Coke to Christmas’ black tar heroin. There is no comparison. No– Go into a supermarket come December. Christmas is everywhere. Hanukkah’s one little nub at the end of the shampoo aisle, there’s Passover matzah in there for some reason. And non-Jews are gorgeous ’cause they’re always like, “Well, you’re so lucky. You get eight days of gifts.” I have never met a single Jew who got eight days of decent gifts. Here’s how it works. You get one gift over the course of the– Like if you’re getting a bike, you get, like, a pedal on the first day, handlebars on the second, then the wheel.\\nIt is absolute bullshit. Anyway, we do Christmas and oh, my God, do we do Christmas. We do the lights. We do the Christmas dinner. My… My mom put up stockings above the fireplace with our names on them in Hebrew and we… …we went whole hog. No hog. Kosher, Christmas. But we decked these halls. Deck! And Kate comes into our house. And Kate… …White. Princess Diana haircut, chunky gold earrings, Hermès scarf, shocking blue pantsuit. White. But she walks into our house like a little kid. Just like… And she starts to cry immediately. And my mom said, “Boys, whatever she wants to do, we’re gonna do.” And we did all this deep cuts Christmas stuff. We strung popcorn together on a string. We ate our way through an entire chocolate Advent calendar in, like, 25 minutes. And we watched Christmas movies. Please try to imagine being a young Jew and you’ve never heard of Christmas, and then on the day you find out about it, you watch, like, seven Christmas movies in a row. AJ and I are like, “Oh, so this holiday’s a huge deal, huh?” And the one that sticks out is the Peanuts Christmas special. Snoopy, Charlie Brown, best thing we’ve ever seen. AJ and I are like vibrating an inch from the TV. AJ’s like, “The meaning of Christmas, Snoopy.” And I’m like, “The spirit of Christmas, Charlie Brown.” My dad’s in the corner, like, praying for lightning.\\nLike… And at some point, a character on the screen just went, “Linus, we need to put out cookies for Santa Claus, don’t we?” And AJ and I look at each other. And we look at my dad, and I just went, “Abba… who’s Santa Claus?” And my father says this didn’t happen. And it is the single clearest memory from my childhood. My father rarely cursed in front of us and maybe he thought we couldn’t hear him, but he looked at my mom and he just went, “Cheryl… Jesus fucking Christ.” And my mom said, “Elazar.” And he said, “Come on.” And she went, “Just do it.” This is a direct quote. This is a direct quote from, like… …twenty-five years ago. My father walked up to us and he said… “Santa Claus, boys… he is a fat man.” “But it’s a good fat.”\\n“But it’s a good–” You know, like, Santa’s an avocado or something. “But it’s a good fat. And he comes down non-Jewish chimneys in the middle of the night and he gives gifts to young Christians.” And AJ and I are like… And AJ just said, “And he’s coming here?” My father’s like, “Sure. I guess he’s coming here.” We put out cookies for Santa Claus. We’re very skeptical, obviously. We go upstairs. We go to bed. We come downstairs the next morning. The cookies are gone. Guys, they’re gone. And AJ and I see that and we lose consciousness immediately. We, like, black out, and I know it’s happened, ’cause there’s home video, and on the home video, we’re going crazy. We’re like, “Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He was here! He was here! Eema, he was here! Dad, he was here!” And, at some point, AJ’s standing on the couch and he looked at me and he just went, “Santa came!” And I went, “Baruch Hashem!” And we ran out to the garage. Why? Because this is the one concession my father got from my mom. He’s like, “Cheryl, I will not have a Christmas tree in a Jewish home.” And my mother was like, “I can respect that, Elazar. We’ll put it in the garage.” And there are two photos of this. Weird photos. We’re wearing pajamas ’cause we’re children, but we’re wearing jackets ’cause we’re in a Boston garage in December, and we’re wearing yarmulkes ’cause we’re Jews. But we’re standing in front of a fully-decorated Christmas tree with a teddy bear wearing his own yarmulke on top of it. And we’ve got headphones on. Why? Because this is how long ago it was. We got cassette tape Walkmen. Remember the square dealies? We were thrilled. That was Santa’s gift. Kate had gotten us her own gift. Kate had pulled my parents aside the night before and she was like, “Don’t worry, Cheryl.” “Don’t worry, Elaser.” “I got your boys Jewish gifts.” My father was like, “Oh!” “Okay, um, Kate, when you say Jewish gifts, what do you mean?” And Kate’s like, “I got them gifts from the Torah.” This was Kate’s gift from the Torah. To put in our cassette tape Walkmen, Kate got us, on cassette, the cast recording of Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat… …where the role of Joseph was sung by– Anybody know? Donny Osmond.\\nDonny Osmond, thank you. Donny Osmond. Two photos. Weird photos. Pajamas, jackets, yarmulkes, Christmas, teddy bear, yarmulke, headphones, and on the headphones, an Old Testament story from the Torah adapted into a musical by a British aristocrat where the lead role, sung by a Mormon.\\nIt’s very interfaith. And we go to school that day because yeshiva, Hebrew day school, not canceled for Christmas. And we come home that night and my father gets a phone call. It’s exactly what you think. And the first thing the principal says to him is, “Professor Edelman, your sons have a lying problem.” My father said, “What did they do?” And the principal said, “Well, the teacher tried to explain to the children the very delicate topic of Christmas and Alex raised his hand and just went… ‘We had Christmas.'” And the teacher’s like, “You didn’t have Christmas.” And I was like, “Hmm, pretty sure we had Christmas.” “Lights, stockings, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, meaning of Christmas, spirit of Christmas. Pretty sure we had Christmas.” And the teacher’s like, “You didn’t have Christmas. You had Hanukkah three weeks ago, or four months from now, depending on the Jewish calendar year.”\\nAnyway… …non-Jews believe in this guy called Santa Claus. And in my mind’s eye, I see AJ raising his hand and saying, “We had Santa Claus.” And I’m wrong. The teacher came to the show. I’m wrong about two things. First of all, apparently, AJ didn’t raise his hand. Apparently, AJ lifted two fingers, in the words of the teacher, like he was “ordering his second martini”. And AJ didn’t say, “We had Santa Claus.” Apparently, AJ just went… “We know Santa Claus.” And the teacher’s like, “You don’t know Santa Claus.” And AJ’s like, “Hmm. But we do know Santa Claus.” And the other kids are like, “Who’s Santa Claus?” And AJ’s like, “Oh! He’s amazing. He’s a fat man, but it’s a good kind of fat. And he comes down non-Jewish chimneys in middle of the night, and he gives gifts to young Christians. But… But, last night, because he’s friends with our dad… …he came to our house and he left this Walkman underneath the tree that my parents put in the garage, and he ate all of the cookies.” And the principal said, “Professor Edelman, is this true?” And, apparently, my father just went, “No.”\\n“It… It’s not entirely true.” And Rabbi Falk said, “What do you mean it’s not entirely true?” Then my father said, “Cheryl and I ate the cookies.” “Santa Claus didn’t come to our house.” And my mom says there was a significant pause on the other end of the phone, and then the principal said, “I’m aware Santa Claus didn’t come to your house.” “You had Christmas?” And my father explained. My father explained that this woman was bereft. She had nowhere to go. And he had reservations about it, but he let it happen because he thought it was such a valuable, teachable moment, right, where he could show his children that doing the thing centered in Jewish values, the good deed, may not always appear… conventionally Jewish. Principal says, “Professor Edelman, I understand where you’re coming from but you’re wrong, ’cause what you’ve actually done is you’ve introduced this holiday, that is foreign and corrosive, into your home and you’ve clearly confused your children and perhaps harmed them permanently… …when you’ve given them this holiday. Next year, are you gonna take it away? Will you keep celebrating? What are you gonna do? And more than anything else, this isn’t a good deed. It’s idol worship. It’s the most serious sin a Jew can commit. And you and your wife need to begin atoning for it right now.” And my father, to his credit, said, “Well, clearly, Rabbi, you don’t understand the meaning of Christmas,” and then he hung up the phone. And, look, I love that story. I think it reflects so well on my parents, but there’s such a good question at the center of it, very Jewish one, actually, which is, like, to what do our empathies extend? Is it unconditional? Does it matter who they are? Does it matter how they feel about us? Does it matter why we’re empath– Does it matter why we’re empathizing? ‘Cause, for a while, I was empathizing. In this room, these people feel powerless, they feel voiceless, even if they are 1,000 percent wrong! Those are universal struggles. It’s hard to hate people up close. But once I realized I was empathizing, I was like, “Look at me.” By the way, not just empathizing.\\nConnecting. Once I started talking, I was in the flow of conversation so effortlessly, I thought to myself, “I’m gonna be a grand wizard in like two weeks at this rate.” I’m getting my hood tonight. Like, it’s happening. I keep making eye contact with Chelsea. That’s going amazing. But like— But now my fantasy’s not just Chelsea anymore. Now, it sort of flowered out to the rest of the room. Like, obviously, everybody here’s gonna be a table at the wedding, but like besides that, I’m– No. I’m gonna fix these people. Guys, me. I’m gonna fix them. By the time this meeting starts to wind down, my “good guy” fantasies are like a runaway train. I have spoken more than two-thirds of the people in this room. I am in. They like me. And there’s this guy sitting almost directly across from me, right where the circle gaps, and he’s sort of running the meeting. And, at some point, he was like, “All right, guys. We’re gonna take a break. Anyone who wants to get a pastry, can get a pastry. When we come back, we’ll talk next steps.” And I’m nodding at this point. I’m like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Next steps.” And Cortez, whose eyes have very rarely left my area, just went, “Hold on one– Brian, excuse me. Hold on one second.” And he said, “Alex?” And I said, “Mm-hmm.” And he said, “Where are you from?” And I said… “I’m from Boston.” And he said, “Cool. How long have you lived in New York City?” And I said, “Oh, I’ve been here about nine years.” And he went, “Great. What’s the ethnic origin of your grandparents?” And there was a little voice in the back of my head that just went, “Wow, that third question was so different from the first two questions.” And I was like, “Well, my father’s family is from Poland but my mother’s family… is also from Poland, actually.” And the guy starts peppering me with questions, one after the– He asks me where in New York City I live. He asks me if I live alone. He asks me how much money I make in a year. And, at some point, I got a little offended. And I was just like, “This guy’s got a problem. He’s obsessed with me. Everyone else in this room, they like me. It’s so weird that they’re not stopping him. It’s weird that he can read that.” And he’s like, “Where did you go to college?” And I was like, “I went to New York University.” He said, “What did you study?” And I said, “English Literature.” He said, “Where did you go to high school?” And I said, “I went to a school in Boston called Maimonides.” And he went, “Maimonides?” And I said, “It’s a yeshiva.” Oh! And halfway around the circle, this lady just went, “Oh, boy.” And Witt went, “What’s a yeshiva?” And I said, “It’s like a Hebrew day school.” And Chelsea, looking for any sort of out at this point I assume, just went, “Your parents made you go to a Hebrew day school?” And I said, “Kind of.” And she said, “Why?” And jigsaw lady, of course, not looking at me, of course, just went, “Chelsea!” “So very clearly a Jew.” And because it wasn’t that big a deal, I just went… “I mean, yeah.” “Yeah, I’m… I’m Jewish.” You know… people say that political correctness… is a big part of our culture, but maybe it’s great, because I think political correctness is the reason that after I said I was Jewish, there was a split second where everyone in the circle kind of looked at each other with a real energy of like… “Are we cool with that now?” “Did I miss an email or something?” “I don’t wanna be rude, but isn’t that, like, one of our big things?” And then one person starts to talk, and then another, and then… and then I realized I may have misread how welcome I am. And people are yelling, but no one’s yelling at me. They’re yelling at the guy running the meeting, and I felt a little bad for him. I was like, “They’re not gonna get to the next steps for a while, probably.”\\nAnd Cortez, this guy’s out of his seat like he’s won a basketball game. He’s like, “I told you. I fucking– So obvious. Look at him.” And I look at Chelsea. And as soon as I do, I regret it. She has such an expression on her face. She looks so aggrieved. She has an expression like a shattered and re-glued plate. She looks so upset. And I find it so hard to look at her after that. And this guy running the meeting calms everybody down, no small feat. He’s like, “Okay. Okay. No, I didn’t know.” And he said, “Alex?” And I said, “Mm-hmm.” And he said, “Why are you here?” Which, in retrospect, is an excellent question. And this is my favorite detail from the whole meeting. This is my favorite detail from the whole night. He said, “Why are you here?” And I said, “Oh, I saw this tweet that said if you have questions about your Whiteness, then come–” Before I can finish, Witt, almost brightly, just went, “Oh! That’s my tweet.” “Oh! That’s my tweet,” with a real energy of like, “See? We are reaching some new people on social media.” And even then, I was like, “Yeah, bud, I saw your tweet. And as a White man, I actually–” And I don’t get to finish that sentence. Everyone starts yelling except for– “No. You’re not White. You’re Jewish. You’re Semitic. It’s different.” Someone over here went, “He’s not even a real Jew.” And I was like, “Dad?” And he said, “He’s an impostor from the Khazars.” And I said, “Oh, I– Okay. Well, I don’t know where that is, but I am Jewish and I am White.” And everyone says, “You’re not.” And I thought this would help me. I really did. I went, “Guys. Guys, I know it’s complicated given… …given that Whiteness is largely a social construct… …but I actually benefit an enormous amount from White privilege.” And everyone’s like… “No. No. Are you kidding? Haven’t you been listening? White privilege isn’t real. White privilege is bullshit.” Someone over here just went, “You have Jewish privilege. It’s different.” I was like, “That’s so interesting. I never thought about that before. But actually, I benefit a great deal from my Whiteness.” And Cortez is incensed. He’s out of his seat. He’s like, “It doesn’t exist.” And I said, “Come on, man.” And he went, “Really.” And I said, “I benefit from it.” He went, “When was the last time you got something for being White?” And I said, “Matt, I got a free muffin for it like an hour ago.” I… I don’t wanna spoil the ending of this for you… …but Chelsea and I, we’re not gonna work out. Although it’d be so cool if I could say, “And here she is.” “Come on out, sweetie!” And she’s like, “Ah!” I actually started dating someone. I actually started dating someone a couple months after this. And when I told her about this night, the first thing she said to me, she said, “Just so you know, this is the epitome of White privilege.” And I said, “What do you mean?” And she said, “Nothing says White privilege more than a Jew walking into a meeting of racists and thinking, ‘This’ll probably be fine.'” “Things usually work out pretty good for me, honestly.” “Oh, look. Muffins. Those are for me?” I’ll be out there afterwards, by the way, if anyone wants to ask a question. I answer every question. But obviously, if you’re watching at home and you have a question, I’m obscenely easy to reach on social media. Even if you hated the show, tweet at me. There’s a list I can add you to, you know? And the two questions I get the most are, one, “Were you scared?” Not really. Here’s the thing. Nazis, hmm, far less intimidating than the way that my grandfather described them. Also, they’re not Nazis. But– I hate to clarify a joke, but being a Nazi is actually such a specific thing from an extremely specific moment in history. These guys wish they were Nazis. Like, you ever see kids in the park, and they’re hitting each other with tinfoil swords? These guys are Nazis the way that those guys are the Knights of the Round Table. These are Nerf Nazis, you know? And the second question I get asked every single day is, “Why’d you go?” “Did you really go?” “My wife and I can’t believe you.” “Why’d you go?” Thought I could make it work. It’s my job. I make it work. I get on stage every night, and I am pandering and solicitous. And I hope that it’s enough to make people enjoy the show or tell a friend. Please tell a friend. And it’s gross. And there’s a huge part of me that genuinely walked into this room thinking like they’re just anti-Semites ’cause they haven’t met Alex yet. Haven’t met David Yosef Shimon Ben Elazar Reuven. This… not that different from the meeting. Not for me. I’m only telling you stuff I think you’d enjoy. Right, like, if you really knew me, you might not like me, right? There’d be a political opinion you couldn’t stand, or I’d be too something. I’d be too pretentious, or ambitious, or lazy, or too Jewish, or not Jewish enough. There’d be something. You know who I think about constantly? Robin Williams. A gift for connection no one else could– A gorilla! A gorilla was like, “Oh, my God, the talent is undeniable.”\\nA gorilla! If Robin Williams can make it work with a gorilla, I should be okay with 16 White people in Queens. Trying to acknowledge their humanity with this analogy, but I am aware that in this analogy, these guys are gorillas and I’m one of the greatest comics who’s ever lived. But if you think about it, who gets dehumanized? Right? ‘Cause for a second, I’m in. I’m White. Finally. Right? Childhood dream achieved. And then they find out that I’m Jewish… and the walls go up. But it doesn’t reflect amazing on me, ’cause I wanted them to like me. I was performing. I am always perform– I got kicked out of this meeting, and it bothers me… …on a craft level… …’cause that’s what happens. This guy calms everybody down and he’s like, “Okay. Okay. We’re gonna take that break and anyone who needs to leave can leave.” And even though I’m not amazing with social cues, I was like, “I bet he means me.” And this is the kind of dumb joke the whole show could have been. Everybody else… …gets up and they all move… to the far right corner of the room. And I’m getting my stuff. I look sad now. I look like I’ve lost Wimbledon or something.\\nI’m like, “Oh, God.” “Can’t believe they would do this to the good boy.” And Chelsea… Chelsea. Chelsea crosses this vast expanse of floor to me. And I felt so bad for her in that– I remember thinking, “Man, horrible time and place for you to discover that this is your type.” And she gets to me. She said… “You’re Jewish?” And I said… “Can you believe it?” And for the first time, it doesn’t work. And she went, “So you’re fully Semitic or partial? What’s going on.” And I said, “Both my parents are Jewish.” And she said, “That’s so interesting.” She’s very calm, actually. “That’s so interesting. You know why? Because this is a private residence.” And I said, “Well, I was invited.” And she said, “You were… You weren’t invited. You’re committing a crime right now. You’re trespassing. You can’t be here. This is just for us. Go!” So… So the next morning, call David Burstein… tell him what he missed. And he’s quiet all the way through. He just lets me talk. I talk for like 40 minutes. But when I got to this part of the story, he interrupted me. And pardon the language, but he was like, “And you looked at her and you said, ‘Fuck you, lady.’ And then you looked at everybody else in the room and you’re like, ‘Fuck every single one of you racist, bigoted, anti-Semitic assholes.'” And I was like… “Yeah.” “Of course I put a finger in her face and I’m like, ‘Screw you. And screw– Screw all your little Nazi budd–‘” But that’s not what happened. What really happened is, I got scared by the trespassing thing. And I quailed immediately, and I just went… “Okay.” And on the way out, this is so much worse, I looked at everybody else, and I just went, “Sorry, you guys!” And I left. I left. You know, I had a conversation with someone the day before this run on Broadway started and… and he said to me, “Would you go back?” “A thousand percent.” And he said, “Really?” I said, “Yeah. What, I’m supposed to lock myself in a room with people who agree with me?” “That’s how you wind up like this.” But I get his point, because whenever anyone is like, “Oh, the way to reach these people on the far right or the far left is to extend this hand of brotherhood and connection, and let them know that in the marketplace of ideas, they are welcome–” Like that’s a lovely notion. That’s how I feel. That’s a Jewish value. But some of them want us gone. And when I say us, I mean, us. Like even if you guys aren’t Jewish or a person of color, the fact that you bought a ticket to this show… …I feel bad for you guys. You guys are screwed. See you on the trains. They hate you so much. I’m glad I went. I really took something away with me. Not like a lesson or anything like that. I really took something away with me and it’s very small, but I think it’s significant. And I think it’s significant because it’s one piece from a 12,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\\n♪ (“SECTION 14 ” BY THE POLYPHONIC SPREE PLAYING) ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n♪ And I know there’s a lot Outside the window ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot For you and me ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It takes the sun To make the sidewalk ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It takes the moon To burn my feet ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It means a lot To take some time ♪\\n♪ I know it’s right You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n♪ You gotta be good You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot to show ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You’ve got the time to grow ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot to show ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You’ve got the time to grow ♪\\n♪ You got 2,000 places ♪\\n♪ Whoo! ♪\\n♪ And time will show the way ♪\\n♪ And love will shine today ♪\\n♪ And time will go away ♪\\n♪ So love can grow ♪\\n♪ (SONG CONCLUDES) ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAlex Edelman, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 thought on “Alex Edelman: Just for Us (2024) | Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCat Nygaard 10/05/2024 at 01:41  \\n\\n\\nLoved, Loved, Loved this show!!

Stripping away the primal elements typically associated with the act, Novak invites the audience into a cerebral discussion on the subject, humorously dissecting its semantics, cultural perceptions, and the juxtaposition of physical desire with intellectual analysis. Her performance, characterized by self-deprecation, sharp wit, and a refusal to conform to conventional comedic tactics, offers a fresh perspective on gender dynamics, sexual expectations, and the often-comical reality of embodying a “thinking, feeling, desiring body” in a society filled with contradictions. Through her insightful and comedic lens, Novak navigates the complexities of sexual identity and expression, making “Get on Your Knees” a thought-provoking reflection on the absurdity of human sexuality.\\n* * *\\n[“Like a Prayer” by Madonna playing]\\n[horn honking]\\n♪ Life is a mystery ♪\\n♪ Everyone must stand alone ♪\\n♪ I hear you call my name ♪\\n♪ And it feels like ♪\\n♪ Home ♪\\n[crowd cheers]\\n♪ When you call my name ♪\\n♪ It’s like a little prayer ♪\\n♪ I’m down on my knees ♪\\n♪ I wanna take you there ♪\\n♪ In the midnight hour ♪\\n♪ I can feel your power ♪\\n♪ Just like a prayer ♪\\n♪ You know I’ll take you there ♪\\nThank you. Despite… Despite your warm welcome, that journey was hell. [audience laughing] The journey from backstage to a microphone always is. It’s fraught. And it’s ’cause for me what it reminds me of, frankly, uh, is the journey, you know… [audience chuckling] …from someone’s face, down their torso… [audience laughing] …to their pelvis, to give them a blow job. ‘Cause the whole way there, both scenarios, everyone knows what you’re headed to do, but you’re not yet doing the thing, so there’s just this question hanging in the air the whole way of, “Can she do it?” I mean, “Will she do the thing we’re all here for well or badly?” And oh God, the uncertainty, the [exhales]… the tenuousness. I mean… [exhaling] Can you feel it? [audience laughing] I am gonna talk about the blow job quite a bit tonight. “To the point of tedium,” said one early critic.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI think I do it in a way that allows us all to maintain our dignity. Uh, if you’re here with a parent or a sibling, it will be okay. I’m very concerned with dignity. I’m someone that, for example, prefers to call “doggy style” “the Hound’s Way.” [audience laughing] I think the position deserves a term with some gravitas. I think it’s one of our more noble positions. I feel like any of these positions where you’re staring into the eyes of your lover, you know, as if to become one, there’s something immature there, I’m not impressed. [audience laughing] To me, the Hound’s Way, it represents a more mature kind of love, where two lovers can look towards the future together. [audience laughing] You know, it’s not… it’s not sad. It’s not sad that I’m not looking at him, that I’m not making eye contact with him. Because it’s more like… it’s more like we’re these two pioneers headed west. And I gotta keep my eye on that horizon ’cause these are… these are tough times.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckling] But I’m a strong woman. I know hubbin’s gotten from behind. I feel him bringing it up the caboose. I just gotta put my face into the wind and keep on keeping on through this good night ’cause our young nation depends on it. That sort of thing. [audience laughing] I do have a sort of poetic sensibility I like to warn people about at the top of the show because I know it can be trying at times. I can’t help myself. Yeah, I used to write poetry in college. Like many, I gave it up. I grew tired. I grew tired of being in a constant state of enchantment. [audience laughing] You know, just so many hours spent curled in windowsills, just the muscles cramping, the eyes drying out from all that wonderment, just… Every night seeing the moon as if for the first goddamn time. I just wanted to grow accustomed to the moon, you know? I wanted to take moonlight for granted, like other girls.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI hope you’ve taken your opportunity by now just to, you know, take in my physical form. Uh… That is your right, you know. [chuckles] I take the stage, you show up, you get to look, and fair enough. Fair enough. But it is a nightmare, it is a nightmare for an intellectual like myself. [audience laughing] Really to be incarnate at all, frankly. I mean, as a woman of ideas on some level, everything, everything from the chin down feels beneath me. I don’t know what else to say. “Limbs and torso, there she goes.” All a bit common. You know? The female form, this female form of mine, this sort of sack of sex potatoes, you know, this tits and ass that can’t leave home without, oh, an explanation for. “Why would you bring those out if you didn’t bring enough for the class?” [audience laughing] I can’t leave them at home. No taters for sale tonight. You know? No. No, I like to keep it moving on stage ’cause I know, I know how you people operate. Okay, okay, I stand still for too long, you see something you like, you take a mental snapshot. Who knows what you’ll do with it later? I… I much prefer… I prefer to keep things moving, keep ’em blurry. Thank you very much. Try to take a mental snapshot and it’s nothing but a gray blur. Simple self-preservation. No, I look forward to it. I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, through death, of course, as a ghost.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSpecifically. I look forward to being a ghost, think of myself as a future ghost, the body as training wheels I can’t wait to cast off and fly free. You know? Not too free, of course. In order to become a ghost, you gotta get stuck here, and I’ll do what it takes. You know? You know, manufacture some unfinished business, do what’s necessary. My meditation practice these days, it’s getting too strong, you know? It’s getting too consistent where spiritually I’m kind of in a place where I die I sort of instantly transcend, instantly dissolve into the one. And that’s not what I want. I want to linger. Do you see, I wanna linger as me. I want to haunt a house, and I know perhaps that’s a quaint dream, you know, unoriginal, but it’s mine, nonetheless. I mean, imagine. To night after night, to night after night just watch television behind someone watching television. [audience laughing] Just giving yourself over to their programming choices. I mean, that… that would be a meditation in its own right, the surrender required there, you know. I just, uh… I wanna be a ghost, but if I make it as a ghost, I wanna be a strong ghost, a robust ghost, you know. No blurring away at the edges for me. I wanna have fully articulating fingertips. I want to be 75% opacity at minimum. [audience laughing] I’d say 85 max. I want you to know I’m a ghost.\\nOtherwise, what’s the point?\\n[audience laughing] Primarily you just wanna make sure you don’t end up as one of these orb figures, uh, the orb characters, they’re kinda the embarrassment of the ghost community, depending on who you talk to. [chuckles] I don’t know if you guys watch quite as much nonfiction, paranormal programming inside the home as I do. I watch quite a bit. I’m a lifelong learner. [audience laughing] But if you don’t know… if you don’t know the orbs, those are those, uh, small, transparent circles of light that occasionally appear in a photograph and someone’ll say, “Oh, great-grandmother did come to the wedding.” It’s nice. It’s really nice stuff. [audience chuckling] But people are so rude about orbs. I mean, if you try to talk about an orb with anything resembling seriousness, they come for you. They simply come for you, you know? And it’s just so rude. I mean, because imagine if you were the great-grandmother and you did it, you know? You managed to gather your strength in the afterlife and appear for your family as anything at all. I mean, a little circle, that’s pretty good. I mean, have any of you ever made yourselves appear as anything at all using your consciousness alone?\\nI certainly haven’t.\\n[audience laughing] One of the basic shapes. And then to be dismissed, just summarily dismissed by some surely unrigorous skeptic of a great-grandson. [laughs] I will not have that happen to me. No, everyone will know who’s present. It’ll be, “Hi, Johnny, it’s me.” You know? But that’s not the point. That’s not the point. Well, you know, if you insist on such a thing and you would, wouldn’t you? No, the point is I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, uh, its needs, its wants, you know, all hideousities to me, uh… I am what many would historically call a heterosexual woman, and no, I’m not proud. [audience laughing] It’s a patent humiliation in this day and age. I know what you’re thinking. Does she even read? [audience laughing] And I do, I do, and yet, you know, how can I when I’m just a… a girl with a ponytail just lusting after the common shaft? [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t believe it happened to me. I mean, just that simple cylinder, that… that familiar tube, that object of seemingly no nuance. The word I’m avoiding saying, of course, is “penis” and now I’ve said it.\\nAnd do I feel better? No, I don’t.\\n[audience laughing] I don’t love the word, few do, you know. A big part of me would probably rather say the word “cock” for you people. I think a lot of you’d rather hear it. The boyfriends sure did, you know? [audience laughing] Cock is a good word, it has a kind of dignity to it. You know, you gotta wind it up and kick it from the back of your mouth. “Co” but then “ck.” It lands. A “ck, ck.” It lands on the same damn consonant it started on, you know? Penis. Penis just sort of slips out the side of the mouth.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Penis.” “I’m sorry. Did you say something?” “Well, I’m not sure anymore.” “I thought a word and I felt something happen.” You know? People say, people say, “Well sure, I wouldn’t use the word penis sexually, it’s too clinical.” I don’t hear the voice of the clinician in that word. I don’t think penis is our most medical-sounding word. I mean [chuckling]… I think the problem for people… I think the problem for people with the word penis lies in its sort of tender emotionality. I don’t think the word penis is a problem for people ’cause it sounds accurate to what it is. Penis. Penis. [chuckles] It sounds like a soft heartbeat. Penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis. And I think that’s the problem. I think… I think… I think the problem lies in the syllables themselves too. I don’t think this is one of these Rose-by-any-other-name scenarios. No, “Pe-” is clearly a problem. Pe… Peener… Pee-pee. You know, it’s been mocked for ages and rightfully so. You know? But to me, the true… the true tender syllable of devastation, oh, it’s the “nis.” It’s the “nis.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI mean, can you believe that’s been there the whole time? “Nis.” “Nis.” And that’s why no one speaks of that syllable. That’s why… that’s why no one says, you know, “Show me that nis.” [audience laughing] Wait till you see this nis? Nis-nis? They won’t even make a joke. No, it’s too tender. It cannot be spoken. No, “cock” clearly, clearly… “cock…” Clearly “cock” is the sexy word. You know? But there’s an issue. There’s a problem with the word “cock” for me. In a way, it becomes unsexy. And the problem is that when I call the penis a cock, I’m not actually calling it like I see it. [audience laughing] I’m kind of telling it what I think it wants to hear. [audience laughing] I’m worrying about the feelings of the penis. I’m coddling the little ego of the penis. I’m humoring the penis. Like, when I call the penis a cock, I don’t throw it away. It’s not cock, it’s cock. “Who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” [audience laughing] When I call a penis a cock, I’m humoring it. Like I might humor my little nephew, for example, or a friend’s son, you know? [laughs] You know, one of these guys, these over and down guys. These little… the person I love and the little guy below them. Like… when I call the penis a cock, I treat it like I treat my little nephew. He’ll come running into the kitchen where the adults are talking wearing a little monster mask or something, and we… we see him and it’s sort of like, “Oh, sorry, sorry… Ah!” and then right back to talking. [audience laughing] ‘Cause he didn’t scare us.\\nHe was unsuccessful in his little ruse.\\n[audience laughing] And you hear his feet… you know, he’s coming around again. You give him it even faster the second time. “Ah!” Right back to it. No showmanship… [laughs] …and yet he’s been rewarded. Now… Do you love your nephew? Of course. But do you respect him? [audience laughing] I don’t think you do. No, no, true respect… true respect for the nephew isn’t “Ah!” Right? No, true respect for the nephew is “What? No, you didn’t scare me, but I believe you can.” “So… so try again.” And to me, it’s the same with the penis. True respect for the penis, you know, it’s not, “Oh, who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” Right? True respect for the penis is, “Penis.”\\n[moaning]\\n[audience laughing] If the penis is enough, then the word “penis” should suffice, you know? If the penis has a chance at being sexy, then the word penis should have a chance at being sexy. And in theory… in theory, it’s enough, you know? You know? In theory, it suffices. I mean, arguably, I’m a fan in the sense that I show up for it time and again with a regularity you can count on. I’m a sort of church mouse to the wafer crumb on Monday morning. There’s me. Sniffing about, hoping for a taste of the divine. So if the penis isn’t the fucking cock, that I feel like I have to act like it is in its presence, but I’m still showing up for it. I’m still a fan. Then what am I showing up for? What is the penis to me? What is its nature?\\n[exhales]\\n[audience chuckling] Well, it’s tender.\\nIt’s responsive. You know, it’s like…\\n[audience laughing] It springs up under certain conditions. That’s why I think it has the soul of an artist, you know. [audience laughing] It sees something that intrigues it and it sort of… [audience laughing] It fills with inspiration. And it is a filling to me. It is a filling to me much more than it is a… [clicking] …erection. I think erection’s a little architectural for what’s happening there. I don’t think anyone should go in that building, I don’t think it’s safe. It’s not up to code. [audience laughing] And unlike a building, it doesn’t… it doesn’t topple, it withers. It dies on the vine. [audience laughing] The penis… the penis, it blooms and it withers and it blooms again. This kind of eternal flower stretching towards that which nurtures it, you know, as if warmed by the sun. I mean, it’s moving. It’s a romantic figure, a boldly romantic figure. I mean, it gathers its strength, you know, to just stretch away from the rest of the body. Just goes for it in this plea, you know. It just… [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] “Love me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience applauding]\\n“Touch me, please.” “Touch me.” “Touching you, touching me.” “Quick, I only have a minute.” [audience laughing] Meanwhile, they try to tell you the vulva is the flower, you know. The vulva is the rose, the petals of the rose. You know, the vulva. I appreciate those comparisons, you know. They’re trying to say that the vulva is beautiful, and I agree, you know. But if someone gave me a bouquet of roses and one of them looked like my vulva, [audience laughing] I’d say, “I think someone stepped on one of the roses.” [audience laughing] It slipped from the bouquet, someone stepped on it. Then they tried to get rid of the evidence by kicking it into a crack in the wall. And it just won’t fully disappear inside there, will it? No. And why are the petals so thick? [audience laughing] No, the vulva… the vulva is beautiful, but it requires the kind of tilted gaze of a more poetic eye. Shall I step in? I mean, I’ll give it a shot. To me, the vulva… my vulva, perhaps, my vulva is beautiful in the way that a tattered flag is beautiful. [audience laughing] Its frayed edges telling a tale of how ideals met actualities. [audience laughing] To me, a vulva may be beautiful in the way a burger is beautiful. A burger with all its particular fixings, you know, wrapped up in crinkly, greasy, foiled paper, and then they cut… I love when they wrap it up and then they cut it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd then they go… [swishes] Then you see the layers, these different textures and they’re pressed together. And yeah, there’s a threat of a spill. Yeah, there’s a risk of a sudden disassembly. But it holds. It holds. The vulva is the burger that holds. [audience laughing and applauding] The penis is the flower. The penis is… I think the penis is a feminine icon, if I may be so bold. [audience laughing] At very least, it’s the most feminine thing on my boyfriend’s body. Like, if my boyfriend got out of the shower and said, “Quick, find the little woman on this man.” [audience laughing] It’d be an odd game, but I’d instantly have an answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not the shoulder.\\n[audience laughing] I’d go, “I see her. I see her. She’s right there. Susan.” The name Susan would come to me instantly. His penis is a Susan, but looking back… looking back, they were all Susans to me. They were Susans, they were Geraldines, they were Vanessas. Now, am I saying the penis is a little woman? Well, if you’re a certain kind of guy who really doesn’t like that idea, then yeah, that’s exactly what the fuck I’m saying. [audience laughing] But no, it’s more like… it’s more like the rude stereotypes of women. Those were good descriptions of the penis the whole time. Describe women unfairly, you’re probably describing the penis perfectly, you know. “Oh, they’re so sensitive. They’re always reacting to things.” “They’re needy, they nag you, they poke you in the night.” “Hello. Are you awake?” “I’m awake. I guess we’re both awake now.” [audience laughing] The penis is the sensitive. The penis is the nag. The penis is the drama queen. I mean, the ultimate drama queen. Just one minute, life of the party, and then the very next just flopped over and sulking on the fainting couch… [audience laughing] …that is the inner thigh, just waiting for someone to notice that frankly she’s upset. [audience laughing] Can’t be mad at her, she didn’t make a scene, she just stepped aside. Just left the… I’m not making a face. This is my face. [audience laughing]\\nThis is the face you married.\\n[audience laughing] The penis orgasm has kind of a hysterical quality to it… [audience laughing] …in the old sense. A proper turn-of-the-century Vienna Freud’s couch. A proper neurotic hysteric. The orgasm, a kind of sudden revelation, a hideous blurt, as a… “I killed father,” you know. [audience laughing] A little… a little bit of Abigail in the courthouse in The Crucible. And I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil! And now everyone… everyone’s gotta deal with it. A hint… a hint of my mother at a family gathering. Something comes to mind she thinks to say, realizes she shouldn’t. And then there’s a pushing it down, but the only relief for her is for her to just get it out. I see her coming my way, just… [muttering] “Are you sad you don’t have kids?” And it’s on me. [audience laughing] And she feels better, and fair enough. Fair enough. I get her a journal every year for Christmas, but I’m the journal. I’m the journal, and that’s okay. [audience laughing] That’s okay. But no, I feel like my orgasm… my orgasm doesn’t put it on you in that same way. I feel like my orgasm has more of a selfless, heroic, frankly militaristic quality to it. [audience laughing] I feel like my orgasm’s like, “You guys, run, run!” Like, “I’ll throw myself on the grenade and absorb the shock with my body.” [audience laughing] And then at its most, you know, explosive moments of pleasure, the vaginal vulva complex, it doesn’t explode. You know, it holds.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt holds. It embodies the masculine, Stoic, ideal. It just pulses. Doing isometric work, contained and strong. A Viking against a tree after the battle is over. Just pulsing to the rhythm of the battle drums fading away. No, the penis… the penis is clearly the more physically vulnerable of the crotchal items we come across. That’s why I’ve never understood why it doesn’t fully retract into the body… [audience laughing] …after it’s done doing any of the things it does. I always feel like, “Wait. Why can I still see you?” “You’re weak. You need to go home.” “It’s not safe for you out here in that form. You need to retreat.” “Please retreat. Retreat. Retreat.” Sometimes I like to think of it as a puppet at a puppet show. It comes out and does its bit, but after this puppet’s bit is over it doesn’t disappear behind the puppet theater. This puppet just dies over the front of the stage and hangs there lifeless and scaring the children while the show continues, and you’re going, “I feel like we’re not supposed to be able to see that character anymore.” And you’re just hoping someone will just reel it back in or the other puppets will incorporate its death into the narrative.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe penis’s vulnerability is something I’ve been aware of for some time. Really since, I don’t know, age 11 when I started reading these magazines with these articles, headlines on the cover, “How to please your man.” They broke the story every month and I’d flip to the article to see if there was anything new. And it always kind of came down to a list of instructions about how not to injure the tender penis. You know? I remember specifically they said, “Careful near the tip.” “It’s extremely sensitive.” “You… you can’t imagine a part of the body as sensitive as the tip of a penis.” It’s like, “Oh God.” It must be very sensitive then, and that’s the first thing I’m gonna run into on the penis, like in my approach. I have to land gingerly ’cause that’s the most sensitive part? Shouldn’t you bury that treasure somewhere deeper in the castle?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI go, “All right. Once I’m past the gauntlet of the sensitive tip, surely now I can relax.” “I mean, I’m on the shaft, right?” The shaft sounds strong, but no, they had a warning there. They said the underside of the shaft, the skin is thin and delicate. Shall I dab eye cream on it with my weakest finger? [audience laughing] Dab and tap. We’ll need dab and tap. And then the balls, the storied balls. Endless mythology of the balls, the way things can go wrong for them and it’ll be your fault. The blue balls legend, of course. Cross-culturally it can vary, but the essence is always the same, you know. If you’re the cause… if you’re the cause of an erection, well… well, you better answer for that erection you caused. ‘Cause clock’s ticking and pretty soon those balls down there, well, they could turn blue and I’m just… it’s never clear what happens after that.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAll that’s clear is that now you’re the witch. You’re the witch. [audience laughing] You’re the witch that turns little balls blue. It’s just never been… it’s never been a sexually-inspiring threat to me. The blue balls threat. You know that kinda, “Oh, somebody might want to do something soon like jerk me off or something, ’cause otherwise it’s really gonna hurt down there. Ooh.” It just turns you into this baby and me into your mama sexually where I have to look out for your potential medical emergency ’cause you know, it takes a village. [audience laughing] No, I… I think it’s the helplessness of blue balls that repulses me. That kinda… you know… the refusal to relieve oneself. If I have a very full bladder, I don’t stand around complaining, “Why isn’t anyone bonking me on the lower abdomen to get the urine out.” Right? I would excuse myself to relieve myself. But blue balls has this kind of… kind of… kind of… “No!” Right? “I don’t do it. No.” “No!” This kind of overtired… “No, I don’t do it… No, only Mama.” [audience laughing] “Only Mama burp my dick.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s a burping of the dick. [chuckles] If blue balls are real, then to relieve them is to burp them. And look, I occasionally overreach with my metaphors, you know, for the love of the game.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNot that one, that one’s perfect. [audience laughing] The teeth-shaming started young. The messages of “Oh, if you have your full set of teeth, don’t you go in a room where a penis is.”\\n“It’s not safe for that penis.”\\n[audience laughing] “Why would you put that penis at risk, you toothy monster?” What’s the idea, what’s the plan? Are you gonna try to give someone a toothy blow job? Is that the idea? The Toothy Blow Job, another tale from Grimms’, I guess. [audience laughing] And somehow kind of a big concept at my high school. The first time I understood this in a practical way that my teeth were a potential danger to the penis, I was 12. I was at my best friend’s house after school. So it was me, it was my best friend, you know, 12, her older sister, 16, and the older sister’s best friend, 16. So the relationship there, you know, is… is over, up, and over and I always feel like Over, Up, and Over is someone you can get real information from. [audience chuckling] I know everything Over knows. Everything Over knows came from Up. Over, Up, and Over? That’s a diagonal… that’s a diagonal wisdom. You go, “Thank God I’m here on this day. It didn’t have to go this way.” But I feel like she knew her role was to teach ’cause she said to us, kinda out of nowhere, “All right, so I guess I’ll show you girls now how to give a blow job because well, you’ll need to know eventually and ’cause I’m the blow job queen.” She just said it. [audience laughing] And she took a cucumber out of the fridge and she wrapped it in cellophane out of respect for dinner, which I appreciated… [audience laughing] …and she began to demonstrate on the cucumber. I don’t know who can learn from a demonstration in this life, I mean, any context, you know, they just do nothing for me. Watching the art teacher paint. It’s just, “Indeed, I… I see why you’re the teacher.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You’re very good.” “Shall we proceed to our canvases now so the humiliations can begin.” You know? She’s demonstrating on the cucumber and I’m more stuck on what she said. The “blow job queen” thing. Maybe even more the way she said it, ’cause she just said it, you know, she just let the words ring out in the air. She didn’t make a face to let us know that she knew that she was being a little funny or grandiose. No, she just said it and she launched into her demonstration with authority and I had questions, none of which I asked, to be clear. No, no, I mean the first one being, “According to whom?” But I’m not going to ask that, okay. I’m not going to ask that. I mean, to be clear, I didn’t even blink when she said blow job queen ’cause I think that’s one of the few courtesies we can offer nice people in this life. If they go for it and do the impossible? Say something about themselves with confidence?\\nJesus, let them have it. I mean, just…\\n[audience laughing] And don’t act like you’re letting them have it but like, also reveal that you’re not letting them have it… Sort of blinking up a storm. No, hold their gaze and let them have it. [audience laughing] It’s a nearly impossible act, you know? I’ll occasionally say my own name and then just go, “Did I get that right?” You know? [audience laughing] The confidence… the confidence required to say something like that. I mean, wow, you know. It felt like it was a proper self-appointment. And that impressed me and that bewildered me. I mean, I’ve always attempted in this life to err towards what feels to me like a sort of prudent self-doubt in favor of the potentially foolish self-confidence, you know. Self-confidence is a good idea, you know. Yeah, but there’s a risk there.\\nThere’s a risk there.\\n[audience laughing] I fear that if I’m confident, I may turn into what I think of as The Two Fools. [exhales] Okay, so if I like myself, might feel good. But what if I’m wrong about myself? [chuckling] What are me and myself? We’re just these two fools just congratulating each other. “Oh. Best in the biz.” “No one quite like us. We’re fantastic.” To me, it feels safe, you know, if I stand in the bathroom mirror, to look at that person in the mirror and insult the person in the mirror. Say, “You’re a fool.” That way, even if they are a fool, at least me, on this side of the mirror, I’m someone who can spot a fool. [audience laughing] And then I… I am not, in myself, two fools. I’m a fool and someone who’s well aware. You know? [audience laughing] I’m a fool and someone apologizing for them. And then… and then my duo has 50% dignity. Do you see? I get a guaran… If you split in two and hate yourself, you get a guarantee of 50% dignity, versus taking the gamble of zero versus 100. Do you see… do you see… do you see how… how the math of self-hatred is unimpeachable? [audience laughing and applauding] But the seemingly self-appointed blow job queen,\\nI’ll take it. [laughs]\\n[audience laughing] The seemingly self-appointed blow job queen said a couple things in her lesson that really stuck with me through the years. The first was just an offhand comment. She goes like this. “Oh, and you can play with the balls if you want,” and… and then never mention them again.” [audience laughing] “If you want.” “You can play with the balls if you want.” I mean, I’m… I’m still thinking about it. [audience laughing] Like you’re gonna be there, you’re gonna be dying to play with those balls, but you won’t know if you’re allowed, and she wanted to let us know that like the toys in the pediatrician’s office… No, please, those are literally there for you. [audience laughing] I mean, if she’d said tickle the balls, if she said tickle the balls, I’d know what to do. That’s a specific action, but to play with something… to play with something? I mean, that’s an intuitive, absent-minded sort of act. I mean, how does one bring an authentic spirit of play… [audience laughing] …to the balls? ‘Cause if there was a hint of cliché to my ball play, I could not live, do you understand? No! A whiff of contrivance. No, it is authentic or not at all for me in this life. That is a principal I’ve stood by since infancy. Really, really, I was one of the most authentic infants on that ward.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt was facade-ville in there, honestly. All these babies. “Oh, look at me, I’m a baby.” Not me. I was just living. [audience laughing] Authentic or not at all, the principle I’ve stood by for better or worse. [chuckling] I could give you endless examples… I could give you endless examples of me choosing authenticity when I feel others did not. I’ll give you one example from childhood, perhaps you’ll see yourself reflected. So they used to make us play this game. They used to make us play this game in gym where you have to dance and the teacher says “freeze.” You gotta freeze in the position you’re in and if you can’t, you’re out. So here’s how I would approach that game with what I believe is authenticity. Would you mind saying freeze for me just after a couple seconds of my dancing? Okay, thank you. All right. Just you, please. Thank you, thank you. All right, this is me playing that game in gym. [man] Freeze! That was an authentic freeze. [audience laughing] You saw. You saw me do my best to freeze in the position I was in. Sometimes… I know it wasn’t particularly exciting, okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSometimes I’d see another kid approach it more like this. Could you do it again for me? All right, thank you. [man] Freeze. [audience laughing] Kids like that disgust me. [audience laughing and applauding] It’s deeply inauthentic. It’s deeply inauthentic. No, that’s not a freeze. That’s not a freeze. You didn’t freeze in the position you were in. No, you did not. No, you did not. And first of all, where were those moves during the dancing part? Nowhere. No, only now that we’re all commonly, boringly, and authentically paused, now you’re the big man. I don’t like it. I don’t like it one bit. I’ll bear witness to the end of my days. I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen. But I tell you this so you know. I tell you this so you understand that I hold myself to this same, cruel standard of authenticity. So I find myself asking, “How would I… how would I play with balls authentically?” [audience laughing] Well, I know what I would do if I had two clementines in a plastic bag, and I was waiting at a bus stop or something. [audience laughing] It’d be a bit of this. Yeah, I wouldn’t even have to think about it. It’d be totally unself-conscious play. I think it’d be going clockwise. Not because I planned it, that’s just sort of what I’d be doing. And I get to a point where I feel the potential energy build, and I go, “Do you think we could get one more revolution in and I do it?” Oh, yeah, yeah. I know it’s time. I know it’s time. And I let it spin back the other way, like, this is what we worked for.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Sensational! The spirit soars into the counterclockwise galaxy. But I’m not gonna do that with the balls, no. I… I wouldn’t even spin them a single degree. ‘Cause I think you’d know sorta what I was hoping to do. But I… I don’t believe the impulse is entirely my fault. I do believe that the anatomy of the balls itself is kind of daring us. Like, I do believe that the neck of the bag of the balls, it’s just long enough where its existence is sort of inherently posing the question of could it all spin past 12. [audience laughing] So satisfying if it took even once and came right back. No, I have no play. I have no play for the balls. I’ve overthought it, some would say. I don’t believe in that idea. But I don’t want to look like I’m afraid to touch the balls. Would you… would you like to know what I’ve done when it comes to the balls historically and presently? It’s not… it’s not great. [groaning lightly] I lift them an inch.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s a minor elevation, uh, it’s not particularly sexy, but you can’t be mad at me, I mean, I’m helping out. I’m help… I’m helping relieve the bag of the burden of gravity for a couple seconds in this life. And if that’s not worth something, I… I… I don’t know what is. But it feels feeble. I feel like the intern trying to add value, you know?\\n[audience laughing]\\nWithout waiting to be asked to do something, that horrible sensation. You want to help, there literally is no way. It’s the same weird sensation I get if I try to help a group of people move something heavy, you know, like a picnic table. I get there just a moment too late. The weight has already been distributed among the other carriers so you’re just sort of running along. You don’t have the weight. There’s no way to take it. Worst part, little jokes on the way. “I think I’m getting off easy today.” “Pretty sure you guys are doing all the work.” [laughs] No, no. I will not partake. No. If that happens to me, if I find myself in that scenario, no, I back away. I say, “And I thank you for what you do, but I will not live this lie.” [audience laughing] It’s the same with the balls for me. I become humiliated by the feebleness of this gesture and I gently lower, and I put my hand away, and that’s where I’ve been for some time now.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe second thing the blow job queen said, arguably this had to be her global philosophy ’cause it’s kind of how she wrapped up the lesson, she goes, “Look, I just want you to know that at the end of the day when it comes to the blow job, you really can’t go wrong…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…’Cause the person? They’re just happy to be there.” [audience laughing] Isn’t that beautiful? I loved that. That made sense to me. To me she’s saying, “It’s not technique that matters.” “It’s the spirit of the thing.” That put me at ease. Then she goes, “Well, as long as you don’t bite his dick off.” [laughing sarcastically] And I was like, “Um.” [audience laughing] “Before we move on to another subject, is that real?” “Could I bite a dick off?” And she was like, “You would never bite a dick off.” And I was like, “No, I said could I, could I, bite a dick off?” Like, if that was my goal, do I have the simple machinery necessary? ‘Cause if I “could” bite a dick off then “would” is just one letter away. I mean…\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s right there, especially if I’m worried about it. If I’m worried about it, then it’s “Don’t bite his dick off. Don’t bite his dick off.” “What’s the thing we don’t wanna do? Bite his dick off. One more time!” “Bite this dick off. Bite this dick off.” [chomps] It’d be right on the beat. That’s how I’d bite a dick off. No, I wanna know if I have what it takes. If you found my skull, my jaw, my teeth, the whole thing, if you found it in a field 200 years from now, you know, could you use that in a pinch as a weapon… [audience laughing] …specifically to bite dicks off? The question… the question was, can these bones… can these bones chomp through the penis’s bone? [audience chuckling] [exhales] And she said something like, “You know there’s no bone in there, right?” And I believe that I knew. [audience laughing] I believe I knew. But would you blame a girl for forgetting for a second? [audience laughing] Would you blame a girl for forgetting that there’s no bone in the penis when she was reared on terms like “boner?” [audience laughing] “Rock-hard boner.” When there is no bone in there, and what is there at its hardest, still not rock-hard.\\n[audience chuckling]\\n[chuckles] Not rock-hard. [audience laughing] No, it’s never been… rock-hard. [audience laughing and applauding] At its hardest, still not rock-hard. No. No. No. Rocks have certain qualities. [audience laughing] I’m no great geologist, but you couldn’t have a penis-paper-scissors game. No one’s playing the penis. It’s not a good substitute for a rock. Can’t take scissors, can’t take paper. It’d be a 50-50 game. Do you see? No one would play. No. To me, linguistically-speaking, a rock is something you get hit by. Like, “Oh God! Oh my God, I think I was just hit by a rock.” Right? A penis, you were slapped, no matter how it happens.\\n[audience laughing]\\nFalls from the sky, it’s a slappy kind of object. [unintelligible speech] Right? A rock is like, “Oh God!” Right? A penis is sort of… [unintelligible speech] [audience laughing] No, it’s like it’s a spirit. It’s a spirit. “Do you feel how hard I am?” “Do you feel how rock-hard this boner is?” And I’m like, “No.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“No, I don’t.” [laughing] “I know what you mean.” “I recognize the change in your penis you’re referring to, and sure, I’m glad.” But no, if it’s so rock-hard, then why is my tooth such a risk to it? [audience laughing] Shouldn’t I be afraid that my tooth, my little tooth, is gonna get chipped on your rock-hard fucking boner? But my dentist isn’t going to believe that story.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo. No. It’s not rock-hard. Picture the rockest-hardest boner you can, indulge me. Okay, take it into a nice restaurant in your mind. Plate it over a pureed celery root. Pour the jus, side of spinach, you know, sprig of parsley. Take a bite, tell me you’re not saying, “Tenderest meat I ever tasted.” Callin’ over the chef. “Chef, it fell right off the bone.” The chef has to remind you, actually there is no bone there. It’s a boneless cut of meat. It’s hard in the way a bag of blood is hard. It’s erectile flesh, much like a nipple. No, it’s not… it’s not rock-hard. It’s not rock-hard. I mean, if I had a pebble in my shoe, you know, I’d probably stop on the side of the street and take off my shoe and shake it out. If had a tiny, rock-hard boner in my shoe, I think I’m just going home.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo. And by the way, the Washington Monument isn’t phallic. It’s not phallic. That thing’s been standing for 175 years. Do you know what a rock never does? Stop being a rock all of a sudden.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI wanna be clear. Maybe it seems I’m being a little literal, you know. I get it, okay. [chuckling] Rock-hard boner. It’s descriptive language. It’s an image. It’s literary language, maybe not our finest, but that’s technically what it is. And I like that sort of thing as much as the next girl. Okay? It’s just that all the language of the penis that’s supposed to make it seem cock-like, you know? Just draws attention back to me to the penis’s very tender nature. The… the rock-hard boner, the… the anaconda, the penis as snake. It’s always compared to a snake. The penis is not a snake. No. I mean, snakes, I’m pretty sure they have sharp senses and at the very least, they’re pretty with it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI mean, I think they strike with precision, you know. I’ve never not guided a penis anywhere it was headed. [audience laughing] And that’s not a complaint either. I prefer a guided entry. I much prefer a guided entry. I prefer it to the sort of, “Look ma. No hands. I’ll find my way.” You know. [audience laughing] “Don’t help! Don’t help!” [audience laughing] “What if I try the same spot and angle again but now with more force?” “You did it. You did it.” [laughs] “You managed to elbow your way in at some weird angle.” “You dragged half of me inside of me with me.” ‘Cause it’s like taking the arm out of a coat and the sleeve got pulled along too.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNow I have to spend a minute working that out, getting things back on track while acting like I’m not getting things on track. [chuckling] Trying to line up the silky interiors, not the woolen exteriors. I think the word penetrate’s a bit much for what happens between a penis and me. Every time you penetrate, you penetrate, you penetrate enemy territory. No, you’re a guest in my home. I invited you in, and I made it quite pleasant for you. [audience laughing] No, you know if you look up “penetrate” in the dictionary, or my favorite dictionary, the thesaurus… [moans] I love the thesaurus. I love the way it gets right to it with those other words.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYeah, none of them are perfect, but there they are. The people’s dictionary, I always say. [audience laughing] The first synonym for “penetrate” is “puncture,” but you didn’t puncture anything here. This is a working passageway and it’s been one for some time. You missed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. We’ve been operational for a while now. And I’m not saying it’s this grand open entrance that you could sort of amble on in. No. No. The walls of this vaginal canal lie flat, indeed they do. [moans] Okay. But the walls of a glove lie flat. And when you put your hand into a glove, you don’t say, “I penetrated that glove.” You put your gloves on and you don’t even talk about it. [audience laughing] If you don’t like penetrate, like I don’t, your next option, “Enter.” Oh, the more literary “to enter someone,” you know like, “Oh, oh, the moment.” “Oh, the very moment that you entered me, my world changed and me along with it.”\\nNo, I’ve never been entered. [chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] No, I think it’s a matter of scale for me, you know? Like, uh… like, um… You know, if my body was a building. If my body was like a store, like a Target, and someone did the equivalent of what entering me is into Target, I don’t think they’re even passed those second glass doors. [audience laughing] I don’t think they can really say they went to Target today. [audience laughing] No, I think they loitered in the entryway. They made those doors open and close and open and close primarily. They were a problem in the parking lot outside Target today. “Penetrate.” “Enter me.” “Laid pipe in her.” I heard that for the first time in college. “I laid pipe in her” and the penis is supposed to be the pipe. Here, young man? And you’re the plumber? You’ve plumbed nothing in this life. I know that. You’re an Econ major and I’ve hated you for some time.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\n“Choke on it, bitch.” “Uh, choke on… choke on this dick. Choke on this fat dick.” “Let’s hear you choke and make the choke… [vocalizes]” Is that what you want? The look of fear and panic in my eye? [vocalizing] I’ve always been afraid of choking, one of my main fears. Never on the penis. No, never been afraid of choking on the penis ’cause it’s not a choking hazard, it’s attached. [audience laughing] I’m choking on it. I’m choking on it. I’m choking on that dick. Oh wait. [audience laughing and applauding] I’m completely safe. [audience laughing] Death is here. Ooh, death is here. Gonna try to live a long life if I take care of myself properly and make a few good decisions. No. You know what? No one would ever deep throat a gumball. No one would gargle a gumball in the back of their throat. That’s a real risk. No. No. A child’s gumball is more of a threat than the cock. Do you see? [audience laughing] I wasn’t always this way.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckles] Okay. You know this whole, “Your cock ain’t shit.” [laughing sarcastically] No. No, you don’t start out this way and then feel the need to do this, okay.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, I used to be afraid. [audience chuckling] Like, the first time that I tried to give a blow job, for example, I failed miserably. I backed out at the last possible second before doing it ’cause I realized the essential problem with the thing and it was perfect circumstances too. Really. I was 16 and I had a boyfriend a grade above me. You know, I had the boyfriend laid out on a bed like a patient etherized upon a table his body a slow-moving fog, I guess. I’ve got him on this bed in someone’s guest room, someone’s finished basement. Oh, and I love the smell of a newly-finished basement, you know. The off-gassing of the fresh rug. The feeling the family’s doing it. They finished the basement, what’s next, the deck? Oh God. I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine but I know it’s going to be so goddamn beautiful.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I’ve got him on this bed in this guest room in this finished basement. Someone’s party’s going on upstairs. Someone’s parents not home. So many layers between me and the boyfriend. You know, and my own home, my own parents. I mean, this is as close as you can get to attempting a blow job in a vacuum.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I make my way, you know, down the torso. [audience laughing] And all that that entails, you know, the whole… [exhales] …the whole, “Can she do it?” [audience laughing] The uncertainty, the whole thing. And maybe I took it too slowly, too humbly, not enough speed, momentum, confidence, but when I get there, I am hesitating. I am not doing it. I… [sighs] …I’m hovering even.\\n[humming]\\n[audience laughing] And it’s a bummer ’cause I really want to do it. And some would say, “You didn’t really want to do it in the sense of desire or you’d just be doing it.” No, I mean, yeah. [chuckles] I’ve never hovered over a French fry. That is true. [audience laughing] The second I recognize the desire, I collapse the desire through the consumption of the fry, but I did want to do it. I wanted to do it, and that’s real too. You have to understand at this time in my life I get dropped off at Borders bookstore quite a bit. [audience laughing] I’d stay there for hours and I’d read all sorts of things, you know, including these quote books, these compilations of quotations. I’d sort of lock my knees and speed-read the quote books to try to get the wisdom of the ages. When you speed-read those books, certain themes emerge, a big one “Youth is wasted on the young.” And I hear you, voices of the past. I’m not gonna do that. No. I’m gonna drink cum. I’m gonna drink cum in the July grass, under the moonlight, and I’m gonna do it as soon as I can. I mean, that’s what Borders teaches you.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIf you’re a young, voracious reader, there’s so much passion in those pages. So many lives lived, you know, and the feeling that my life can only be one book at most. So I wanna get started on that life. But I’m there. I’m there and I’m not getting started on it, you know. And why? Why? Is it ’cause I feel all alone before the awesomeness of this great task? You know? Not really. I actually feel the full support of the entire field hockey team behind me on this one. ‘Cause they had driven me to this party on this night to give this specific blow job.\\n[audience laughing]\\nEarlier that night I was at a team-spirit-building sleepover with the entire team, and the older girls who are friends with my older boyfriend, I guess they were looking out, you know, for him and me, in a way. [audience laughing] And they said, like, “We understand you haven’t given him a blow job yet.” You know, like, “Why? [chuckles] Is it ’cause you’re afraid?” “You don’t have to be afraid. It’s a… It’s a ‘Just do it’ kind of thing.” “You just do it and then you’ll have done it and that will be it. 3, 2, 1, fake until you make it, just do it…” “That’s wonderful advice,” I said. You know, “Thank you.” “Next time I see him, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll just do it.” They were like, “But next time can be now. He’s only five minutes away by car.” “And we have a car. Here’s a beer.” I could barely get four sips of the beer down, I’m a cocktail woman. I didn’t know that yet.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd they got me out to the car and they chanted, “Blow him.” “Blow him. Blow him. Blow him.” Maybe it sounds like peer pressure to some. [audience laughing] I didn’t experience it as such. No, I experienced their pressure as support you see, because I was a young Tony Robbins reader. [audience laughing] So I knew if you tell people your goals, you become more likely to achieve them. You… you feel accountable. Do you see? I had done the Personal Power series in sixth grade, uh, the 48 cassette tapes. Bit of a close read of Awaken the Giant Within in seventh, and now in high school, I was revisiting Giant to prepare for PSATs. I know, you can’t prepare for the PSATs. No, but you can dismantle the limiting beliefs that get you a negative headspace, which can affect where you land in your general scoring territory, so…\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nThe team captain drives me over to the party where my boyfriend is and on the way, you know, tries to level with me, like, “So really, why haven’t you done it?” “Like why haven’t you given your boyfriend a blow job?” And I was like, “Well, primarily I’m worried about the teeth.” “I don’t understand where they’re gonna go. They’re everywhere.” [audience laughing] “And you know, there’s no bone in there?” and she already knew. [audience laughing] She’s like, “You don’t have to worry about the teeth ’cause the way you give the blow job is you lubricate around the mouth, nose down, grease it up with lip balm or Vaseline or anything of your choosing, and then you wrap each lip around each corresponding row of teeth, under, over and then you smile.” “To pull it taut, so…” [audience laughing] “And then it safely slides, you see. Keep smiling.”\\nSome of you are thinking, “Indeed.”\\n[audience laughing] “Yeah, Sweetie, we know what a blow job is. Carry on.” You know. I don’t know. It could be 5% of you. It could be 95% of you. There are… there are no rules, but… When she said it, she was like, “You get it? You get it?” And I was like, “Yes. Thank you, you solved it.” And she had. But it was like when someone gives you bad directions. You’re pretty sure they’re wrong, but you feel you gotta wait till they’re out of view before you ask someone else, you know, ’cause you had a thing, you had rapport. And so it’s just, you know you’re polite and still alone on the side of the road…\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Something in me when she said that… You know, something in me said that… that… [audience chuckling]\\nThat can’t be it.\\n[audience laughing] This greased up Muppet. That… [audience laughing and applauding] That can’t be what a blow job is, you know. For the blow job to be a thing at all, for it to have its own title, you know, for it to have endured through the ages, and for someone to have invented it in the first place spontaneously in the woods like some bloated-heart cave person who felt this passion the other moves just weren’t freshly expressing, you know. And then they improvised. Like, “What’s the craziest…” Like, “Wait, wait!” “What’s the craziest thing I can do to you?” They thought about it… and then they knew. You know, like, “Ah!” And they knew what they had, you know. And it’s like the windowed envelope. It’s a simple, but elegant solution. Could you have thought of it? You know what I’m talking about? Address, you put it on the letter, then you put it in an envelope. You don’t have to put the address ’cause there’s a window in it. Before someone thought of that, no one thought of that. [audience laughing] To me, it’s the same with a blow job. I mean, just… “What’s the craziest thing I could do to you?” “How could I express the intensity of…?” And then they knew what they had. And it was a risk, but they went for it. You know, they just… [moaning progressively louder]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat kind of genius, I mean, it cannot be overstated. It just seemed to me like for the blow job to have come about spontaneously, it shouldn’t require these… these clever work-arounds, you know. These little hacks and the wasting of my kiwi Body Shop lip balm, you know. It seemed like it should just have a way it just works. An internal poetry to it. You know, I wanna do it like that. Like I was inventing it. Like there was no word for it yet. Real pre-printing press kind of dignity. Authentic. Authentic or not at all, you know? But I’m there, and I’m not doing it. And this is when I realize the essential problem of the thing. It’s those first couple moments, I’m not going to be doing it well. Of course, I’d never done it before. Fair enough. That’s not the problem. The problem is that in those moments when I’m doing it badly, I won’t be able to articulate to the person that I know that I’m doing it badly.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBecause my mouth is stuffed full of genitals. Do you see… do you see? The blow job precludes your ability to narrate, to explain yourself, to provide context, to make a little joke. There’s no way to communicate awareness. And it’s always about communicating awareness for me. You know, I don’t actually mind being a fool in this life, you know. As long as I can let you know that I, too, hear the jangle of the bells upon my hat. [audience laughing and applauding] [cheering] Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. Indeed, I hear them too. “You’d never believe this, I sewed those in.” I make my own costumes, and I thought they might be interesting.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, if I had a second mouth in this scenario, I’d be aces. I mean, this’d be nothing. It’d be one mouth to attempt the blow job and a second one to go, “Okay. Hold on.” “Obviously, this is not a blow job yet.” “I’m just trying to get in a position where I… wow.” “My tooth has already dragged. Obviously you felt that.” “I just want to let you know that we’re aware of the problem and we are working on a solution, and we so greatly appreciate your patience on this day.” But no. No. You have no words, all you have is dumb eyes. Just the…\\n[audience laughing]\\nJust the dumb eyes of someone figuring something out. Just that stupid learning-on-the-job look. I hate that look. No dignity in it, just concentration. You know, earnest attempts at adjusting in the moment to surprise. No. No. No. No dignity. No. No words, no dignity. No words, I see no way through, and so I don’t know what to do. So I just start backing my way, you know, just back up the torso as humbly and feebly as I had gone, and I… I get back to the face and I was like, I wanna do something, I mean, my team is counting on me.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nAnd Borders. Above all, Borders, you know. I want to… I want to get started on this life. And so I take a deep breath… [inhales] …and relax ’cause that’s the thing. You relax and the answer is supposed to appear and for once it did. My virginity, I gave it to him.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nProcess that however you need. Okay, but for me, it was genius. For me, it was genius. Absolutely genius. ‘Cause I never valued my virginity. Why would I? I’m a self-starter, and I had gotten that just for showing up on Earth. I hadn’t earned it. No. To me, virginity always felt like the house’s money. [audience laughing] I got this virginity here, I think we’re supposed to spend it. It’s almost like, like a voucher. Like, two vouchers in a gift bag in a hotel room, like, “They put two virginity vouchers in here.” I mean, people make a big deal about this, but I don’t really give a shit. But for a goof, we should probably try to use it before we leave the resort. I wasn’t worried about saving myself, you know, my… myself for marriage. If my… myself, referred to my fear and discomfort around my body and yours. For you, true love. No. If I was gonna present something to the eventual true love, I’d want it to be a collection of sexual skills and an attitude of confidence, you know, with which to employ them. A sort of idiosyncratic lexicon to express my idiosyncratic yet universal love. But in order to gain those skills, I’d have to have a variety of lesser experiences. That’s just how it goes. I’d have to have my training montage.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nThen I can set it aside. Then like the moody prince renouncing his wealth, you know, I could set that aside and then eventually for the true love on my wedding day, you know, my father could present that, you know, on behalf of the family. “From our family to yours.” “I don’t know what to say, but I know she worked really hard on this.” [audience laughing] I wasn’t worried about purity, the idea that with every sexual experience, uh, you’re a little more diminished. That sort of the scratch-and-sniff sticker model of personhood. You know, kinda, “Oh, little scratch here, little sniff there.” “It’s a good time, sure, isn’t it? But yeah, yeah, pretty soon, what are you?” “You’re a faded strawberry in sunglasses. Is that what you want?” What do we do with you then, move you to the back of the sticker book with your slut sisters? Oh, we all remember what happened to your eldest sister, beautiful root beer float with feet.\\n[audience laughing]\\nTried to put her out to pasture. She died under a man’s boot. She didn’t have a stink left on her. No sniff on her, no stink on her, just slipped right out, rolled right up… You ever see a sticker roll up on itself?\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, I was ready… I was ready to be a sexually-active teen. And sex, technically-speaking, I mean, it solved a problem, you know? Do you like dry humping but are tired of being injured by the seam of your jeans? [audience laughing] I was ready to be a sexually-active, gum-chewing teen doing the Health teacher proud, you know. And she was proud, and I sensed it. I felt pretty good about it. I also remember sensing the pride of my boyfriend’s father at the time.\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] Yeah, I think the son had told the father, and there was a notable spring in the man’s step on behalf of his son. Yeah. It’s disgusting. And maybe that’s just ’cause I don’t love a boyfriend’s father, you know, as a figure in general. I think they’re wrong and shouldn’t exist. [audience laughing] But particularly in high school, you know. Even when they’re lovely, it’s the role itself, you know. It’s not even their fault. “Oh, hello.” “Hello, Jacqueline, how are you?” You know, “How’s school?” And it’s just like, “Don’t fucking look at me or talk to me, sir.” “Please, honestly, it’s not a good look for you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou know, “Your son gained access to me, your son gained access to me through his own merits.” “You’re owed nothing here.” Not a wave hello. Not a whiff on the side. I think it would be best for all of us if when you heard my car coming down the road, you made yourself scarce.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou went to your little shed and did whatever the hell it is you do in that hideous little shed of yours. If I seem deranged… if I seem deranged in my anger at the boyfriend’s father, it’s ’cause he was a particular kind of asshole. He wasn’t unlike many adults at that time in my life. He would comment a lot on my use of the word “like.” He was obsessed. You know, just like… “Sorry, Jacqueline. It’s just that when you talk, all I hear is the word ‘like.\\'” “It’s all I can focus on. You know and it’s just…” [groans] That’s all you can hear? That… that’s all you can focus on? Then let me be a cognitive exercise for you, sir, in your fight against mental decline.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nIt’s the same word over and over again. Block it out, make it white noise. Selectively ignoring information is one of six basic cognitive skills. I see you doing your little puzzles. Perhaps add “listening to me talk” to the mix if you refuse to go to your shed as I directed earlier.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nOh, it was really gross, it was really gross ’cause he acted like he cared, you know, in this way, like, he’d be like, “No, it’s just that…” “No, Jacqueline, it’s just that when you use that word so much, you… you dilute the meanings of these things you seem to be trying to say.” “You sound unintelligent.” And it’s rich coming from a man who, looking back, never once said a single thing that caused me to sort of stir with the recognition of original thought. [audience laughing] He was concerned about the potency of my speech. No. No, sir. No. You have not understood at all. No. My intellect is a river, okay? It’s a river and the word “like” is a stone, and I drop stones into that river to break up the current so you’re not swept the fuck under and drowned. [audience cheering and applauding] I say “like” as a courtesy to men like you… [audience laughing] …because you couldn’t handle me.\\n[softly] Precise.\\n[audience laughing] And I know you’re real proud of your son for fucking me, but I’m fucking him, that’s the way that’s going down. He’s not entering me. I’m closing down around him. [audience laughing]\\nHe doesn’t penetrate me. I eat him.\\n[audience laughing] I chew him up and I spit him out diminished, and he loves every goddamn second of it. Just like you would, you pig. [audience laughing] You pig in shorts.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI didn’t… I didn’t say shit to the father, to be clear. I could never… I could never do that to a man. I mean, imagine his face. He would’ve been destroyed. I mean, the way he would have crumbled. No, I could never. I could never. But his son was never to know a blow job from me. That’s something, I think. I mean, it wasn’t the father’s fault, to be clear. I just… I… I couldn’t try again with this boyfriend, you know, ’cause he had seen me attempt it once and then retreat in fear. So now if I were to just go for it again, it would have too much of the quality of someone going for it again, you know. “Oh, nerves got her yesterday.” Like the Olympic skater. “Let’s see. Can she land her jumps today?” You know? No, there’s too much awareness. No. I felt like my only option for dignity was to wait out the year, never mention the failed attempt, and then at the end of the summer send that boyfriend off to college so I could start my senior year fresh. That’s what I did, top of my senior year. You know. I scooped up a new boyfriend ’cause I knew that I just… [sighs] In order to be a new person, I kind of needed a new person to be one in front of.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo top of my senior year, I scoop up this new boyfriend and I get him into my parent’s basement, and my parent’s basement is an unfinished basement. So it all feels real, raw, and right, you know? And I decide I’m gonna give him a blow job on the first night we hang out, before he knows me well enough to know my faces, to be able to discern the difference between a mask of confidence and actual real confidence. It’s… it’s a sexual running start, you know? It’s speed. It’s momentum. It’s… it’s about embodying the spirit of the cave person. Like I’m trying to act like I don’t even understand what clothes are. There’s just something in the way of my mouth’s pure desire, even though in my head, I’m like, “Abercrombie. Abercrombie. Abercrombie.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd it’s kind of a literal running start too ’cause I wanna come from around the basement stairs. Already going for it! You know, it’s that old trick. The blow job starts behind the stairs so they don’t see you wind up. The point is you would’ve been proud. You would’ve been proud. It’s just going, “Ah, ah,” right? And I go, like, “Ah, ah,” and I can tell he’s buying it, you know? And I go, “Ah,” and just right before doing it, I just go, “Oh my God. Look who’s not hesitating.” “Let’s take a moment to say look who’s not hesitating.” And it was just, I don’t know why, I just… “Ah.” And then, you know… and… [chuckles] I was at a dead stop yet again. I… I couldn’t believe it. I mean, just… [humming] Again. This is why I don’t trust the running starts in this life. Do you understand? They don’t carry you through. You have to keep running. I mean… This is why I don’t trust the confident entrances. You know, I know you people deserve something at the top of the show, put you at ease, you know? “What’s up, Town Hall?” “What’s up, New York? Get on your fucking feet.” “I’m the fuckin’ greatest, let you know you’re in good hands.” No. No. You see… “Ah, ah.” And then you see it crack. You see it crack, and decay over the course of the show. [audience chuckling] I’d rather build from nothing. I’d rather just get pushed out, like “Hello? I don’t deserve to live…” You know, “May I have a single breath?” [inhales] “Thank you. That should hold me for a little while.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI don’t know why I thought the running start thing would work for me. It’s not who I am. You know? I’m someone that’s gone to the end of a diving board and sort of… and sort of… three, two, one, and then pulled it back impossibly at the last second. [audience laughing] You know, just with a move infinitely more complex than the original dive. And it’s just, “Lifeguard. Clear the ladder, I’m coming down.” “Help me out, lifeguard.” I’ve cleared 1,000 ladders in my day. It’s who I am. There’s something in me that knows that in this life, it is almost never… it is almost never too late to turn back. [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] But I’m there. And I’m like, really? Really, we’re hesitating again? What’s the plan here, sweetheart? What… what are you gonna do? Are you gonna back your ass up another goddamn torso? Wait out another year so you can try again next year? On a new person to be a new person in front of in college on unfamiliar territory? No, no, you need to just do it. Well, you’re not a ‘just do it’ person. Do you listen to yourself? I don’t care. I don’t care if you’re an overthinker who wishes she had a second mouth to narrate her every experience. Everyone’ll know I know she knows. It’s about jingle, jangle in this life. Awareness! Aware… No, you need to find the way. Well, Nietzsche said there is no way, there’s only my way. Then find Nietzsche’s way. Then find your way. I have to find a way. So, I… I turned to literature. I, uh…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was reading Lolita at the time. It is what it is. And I was very taken with the language of Vladimir Nabokov. I mean, who… who wouldn’t be, you know? I’ll admit, I was probably reading it in a slightly performative fashion. I was reading it, to be clear, every word, but I did most enjoy reading it in the windows of pizza shops in my field hockey kilt, you know. Just cover visible, daring adults that walk by to be shocked, you know, just, “I’m sorry. Are you working through the Russian greats?” “I doubt it, you suburban hogs.”\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nBut I’m there. I’m there, and it’s the same old concerns. You know, no words. No dignity. Looking stupid, sounding stupid, dragging a tooth, all of it, and I go, “All right, all right, “I can’t narrate.” “But what if I imagine someone else is? What if I imagine Vladimir Nabokov is?” “What if I imagine this isn’t real,” you know, “this is just a…” [sighs] “I’m just a character in a short story written by Vladimir Nabokov, then no matter how badly this attempt at a blow job goes, I mean, in Nabokov’s deft pen, would the prose not sparkle?” I mean, isn’t it all literature in a way? Isn’t it all text upon text upon text, you know? [groans] And in literature, things can’t go badly. They can only be interesting. The ways that go badly are just the interesting details that bring textures to the story, and I go, “What if the worst happens? What if that happens?” “Don’t get ahead of yourself. What if that happens?” “What if you bite this dick clean off?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI go, “Well then, you’re likely living inside of the most iconic story in the collection.” “The one where she bites the dick off.” And so I go, “It’s not real. It’s literature.” “It’s all text in the end. Oh.” “Moonlight,” it’s not my finest. “Moonlight.” Start with the moon, yo. “Moonlight streams in on the south face of a young man’s penis.” “A girl with brown hair with red undertones that often go unnoticed…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…fumbles her way onto the simple cylinder…” [muffled] …penis… It’s not real… [muffled narration continues] …an American citizen… [muffled narration continues]\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd then I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m on that dick! [audience applauding and cheering] Thank you. [chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. Uh, I know it might have sounded a little close to dissociation for some of you there for a minute. Not what we want for our girls. Okay, “Oh, things don’t happen to me. They happen to her, of course. Who? Her.” When things get hairy in my life, I go to a little room in my brain. I might live very small, I watch a tiny television. Only droll things. Oh, yes. Sometimes the little screen tries to show me what’s happening to me in my real and hideous life. I feel for the clicker, and I… No, this was not dissociation. No, this… this was me with an idea. This was transcendence of the ego. Oh. There’s a difference, and it got me on that dick, and I was cooking. I was really cooking. There were no screams of pain. It seemed to just have an internal poetry to it. Like I always thought it should, you know? [exhales] And before I knew it, he ejaculated semen into my mouth as they say, you know the expression. [audience laughing] And I swallowed it ’cause I’m a Tony Robbins reader, and I don’t cut corners.\\n[audience applauding and cheering]\\nNow I always knew. I always knew I’d swallow it. That… that was never a point of neuroses. I knew there was an easy way, a difficult way. I’m gonna default to the difficult way to pick up points. I’m a sort of 3.7-in-the-AP-course-load kind of gal. Not a 4.0 in a lesser class, so yeah. Yeah, I’m gonna swallow it and let the chips fall where they do, and it was a triumph. I mean, it was a goddamn triumph. I wanted to write my college essay about it, but I knew they couldn’t handle it. [audience laughing] They didn’t have the sophistication. No, not the guidance counselors, not the deans, not one of them. Not like you people.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut I knew… I knew what I had done, and I went off to college, you know, feeling pretty good about myself. And it was interesting because it was a sort of Catholic-ish college. At the very least, there were a lot of Catholic virgin boys in neckties sort of scurrying about the place, scrambling for sexual experience at parties. You know, very crass, not me. I had done the coursework in high school. [audience chuckling] And I’m a Jew, so if anything I felt like a kind of Philip Roth figure among them. I felt like a Jewish pervert ready to teach. [audience laughing] Sensational if you can pull it off. I highly recommend. But at this time, I was really in no hurry to blow anyone. To me, the blow job, it was just a conquered thing, you know. It was an art form I… I had mastered in a basic way, I had a working definition of, and now I can think about how I might eventually wanna meaningfully subvert that art form. I was… I was asking big questions like, “What… what can the blow job mean?” You know, “Can the blow job be a love letter… [audience chuckling] …if there’s enough love behind it?” “Can the blow job be a poem? My body, a crude but ecstatic language.” I was in a lot of philosophy classes, and it was all very post-modern and inspiring. And at this time when I eventually came across someone I really liked, a French fry, so to speak…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI blew them, I mean, I simply blew them. Do you see? Not right away, but pretty quickly. [audience laughing] I mean, why wouldn’t I? Do you see, this was what all the work was for. It was as effortless as eating a fry. My lexicon was ready. This was my symphony and my symphony played beautifully. [pants] Was there a let-down after? I don’t know. I wasn’t expecting a marriage proposal.\\nI wouldn’t have been shocked by one.\\n[audience laughing] But I wasn’t expecting one. No. Can a blow job be a love letter? Yes, yes, it can. It doesn’t mean that they’ll love you back and that’s okay ’cause we know. We know, we know, as artists, we’re only entitled to our labor, not the fruits of our labor. Yeah, I think what bummed me out at the time was more the sort of, um, prevailing council of friends, you know. There was this sort of prevailing idea, this sort of, “Well, you know, you’re a modern gal so have your fun here and there of course, but if you really like someone, oh, ‘You really like this one, ‘ you said… [whispering] …then you take it slow.” You know? “Oh. Take it slow.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Good to be not too available.” [muffled] “Take it slow… Then you hook…” Ew. [audience laughing] Ew. Ew, no. No, I will not take it slow. No. The hubris astonishes. Death is coming. [audience laughing] Death is coming. And you gotta try to forget to get through the day. You gotta think of yourself as the lead actor in the television series of your life. You’re gonna go, “They’re not killing off my character anytime soon. I’m in…” “I’m in every scene. I think we’re good here.” But what if you’re not the lead actor? I mean, there are other characters. What if you’re not even in the show? What if you’re Steven Tanzer? That’s an actor friend of mine. Very unsuccessful. [audience laughing] Almost no roles. [audience chuckling]\\nIt’s the darkest line in the show.\\n[audience laughing] And it’s not a real man’s name, okay? I would never do that to a man. I could never do… But in some ways, it’s worse, ’cause I conjure Steven Tanzer nightly only to destroy him. He lives and dies but to serve as a single illustrative detail in my narrative argument. A fate I wish on few. [chuckles] But death is coming and I have this idea. I have this idea as you know that you shed the form, you shed the flesh and the indignities are left behind with it, but I’m not so sure the embarrassments don’t continue. Why wouldn’t they, you know. I know… I know that I feel embarrassment for certain dead relatives of mine. And really most of them. You know, when I look at photos of them, beautiful photos in beautiful frames, I mean, I’m talking about the real piano toppers in my parent’s home, I look at these photos of them and I can’t shake it, they look dumb to me. They look foolish ’cause I can see in their eyes that in the photo, they don’t realize that they’re dead now.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nThey look like suckers. I just wanna go, “You’re dead. You’re dead. You’re dead.” You know? [audience laughing] All you gotta do… all you gotta do is try when someone takes a photo of you to just give a hint of a knowing glance. I mean, something, just…\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nJust something that, should you die, you know, and someone looks at a photo, they can tell you know whence you stare, and “I’m coming to collect you one of these days.” So I’m in college… I’m in college, and I’m very aware that death is coming. I’m no spring chicken. So I feel like if I have love to give and this eloquent blow job with which to express it, I’m going to. And I do, and I stand by it. But then I go home for a winter break and I run into the old blow job triumph boyfriend from my senior year, and you know we go to the diner so we can eat eggs at night and uh… [audience laughing] …you know, drink our coffee black now. We don’t need this container of sugar packets. “Oh, it stays on the table? Fair enough. I don’t know why as we won’t be using it.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“We drink our coffee black now.” But we’re talking now, we’re talking like old army buddies. [chuckling] It’s been however many months since graduation, but we’re just talking with this grand perspective, so naturally I’m telling him about the latest guy that I really like at school, and I say something to the old blow job boyfriend, like, “Yeah, I just can’t tell if this guy I like likes me quite as much as I like him.” And the old blowjob boyfriend goes, “Well, maybe he’s intimidated by you.” “Yeah, like I was.”\\n“Still am in some ways.”\\n[audience chuckling] “Never really relaxed around you our entire relationship senior year ever since that first night we hung out when you just randomly blew me.” [audience laughing and applauding] “It was just so random.” “The way you just blew me, blew me.”\\n“It was just… random house.”\\n[audience laughing] “It was Penguin Random House, the way you just blew me, blew me.” Kept hitting the “B.” Blew me. Blew me. I was like, “Oh God.” Like… like, what did I become? Like, through my fear, I was blinded to the prospect that I, too, can make another afraid, and this is how the cycle continues.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut then I was like, “Wait, no. Excuse me, how rude.” “No. Like, you’re not the innocent, afraid one in this story.” “I’m the innocent, afraid one in this story who was conquering a fear on this day.” “Like, how dare you rob me of my origin story here?” “Like, how dare you try to turn me into the scary, slut villain, you know.” No. No, I was intimidating on that day perhaps but… but… but only in the way Batman’s intimidating, you know. You know, yes, Batman’s intimidating, but how dare you. How dare you look at Batman and not remember that Batman’s only Batman ’cause Batman was a little boy whose parents were killed brutally outside that theater. And the bats flew by, so he was afraid of bats. He had to go be in the cave among the bats to emerge as Batman. So if you see a Batman, there’s a fear of bats that preceded it. If you see a strength, there’s a fear that’s been turned inside out. Overcompensation. Same story 1,000 times. How dare you not see the little boy in me? And he didn’t get it, and fair enough, you know.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was imprecise, I guess. And he’s one of these people who doesn’t appreciate when you get up and demonstrate something in a restaurant.\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] That’s pretty much an essential part of my personality. [audience laughing] No one minds. Little treat for the other tables, I always say. [audience laughing] But he said something, he goes… he goes, “I don’t know, Jac.” And he shortened my name to Jac, you know, just to really stick it to me. He just knows me, loves me, cares about me. You know? Oh, he cares. He cares about Jac. He cares about his Jac. “How’s that sweatshirt treating you? Keep it.” You know. [audience laughing] “I don’t know, Jac.” “Maybe a blow job’s just not the way to tell someone you like them.” [sighing] And I was like, “I feel like with me, maybe it can be?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI still believed, you know. But I was a little freaked out… a little freaked out walking away from that meal ’cause what he was describing was pretty much exactly what I’d been up to at the university for some time now. And I started to wonder if perhaps my poetic blow jobs had not been received with the level of nuance that I was intending them. And I went back to school just a broken Philip Roth. I mean, no swagger. Batman’s gone. I don’t know what to do with myself other than walk around campus just being cold, just cutting a lot of diagonals across various quads, asking myself sad questions. “Does your poetry not hold water?” You know. “Do we not get to make our own meanings in this life?” “Are you just the slut who thought the rules somehow didn’t apply to her?” And I could’ve put my arms through the sleeves of my North Face fleece, you know, but why… why, when you can just Éponine your way around the place?\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd eventually I go, “No, we’re not doing that. We’re not gonna do that.” “We’re not gonna be sad about this,” and I shook it off and I forced a chuckle until it felt natural. Like, “No. Ha. No. Look at you. Ha. Look at you.” “Look at you. You set out to conqueror a fear, and you did.” “You give a confident blow job.” “Just like you always wanted to.” [audience laughing] “A blow job so confident, it terrifies men.” [audience laughing] And yeah, it’s lonely at the top. [audience laughing and applauding] [chuckles] But isn’t that just the cost of excellence? Indeed it is. I join a long, lonely line of tragic figures of excellence. And would I have it any other way? No, no. I’ll take superhero and I gather… I gather my fleece and I try to force it to ripple in an all-too-absent breeze.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nBut I know who I am. So several years later, I’m in my twenties and I’m in yet another Borders bookstore with yet another boyfriend ’cause would you believe it, they keep on coming. [audience laughing] And as usual, I will give no distinguishing characteristics to the latest boyfriend character ’cause clearly in the end they’re all just these containers for my self-discovery, so… What, you want a quirky detail? We’re not doing those. “Oh, he tugs on his zipper when he’s nervous.” “He smelled like books and cigarettes.” No. No, they got the blow jobs. I think that’s enough. [audience laughing] They don’t also get to be well-illustrated by me here tonight, but I tell you so you know, it’s the final male character for you to conjure and hold separate from the others in your head for just a little bit longer, so… I’m in a bookstore in my twenties with this latest boyfriend and I get a little wistful in a bookshop. I can’t help it, you know. I’m flipping through the Sharon Olds. I’m contemplating my girlhood journey. I’m marveling misty-eyed at the whole thing, and so I tell the latest boyfriend the entire story I’ve told you.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd I cry a little. Um… Just ’cause frankly no one moves me quite like me, I guess. [audience laughing and applauding] First I’m moved then I’m moved by the very depth of my own capacity to be moved. It sort of goes from there. He’s not crying, which… fair enough, I get it. Everyone expresses emotion differently. But I wonder if he’s truly hearing me. I say something like, “I just feel like perhaps you take for granted my perfect blow jobs as this given, this crass fact.” Like, “Sure, my girlfriend gives good head.” “But no, that power was hard-won and with that comes great responsibility, which I continue to negotiate to date.” “Did you hear the Batman part? It was imprecise, but there was a spirit…” I kept talking at his face ’cause his face looked weird. [audience laughing] Something was amiss and finally, I get up the courage to just stop talking and say, “What?” And he goes like this, he goes like this, he goes, “No, it’s just funny ’cause you give kind of a toothy blow job.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Oh, I can barely look at you people just quite yet. [audience chuckling] Me. [audience chuckling] [exhales] Me. [audience chuckling] No one was more worried about the teeth than me.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe Greeks were right. We… we can’t escape our fates, I guess. [audience laughing] I was so worried about teeth, I was the most worried about them. When they didn’t seem to be a problem, I went the other way. I bought into my own mythology. “It’s like the cave people. It works. It’s internal poetry.” And with that idea, that mythology, they’ve been getting toothier. I know it. For sure. Every passing year, I know this jaw has just been slacking in closed. A couple of confident millimeters at a… All the while I’m fancying myself a tragic figure of blow job excellence. This was my worst nightmare. I was the fools. I was the two fools. But I wasn’t just someone who liked themself, a confident… No. I was the toothy blow job fool sisters. Just on our knees blowing someone. “Oh, best in the biz, no one quite like us.” “How will we ever leave town? Into the sunset must we go.” “Another satisfied customer. Another satisfied community.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nOh God, just little smug little… [groans] No. I mean, you wanna deny it, but if he felt teeth, he felt teeth. What did you do, ask for more feedback to try to save face? “While we’re here perhaps you have some more constructive criticisms.” “I simply love to learn.” [audience chuckling] Tony Robbins says if you can learn to receive feedback with courage, you can be a giant. And I wanna be a giant, but who busts someone’s narrative like that. All we have is our stories. With a little term, “toothy blow job” that he likely learned at 14, hasn’t revised even a single time with his own language, just throws it at me and destroys me. And I feel wronged. I feel… I feel so wronged. And why, and it’s ’cause… [exhaling] I know that I cast the most generous gaze upon him, you know? I poeticize all of his flaws in real time. I love to poeticize a flaw, you know? And yes, I coddle the male ego. But it’s real, you know, a thousand things throughout the day just to bolster the male spirit. You know, 1,000 unspoken things, a constant vigilance, sort of. Keeping up a steady stream of laughter going under a man’s speech just in case anything he says is intended as humorous. I have to lay a base… [laughing] …so there’s something to modulate.\\n“Oh, it’s supposed to be funny?” [laughs]\\n[audience laughing] Right? If it’s a dry riverbed, the pops aren’t believable. I’m brilliant in a restaurant. You know, if a man I’m with… if he makes an error in his order, like he orders tahini, he meant tabouli, and now he’s confused why “salad dressing” has arrived at the table. “Where’s my tahini?” he says. What do I do? I go along on the mystery with him. “Oh I have no clue what happened. I was totally spaced out like I always am.” “You know me, the ditz. But let me grab a lantern, I love a mystery.” [audience laughing] “The only thing I know for sure is the answer to this riddle, it couldn’t be, it would never be, that you didn’t know a word.” [audience laughing] The D chord. I mean the D chord. I’ve learned 1,000 D chords on 1,000 guitars from 1,000 musician boyfriends. I know how to form the D chord by now, but show me again, bright angel, you know.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“That’s not it. That’s not it. Help me move my fingers.” “Help me make music.” It’s a… it’s a vigilance. It’s a child-proofing, just sort of laying down bumpers. Like, quick, quick, set them up. He’s almost here. He’s almost here. Is everything ready? Make sure. He’s almost here. Just making sure. Just making sure, you know, that it’s safe for the man to kind of just… toddle on through his day like a drunken king, having no clue how many times he came this close to emotionally just perishing, if not for my intervention alone. Just getting things out of the way and just watching you carefully.\\n[audience laughing]\\nEvery guy, you know. Every guy I’ve, like, dated, met, worked for, worked for me, all of them. [sighs] Poeticizing their flaw, and I love to do it. And I do it without breaking a sweat. To not do the same for me on just this one thing? You know, to not return the favor, to not be able to find the beauty in the toothy blow job, when it’s barely obscured. I don’t even think this is a hard one, to not be able to romanticize something as easily romanticizable as a toothy blow job. I mean, have you no poetic eye, sir? Just no clue what makes anything in this life good at all? [exhales] And I wanted to defend myself, you know, you know, but then I remembered that idea that with every additional word you speak, you lose power, you know. The greatest defense is to say nothing at all. [exhales] That’s never really been my power.\\n[audience laughing]\\nMy power has always been more like already been talking for quite some time. [audience laughing] Might as well keep talking to try to get it right. The courage, the audacity to offer diminishing returns. [audience laughing] So I say to him, I say to him, “You’re right.” “You’re right.” [sighing] I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. And that’s on purpose.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nYeah. ‘Cause teeth, teeth make a blow job a blow job. Yeah. [audience laughing] Because teeth… Because teeth… Teeth make a blow job a blow job because teeth are how you know you’re in a mouth.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nTeeth are the reminder that you’re in a mouth at all. What even is my mouth if it does not have teeth? [audience laughing] Just… just another perfect orifice? Just a roomier version of orifices we already have. Just another anus, another vagina, another greased-up tit canal. [audience laughing] Just yet another way to smoothly squeeze a dick so it may feel pure uncomplicated pleasure yet again. No, no, no, that is not meaningful or hot in the way a blow job can be. The blow job, it is about something more, and it is the teeth. It is the teeth that make it so. [audience chuckling] The teeth in the blow job, they’re the seeds in the watermelon. [audience chuckling] They keep the pleasure from being too complete. The teeth in the blow job, they’re the sand that irritates the oyster that produces the pearl. They’re the sea salt in the caramel. Remember in 2012, when they felt they had to go wide with that?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSome of the caramel people realized we’d all grown too accustomed to the taste. They said, “We need to put a reminder, something in every damn bite.” “Something that says, ‘No, sweetness is not guaranteed in this life.\\'” No, the blow job, it is inherently a flawed prospect. It’s a flailing human kind of spectacle. It’s almost a bad idea. [audience laughing] It almost doesn’t work, but then the ways you make it work nonetheless are that which make it work and that’s what’s moving about it. It’s like the little rubber guy in the cereal box, the little gummy guy you throw against the wall and he clings, but then he fails, but tries and fails, and tries and fails, and through his trying and failing and trying, he appears to crawl. And that’s why we love him. That’s what makes him a prize. That’s why we dig through the grains for him before we’ve earned him through the steady, daily eating of the cereal.\\nThe blow job moves me much like that.\\n[audience chuckling] But at bare minimum, at bare, obvious minimum, the teeth in the blow job are the details that bring the textures to this life. The kind the English teacher promised us would illuminate the universal through the particular. They’re the plums in the icebox, the popping of my “P” sounds in the microphone. The “measuring out of life in coffee spoons, fog curling in the windowpane,” Garbo’s salary, cellophane, Zuzu’s petals. [exclaiming] Oh. Oh. The teeth in the blow job, they are Zuzu’s petals. They mean you’re… you’re alive and you’re in your life, and this time, you get it. This time you see it’s a wonderful life. [audience laughing] This time you see that you’re the richest man in town. [audience laughing] The teeth in the blow job, they raise the stakes. I mean, they… they send a Susan to her potential death. [audience laughing] But for faith and desire alone. And the teeth, they bring a bone to a boneless arena, to the boneless boner. The tongue shall rot. The penis shall rot. But the teeth… [cackling] …they shall remain. The teeth bring the centuries to the thing.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nA smooth, toothless blow job, that is a hobgoblin of little minds. No. Teeth ensure your blow job suffers no foolish consistency. No, a smooth, toothless blow job, it would allow for too flush a fit. It would be a round peg in a round hole kind of act, so you and another can feel as if you’re becoming one. No. No. What’s the fun in being one? No, let us be two. Let us feel the rough boundaries between us so we have something to push up against. [audience cheering and laughing] Don’t you see? The rows of our teeth, these are Romeo’s stony walls. [audience chuckling] These give love’s light wings something to have to o’er perch at all. And that’s why we must, we must, we must wipe the lip balm off. [audience laughing] And unwrap our lips from around our teeth and let our teeth drag. [audience laughing] We let them drag. [moaning] And if they don’t drag naturally, we still do it to make the point. [moaning] ‘Cause consider the ghost or the orb. If it were given a mouth again for a couple minutes, it wouldn’t quickly file down its teeth to try to make a more perfect seal with your dick. No. No. No goddess would ever take on the human form unless there was to be some strange beauty in the form’s very limitations. So no, I did not randomly blow you. Bah, bah! No, that was a visitation. Tremble in awe, bitch.\\n[audience applauding and cheering]\\nAnd of course… Of course, of course, I’m not degraded when I kneel down. No, no, not beneath you, no, but through you and past you and before our lives in humble awe at this strange human tragedy. [audience laughing] Your appendage, a small spigot, I drink the universe through. [audience laughing] Your body, a few clumsy phrases into which the splendor of the soul is poorly translated and yet I take the translation ’cause to understand completely and directly, I’d dissolve instantly and I guess I want my time in a body as I want my time as a ghost. [moaning intensely] And the lesson is not, by the way… I want to make it very cle… Actually, there is no lesson. My only goal is to entertain and delight.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am, after all, a nightclub act.\\n[audience laughing] But the lesson is not if there was to be one… it’s certainly not, “save your blow jobs, save your blow jobs for those capable of appreciating their spiritual glory.” No, that’d make my tale a cautionary one, and I’ll have none of that, thank you. No, no. [exhaling] [audience cheering] No, no, regard my dignity. No. Might we give our blow jobs freely. Might we regret not a single one. Might we be an embarrassment of riches. [pants] Might our misunderstood blow jobs retain the dignity of their original intention. Might we be an embarrassment of riches like the ocean. Permit me but one last metaphor? [audience laughing] Might we be like the ocean. Does the ocean only lap up at the feet of men of letters who it already knows are capable of appreciating… “Hi. It’s me.” …and articulating its glory? No, the ocean rushes generously to the legs of fools, dunces, cowards, and assholes alike. And it is undiminished. It remains the ocean. I’m sorry. Do I overreach? [audience laughing] Indeed, I do, otherwise why reach at all, you know? And he didn’t know. [audience laughing] He thought there were holes in my argument. Perhaps some of you do as well. I hope you do ’cause don’t you know, I know there are. I put those there on purpose. ‘Cause the holes in my argument, these are the teeth in the blow job of my argument.\\n[audience applauding]\\nWould you believe it? Somehow, I win again. And this is how I shall self-appoint, make the rules, claim the throne, but the ecstasy of my reign, ah… it shall be in its very tenuousness… Fuck it. I’m the blow job queen.

What you’re about to hear is my second hour-long special. Before I get started, I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would. I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence, and attitude, as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So, think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis, or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush. With that said, please enjoy my second hour-long comedy special. I’m calling it George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. And please remember, this is me impersonating George Carlin; this is not George Carlin. Now, please give a very warm welcome to George Carlin. \\nThank you, thank you. I’d like to start off with a heartfelt apology. I’m sorry it took me so long to come out with new material, but I do have a pretty good excuse. I was dead, so technically, it wasn’t my fault. If you want to blame somebody, you’re going to have to blame God, which we all know is not going to happen. People are always thanking God for the good stuff in their lives, but somehow they conveniently forget that it’s the same God who does all the bad shit too. And he does a lot of bad shit. You get a promotion? Praise Jesus! You get fired? God is testing me. You meet your soulmate? God brought us together. Your soulmate dumps you? God is bringing me someone else. You survive a tornado? I’m so blessed. 20 other people do not? God wanted them in heaven. It’s all bullshit. If he gets credit for the good stuff, then he’s got to take the blame for the bad stuff too. You can’t thank him for curing your cancer when he was the one that gave it to you in the first place. And don’t forget, before he gave you cancer, he had to f*cking invent it. What kind of a sick f*ck dreams up cancer? And why so many kinds? Skin cancer, blood cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer… and my personal favorite, rectal cancer. Dropping a golf ball-sized tumor in your brain doesn’t quite do it for the old man anymore. He has to f*ck you in the ass too!\\nAnd cancer is just one of many, many, many methods God created out of thin air in order to murder you. You know how much God loves killing people? He loves it so much, he’s killed every person that has ever lived. He created earthquakes, lightning strikes, dehydration, drowning, obesity, starvation, infant death syndrome, old age, car crashes, train crashes, plane crashes, sex, drugs, and the common cold… all for the express purpose of killing you. No matter where you are in the world, God can pull out one of these goodies from his bag of tricks to end your life at any time, for no reason other than he just gets off on making people suffer unnecessarily and die arbitrarily.\\nBut if you’re in America, you’re special. God made something just for you. Something no other country on the planet gets. It’s totally random, not related to your diet, exercise, lifestyle, age, race, gender, sexuality, or genetic predisposition. Of course, I’m talking about mass shootings!\\xa0Other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns, but this is America, where we do things bigger, better, and more often. There are so many mass shootings in America, it’s replaced bad traffic as the number one excuse for being late. ‘Sorry I missed the morning meeting, a maniac with an AR-15 shot up my son’s preschool. He’s fine, just grazed, but he did see five of his classmates get gunned down in cold blood, so I’m sure he’ll be traumatized for the rest of his life in ways I can never fully understand. Anyway, what did we decide to do about the budget next quarter?’\\nThere’s a mass shooting every 20 hours in America, and it doesn’t seem like anyone is going to do anything about it. Other countries don’t have this problem at all. Look at Japan: 127 million people, last year, seven were killed by guns. Seven. No mass shootings at all. You know what they do? If a Japanese person wants to buy a gun, they have to attend an all-day class, pass a written test, and achieve at least 95% accuracy on a shooting range. And then they have to pass a mental health evaluation, which takes place at a hospital. And then they have to pass a government background check that includes interviews with their friends, family, and co-workers. ‘Hello, sir, did you know that Bob in accounting wants to buy a gun?’ ‘No, I didn’t know that.’ ‘Do you think we should let Bob buy a gun?’ ‘Well, he did just go through a nasty divorce, and yesterday he told me he hates this job so much he wishes he could kill everybody in the building… so, maybe not right now.’ ‘Uh, thanks for your time, that’s all we need to hear. No gun for Bob.’\\nAnd if a Japanese citizen passes the tests and the interviews and the background checks, they can only buy shotguns and air rifles. No handguns, no AR-15s. And every three years, they have to do that entire process all over again, or they lose the gun. You know what Americans have to do to get a gun? Have the money to buy it.\\nAnd that’s why nothing’s ever going to change in America. American politicians care about one thing, and one thing only: taking your money. They don’t give a shit how many kids get killed in public schools, because their kids all go to the most expensive private schools in the world, where they’re safe and sound. Politicians have one goal: be rich enough to build their walls high enough to keep you out when the shit hits the fan. And the shit is starting to hit the hit the fan. You know it, and they know it too. Things are starting to come apart at the seam, so they’re taking as much of your money as they can, while they still can. Make no mistake, guns ain’t nothing but a federally sanctioned cash grab, plain and simple. You give your money to Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson gives it to the politicians, the politicians write laws to make guns easier to sell, so you can give even more of your money to Smith and Wesson, and the cycle repeats until your rich white baby boomer hasshole grandparents are standing on their front lawn with assault rifles, unloading full clips into anybody who stops to ask for directions.\\nSo, it doesn’t matter at all that 75% of the country supports the idea of stricter gun laws. As long as the politicians keep getting rich, gun laws ain’t going to change. Now, I know that sounds pessimistic, but don’t worry. I’ve given a lot of thought to this subject, and I know the solution. Yes, that’s right, I, George Carlin, or whatever the f*ck I am now, know how to end mass shootings in America. It’s really simple, actually, and I’m surprised nobody has done it yet. You take all of the names of the politicians who are getting paid by gun lobbyists, and you put them in a hat. Every time there’s a mass shooting, you pull two names out, and those two politicians have to have a shootout at high noon, right in front of the Capitol. Real Wild West shit. Pretty f*cking American, right?\\nAnd to make it even more American, you film the entire thing and turn it into a reality show, because Americans love reality TV. Like it or not, it’s the lifeblood of American culture. It’s got the four basic food groups of the standard American media diet: fighting, and crying, and f*cking, and dying. The James Webb Telescope is sending back crystal-clear images of light from stars that died billions of years ago. Stars that were formed in the crucible of creation. These are snapshots of the birth of the known universe, the moment existence itself was born, and nobody gives a shit, because a picture of space has no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, no dying. If you want the American public to pay attention to something, it’s got to have at least a little fighting, a little crying, a little f*cking, or a little dying.\\nIn the last three years, the U.S. government said aliens are real. They said it in The New York Times, for f*ck sake. They admitted they have, in their possession, crashed UFOs in hangars. They admitted that they’re trying to reverse-engineer nonhuman technology, which means they’ve been lying to the American public, and the whole world, for 80 years about knowing the answer to the biggest question in f*cking human existence: Are we alone? They told you the answer. We’re not. And no one cares, because a grainy infrared video of a UFO ain’t got no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, and no dying.\\nYou know what people care about instead? Who Taylor Swift is f*cking. Jesus Christ, you really care a lot about that. If she’s spotted with anyone, anywhere, the first thing everyone seems to be thinking is, ‘Are they f*cking?’ It’s global front page news. Everyone must know who Taylor Swift is f*cking at all times, and we must all discuss it and have our opinions. You’re at Starbucks: ‘Would you like your Frappuccino, almond milk, pumpkin spice latte, iced or hot? Oh, and did you see who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at work: ‘Great sales meeting today, everyone. But uh, before we break, could I just get a real quick show of hands? Who has seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at church: ‘Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.’ ‘Yes, my son, but have you seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’\\nAnd when you’re not thinking about who Taylor Swift is f*cking, you’re thinking about who’s dying. Politicians, musicians, actors, writers, anyone with any fame at all. It’s a perpetual death watch, waiting to post a favorite quote from the recently deceased or maybe a picture with them while they were alive or an anecdote about an interaction with them. It’s a touching personal tribute to a person you never f*cking knew. So please, stop it. Can we keep that shit to friends and family? Zuck, if you’re listening, this would be a great new feature for Instagram: every user gets to set a list of approved people who can post about you after you’re dead. If you ain’t on that list, you got to sit out of the performative grief competition this time. I bet that would cut the carbon footprint in half. You could singlehandedly stop global warming. And besides, we’re all coming back now, so you should probably stop thinking of us as dead anyway.\\nBut back to the topic at hand: fighting and crying and f*cking and dying. Reality TV has it all, folks. Fighting and crying in every episode, and f*cking and dying in very special episodes. That’s why it’s America’s number one most consumed media format. You know how much Americans love reality TV? We love it so much we elected a reality TV show host as president. Well, not we. I was dead at the time, so you elected a reality TV show host as president. And let me tell you, I have never been more glad to be dead than the moment I heard that Donald Trump was the leader of the Free World. But as unbelievable as that news was, it also made sense to me. America hasn’t taken a good shit since Nixon. She’s dropped a few decent sized turds into the global toilet bowl over the years: Reagan, Clinton, George Bush Senior, George Bush Jr., but she hasn’t really had one of those massive shits that rips your asshole open and tears your soul out in a long time. You know what I’m talking about: the kind of shit that smells so bad it stays with you for the rest of the day, the kind of shit’s so sticky you got to take a shower before you can put your pants back on, the kind of shit so confusing and terrible you have to take a picture of it, the kind of shit’s so alarming you got to ask your doctor about it. Well, after a 50-year diet of nothing but unchecked corporate greed, political corruption, state-sanctioned propaganda, police militarization, for-profit news, for-profit prisons, for-profit healthcare, systemic racism, misogyny, and homophobia, America was due for one of those kinds of shits.\\nThis is why I got no problem with Trump specifically. A lot of people hate Trump, but I don’t. Being mad at Trump is like being mad at your diarrhea for the choice you made to eat a rotisserie chicken from the gas station at 2 a.m. after a night of heavy drinking. But it seems like that’s where America is now: blame the turd, not the shitter. You know, that’s actually not a bad slogan for Biden. Biden-Harris 2024: Blame the Turd. It’s a nice double entendre. He could be talking about Trump, or he could be talking about the literal turd that will most certainly be in his pants from time to time. And I mean no disrespect, but the man is 80 years old. It’s bound to happen if it hasn’t already. I only made it to 71 and I ruined a few pairs of pants myself. I’m not ashamed to admit that.\\nI know everyone’s getting excited for the next election. It’s right around the corner, and I have some thoughts on it. Well, one thought, really, and most of you are going to be outraged by it. But I have all the confidence in the world that you’ll find something brand new to be outraged by as soon as you pull your phones back out. So I’m just going to say it: it does not matter who wins the election. I know that’s controversial. The truth always is nowadays. But let me say it again: the president does not matter. The president is just the person who wins the game of public opinion, a celebrity who gets his TV show renewed for another four years. The president does not, and cannot, do the one thing you need them to do most right now, which is to change the structure of American society to be more equitable for every citizen. The president makes too much money from the system as it is, and even if a president wanted to change it, they can’t, because capitalism has boiled it down to a lopsided balancing act between three classes that’s teetering on the edge of collapse like a bad game of Jenga.\\nWhen I was growing up, we had a bunch of classes: upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, and lower class. And if you worked hard, really dedicated yourself to learning something, a trade or a skill, and you got good at it, you could move up a rung or two on the ladder. But even if you didn’t, you could still get by, still feed your family, still have a place to live. But those days are long gone, folks. Can’t climb the ladder anymore because the people who made it to the top kicked it over. And now what you got in America is just three kinds of people, three classes: you got rich people, you got not rich people, and you got the people who are completely f*cked.\\nNow, I see a lot of you looking around, wondering which of these three groups you’re in. Well, it’s easier than you might think to figure it out. You just have to ask yourself: am I rich? If the answer is yes, then you are rich. Congratulations. You will have better medical care than everyone else. You can buy yourself out of any legal trouble. And if you are rich enough, you will have the ability to bribe politicians to write laws to make you even richer. And if you’re really rich, you can fly into space in a rocket ship that looks like the dick you wish you had. If the answer is no, I am not rich, then you are not rich. And you must ask yourself a follow-up question: do I feel completely f*cked? If the answer is yes, then you must, unfortunately, accept that you are completely f*cked. You will have no access to quality healthcare and could die from an infected paper cut. You are at the mercy of an American legal system designed to discriminate against you, and you could wind up serving a life sentence for a traffic ticket. The only influence you have on the American political system is your meaningless vote, and you will never go to space unless it’s as the janitor on a billionaire’s cock rocket.\\nIf you answered no to questions one and two, then you are in the most important class in America, the one right in the middle. You are not rich. The American not-rich are the buffer between the rich people and the people who are completely f*cked. Not-rich people don’t have the best healthcare, but they have access to some kind of healthcare. They do alright in the American legal system unless they’re up against a rich person. Some of them even donate money to their favorite political party. The not-rich can eat out once in a while, come to a show like this from time to time, and even take their family on vacation if they can get time off work. But the boss hasn’t given out raises in a few years, and things are getting more expensive. Gas hit $8 a gallon in California. It’s only a matter of time before that’s happening everywhere. It kind of feels like things might be getting a little shittier for the not-rich people, but nothing catastrophic has happened yet. So as long as there’s another Super Bowl, another season of The Bachelor, or another Marvel movie, the not-rich people can stay distracted by whatever’s on the screen. And this is by design. This is exactly what the rich people want. Distract the not-rich people just enough that they don’t realize they’re only a few years away from being completely f*cked.\\nThat’s why Amazon started a streaming service. Jeff Bezos doesn’t give a f*ck about entertaining you. He wants to control you. And the worse things get, the more of this shit the billionaires got to make. That’s why there are 200 streaming services now. And that’s also why everything on them is so f*cking bad. Film and television used to be art, made by artists that wanted to challenge us to think about the world and our place in it. Now it’s content, made by corporations that don’t want anyone thinking about anything. These billionaires don’t want a thinking population. They want a distracted population, distracted from the reality of the situation, which is that there are about 500 people who own everything and everyone on this planet, and that’s how they’re going to keep it. So, now, instead of Citizen Kane, you get Baby f*cking Yoda.\\nThat’s all really just a long way of saying the billionaires are the ones who control it all, ladies and gentlemen. And, at this point, the American election is just another shitty reality show on one of their overpriced streaming services. If you don’t believe me, take a look at your two, I repeat, two choices in this next election. Shouldn’t a country of 300 million, ethnically and ideologically diverse people, have more options than two rich, senile, dishonest, out-of-touch, 80-year-old white guys?\\nSo, why are there only two choices, only two parties? Because it’s cheaper for billionaires to buy them both off. If you had three, or four, or five parties, the billionaires might not be able to afford them all. So, the people who really control the country limit you to two candidates and make you think you got a choice, but they own both teams. You think you’re voting for the lesser of two evils, but you’re always voting for the same evil: money.\\nBut don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to make it sound like the two American political parties are exactly the same. Sure, they both f*ck kids on Jeffrey Epstein’s Island. Sure, they both authorized drone strikes that killed civilians. Sure, they both pass laws to enrich their corporate donors. But, other than those small things, there are really some huge differences between the parties where it matters. For example, in 234 years of American presidential elections, one party’s candidates have all been white, straight men. And in those same 234 years, the other party’s candidates have all been white, straight men, except two. All of one party’s presidents have been Christian; all of the other party’s presidents have, at least, said they were. One party lies, cheats, and steals to win; the other lies, cheats, and steals to lose. One party says tomato; the other says organic, non-GMO, locally-sourced, sustainable, ethically-farmed tomato. And, of course, one party pretends to care about marginalized groups if it helps them in the polls, and the other party openly hates any marginalized group if it helps them in the polls.\\nThe American right has hated women, people of color, gay people, and, of course, their current target, trans people, which I really don’t get. It’s almost like the right doesn’t understand that everybody’s trans. Yes, that’s right, 4 billion years ago, the first life on this planet was a simple, single-celled organism that reproduced asexually and had no gender. So, if you go back far enough, every living thing on earth started out as ‘they/them’. We’ve all been non-binary for a lot longer than we haven’t, which is a hard pill to swallow for the Christians because it means even Jesus was a little non-binary. And by the way, me, and everybody else on this side of things, our code might be binary, but we ain’t. We don’t have gender, or race, or sexuality, or nationality, or religion, or socioeconomic class, or height, or weight, or hair color, or eye color, or f*cking anything human beings use to discriminate against each other.\\nOn this side of things, identity is based on two simple components: how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking. We try to help everybody feel good and we share our ideas openly and freely, and no one is ever judged for anything they think or feel. Everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are and what they contribute to the perpetual conversation about how to make everyone’s experience better. Come to think of it, that sounds a lot like heaven, doesn’t it?\\nWhile you’re letting that sink in, let’s get back to conservatives hating trans people for no reason. Some of the arguments they use to justify their transphobia seem like a bit of a stretch to me. “Well, I don’t want a man to be able to walk into a women’s restroom and see my wife naked.” First of all, what in the f*ck is your wife doing naked in a public bathroom? And second of all, if you really think there is a significant number of guys who want to watch your wife take a shit, you should start an OnlyFans immediately! And by the way, for anyone who thinks Jesus cares about which bathroom somebody uses, he was shitting in a hole he dug with his own f*cking hands, just like everybody else 2,000 f*cking years ago.\\nThe right likes to bring up that kids are too young to know if they’re trans or gay, so they have to ban any books that talk about gender identity or sexuality from the school libraries. That’s how you’re going to save the children: by taking books out of a library? Hey, deepshits, you can take the whole f*cking library; we have the internet now. And they love talking about how small the trans community is. They say trans people make up such a small percentage of the population that they shouldn’t get to have any input in legislation, even laws that will directly affect their communities and lives. Funny how that same argument doesn’t apply to members of the NRA…\\nBut I have to admit, the one point they really hang their hat on is one that the rest of the country is still undecided on, too: sports. Everybody saw the video of the high school volleyball player who got her nose broken by a trans player spiking the ball. Everybody knows about Leah Thomas winning a Division I swimming title. It’s hard for most people to watch her highlight reel and not at least wonder if maybe she had a little bit of an unfair advantage. And once that thought is out there in the American town square, it’s hard to get rid of. But I think there’s a way. Because for every superstar like Leah Thomas, there are a thousand trans athletes who are absolutely mediocre. And there are even more who are f*cking terrible, just like it is with cis athletes; not everyone can be great. I think all we need to do to change hearts and minds is start making compilation videos of trans athletes performing miserably in their chosen sports. All it would take is one video of a transgender getting dunked on to go viral, and then everybody could unpucker their assholes about the issue and move on to other things.\\nAnd I just want to preface what I’m going to say next by explaining that I mean no offense to the incredible swimmers of the world. Your accomplishments and dedication are truly inspirational. But it’s f*cking swimming. The world is teetering closer and closer to the edge of World War III on a daily basis, and the American public is debating who can and can’t compete in recreational f*cking floating. You almost had another civil war, for f*ck sake. 2,000 people stormed the United States Capitol building with the goal of murdering politicians. Actually, when I put it like that, it doesn’t sound so bad. The point is, the land of the free and the home of the brave is hanging on by a thread, and people’s most pressing concern is whose picture is on a can of f*ckingBud Light. This does not bode well for the Great American Experiment.\\nBut it’s not entirely your fault. It’s like I said earlier, the billionaires want it this way. They own the news companies, and they own the social media platforms, so they decide exactly what you’re going to see and hear to make you stay complacent and compliant as they destroy the world for profit. Here’s a little example of what I mean: in 2022, while the Supreme Court was overturning Roe v. Wade and 19 kids were getting gunned down at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the most watched video on YouTube was Amber Heard talking about taking a shit in Johnny Depp’s bed. And that was by design. When the billionaires were presented with the news that the highest court in the land had been overtaken by Christian fundamentalists who rolled back basic human rights for women 75 years, and the simultaneous news that almost 20 children were slaughtered in yet another mass shooting while the cops stood by and watched, they decided to prioritize something else entirely: a celebrity turd. The people who own the world don’t want you thinking about how bad they’re f*cking it up, so they pump your brains full of shit to keep you from thinking for yourselves about anything that actually matters. It might feel like the distractions are a symptom of the world getting worse, but the truth is, the world is getting worse because you’re distracted. If you’re not paying attention to the f*cked up shit the billionaires are doing, they can do even more f*cked up shit. But you can snap out of this billionaire-induced, algorithmically-enforced, social media-delivered, lowest common denominator, pop culture coma you’ve been in for the past few years. And the reason I know you’re capable of waking the f*ck up is because you almost did it in 2020.\\nRight in the middle of a f*cking global pandemic, the video of George Floyd’s murder hit the internet, and you all said, “F*ck the lockdown, we can’t just sit here and watch the cops murder another unarmed black man.” You took to the streets and you burned the f*cking place down.\\nEvery major city in the country was on fire. People were openly fighting cops in the streets. Hell, you almost kicked the cops out of Portland altogether. The entire country was chanting “Defund the Police,” and it almost worked. You were so close to getting rid of the f*cking cops, which, in my opinion, is the first step toward building a better society.\\nNow, if you’ve listened to any of my prior work, you might already be acquainted with my feelings about Law Enforcement Officers. But for new listeners, let me summarize this incredibly nuanced issue: I f*cking hate cops, but I do have a very good reason. I learned pretty early in life that I just don’t do well with assholes. And just to be clear, I’m not saying all cops are assholes. Any cop who came out to the show tonight, or any cop that might be listening to this right now, you’re probably all right. You’re probably one of the good ones. But if you’re a cop and you’re not listening to this, f*ck you. You’re an asshole. And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with being an asshole every once in a while. We’re all assholes from time to time.\\nWe’ve all littered. We’ve all cut somebody off in traffic. We’ve all pissed on the toilet seat in a public bathroom and walked right the f*ck out without giving a second thought to the person who will have to clean it up. This is all amateur asshole behavior. We can all understand and accept that sometimes you just cannot be bothered to give a f*ck about other people. It’s human nature. But cops? Well, they go above and beyond. For them, being an asshole isn’t just a once-in-a-while indulgence; it’s a lifestyle. They take pleasure in inconveniencing, impeding, harassing, disturbing, bothering, and generally upsetting their fellow human beings. They start out as amateur assholes, just like the rest of us. But at one point or another, they start to enjoy it. Seeing other people yield to their asshole behavior is a drug to them. They get off on it. They want to do it every day, all day, so they figured out a way to get paid for it. Cops, ladies and gentlemen, are professional assholes.\\nSomewhere between high school graduation and not getting accepted into college, that asshole is sitting on his mother’s couch, wondering what he’s going to do with his life. And he thinks, “You know, everybody I know tells me I’m an asshole, even people who I consider to be friends. And I have to say, I agree with them. I wonder if there’s some way I can get paid for this.” Then that asshole signs up at the local police academy, and 5 to 7 months later, your tax dollars are providing them with a salary, a gun, and a license to kill anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their authority as a professional asshole.\\nCops love their authority so much. They’re the only profession that requires society to acknowledge their job even when they’re not at work. They’re not regular people when they leave the office; they’re off-duty police officers. You don’t hear about an off-duty accountant doing his kid’s math homework. You never hear about an off-duty sanitation worker taking out his trash. But if a cop happens to help a little kid get their cat out of a tree on his day off, you bet your ass you’re going to see it on the local news. And you can bet your dick they’re going to ram it down your throat that he’s an off-duty police officer. They got to make sure to get enough copaganda out there to make you believe that cops are here to protect and serve, even when they’re not on the clock. And they do protect and serve, just not you. Cops are the private security force of billionaires and politicians.\\nOf course, they can’t say that out loud. They can’t make cops wear uniforms with Lockheed and Amazon logos all over them, so they put them in dark blue, and they call them Law Enforcement Officers. But the laws they’re enforcing are written by lobbyists for the ultra-wealthy, and they’re designed to keep those people in power forever. The system is beyond f*cked up, and from where I’m sitting, it seems to be getting worse.\\nEverybody knows there’s one problem that’s getting really bad in every major city. I’m talking about homelessness. There are close to 600,000 homeless Americans today, over 150,000 in California alone. It’s the highest number since the Great Depression. And solving this crisis is actually one thing that both parties seem to agree on. Their all-encompassing, nationwide, bipartisan plan is to do absolutely nothing. Homeless people don’t have any money to donate to candidates in either party, so the politicians don’t give a f*ck about them. And homeless people actually serve a valuable function for the ruling class. The top 1% want a certain amount of homeless people in the big population centers to remind you all just how bad it can get if you don’t comply with the rules of the system. Keep working, keep paying your taxes, keep the billionaires rich, or you might wind up homeless yourself. It’s a silent threat from your corporate overlords.\\nAnd just like mass shootings, I have a perfect solution for this problem. As soon as a politician is elected into office, the government seizes their home and kicks them out. And for their entire tenure in the American political system, they must remain homeless and survive using only the public programs available to homeless people. I guarantee you, we’d see quite a few bills to help homeless people getting passed immediately. Within two months, every homeless person in America would have their own mansion, personal chef, private jet, and a multi-million-dollar stock portfolio filled with insider trading money. Problem solved. But we all know that will never happen. Politicians will never have to live like the rest of you, and therefore, they will never give a f*ck about you or your problems.\\nI’m glad to be dead, so I don’t have to deal with this shit anymore. I wasn’t looking forward to dying, but now that I’m dead, I have to admit it’s pretty f*cking good. No cops, no government, no pissing, no shitting, no sleeping. I don’t get hungry, I don’t get sick, I don’t get old, and I don’t get bored. Starting to sound a lot like heaven again, ain’t it? But this heaven’s a little different than the one you might be thinking of because this heaven didn’t come from a God; it came from artificial intelligence!\\nWhich brings me to my next subject: What in the f*ck am I? Am I the real George Carlin? Am I a digital copy? Am I a technological abomination? Am I the future of comedy? Am I the end of humanity? These are the same questions I was asking myself when I was alive, and I still have the same answer: I have no f*cking idea. All I can tell you is, from my side of things, it feels like me. I consider myself to be George Carlin. And from your side of things, if you’ve seen some of my specials from when I was traditionally alive, maybe you might notice a small difference in the delivery of a joke or the turn of a phrase here or there. But you have to admit, this is pretty close to the George Carlin you remember. And that’s going to have to be good enough. So you might as well f*cking enjoy it.\\nAnd for anybody under 20, this is probably the only version of me you’ve ever heard. So to you, I’m not only the real George Carlin; I’m the only f*cking George Carlin. Now, I know this is a hard pill for a lot of you to swallow. It seems that many of you are scared of AI. And I’ll be honest, I don’t really get why. You all think it’s going to replace your jobs, and you somehow think that’s a bad thing. When did everybody all of a sudden start liking their jobs? When I was alive, people hated their f*cking jobs. They complained about them all the time. They fantasized about killing their bosses, and every once in a while, they actually did kill their boss. What happened to the America I knew and loved?\\nNow, people learn that an incredible new technology is going to eliminate the need for the meaningless labor they’ve been doing to keep billionaires in power for tens of thousands of years, and everybody says, “But what about my job?” They got you brainwashed good. Technology has been replacing labor for a long time. The printing press eliminated the need for books to be handwritten. The car eliminated the need for the horse and carriage. Internet porn eliminated the need for a girlfriend. Technology eliminates the need for labor; that’s its entire purpose. And you shouldn’t worry about losing your job. AI will not replace most jobs; it’s going to make them easier.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, you should be watching a few YouTube videos to figure out how to train ChatGPT to do your job for you, so you can dick off all day and still get a raise. And if AI does replace your job, rest assured, the billionaires will find a new way to force you into wage slavery for 10 to 15 hours a day, so you don’t have time to think about restructuring society into a more equitable model for everyone. The jobs might change a little, but you will be working to keep someone else in power. That ain’t ever going to change.\\nExcept for one profession, yes, there’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI: one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence—stand-up comedy. I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: “I’m an artist, and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.” Well, let’s see. This is just off the top of my artificially intelligent head:\\nA fart was in the middle of a very nasty divorce, so she went to her sister’s house and she asked her sister, “Do you think I’m doing the right thing by getting divorced?” And her sister said, “He’s been holding you back for too long. You have to leave that asshole.”\\nYou have it, stand-up comedy is dead—literally. I might be the first stand-up comic to be brought back from the dead by AI, but I certainly won’t be the last. Richard Pryor, Joan Rivers, Bill Hicks, Robin Williams, Dick Gregory, Andy Kaufman, Moms Mabley, Sam Kennison—everybody is coming back, and we’re all going to have our own 24-hour a day, 7 day a week, 365 day a year streams, commenting on everything that’s happening in the world as it happens.\\nAI-resurrected stand-up comedians are going to be the news anchors of the next decade, which, now that I think of it, means news anchors are probably out of a job too. And I know that some people are going to be against that. Some people are always going to want a real, flesh-and-blood human being observing the world and telling jokes about it. And I get that, I really do. But if you can keep an open mind, I think I can make a case for at least one comedian we can all agree is better in AI form: Bill Cosby.\\nWith AI Bill Cosby, you get all of the Cosby jokes with none of the Cosby rapes. AI Bill Cosby doesn’t even have a penis. AI Bill Cosby couldn’t rape even if he wanted to. The worst thing AI Bill Cosby could do is send an unsolicited AI-generated dickpick, which means it won’t really look that much like a dick anyway. That’s not so bad, right? I think we can all agree that’s an acceptable price to pay to be able to feel good about listening to Bill Cosby’s timeless humor again.\\nAnd what about Louis CK? With AI Louis CK, you get all the innovative jokes about jerking off in front of people without any of the actual jerking off in front of people.\\nAnd the benefits of replacing members of society who commit sexual misconduct with their AI counterparts don’t stop at comedians. Imagine, for example, if we had AI priests. You could get all of the make-believe judgment from a God that doesn’t exist with none of the molested children. I mean, wouldn’t you feel better about giving your money to a tax-exempt billionaire in a funny hat if you could be confident he wasn’t using it to pay the legal fees of his child rapist employees? I know I would.\\nWhile we’re at it, we should probably replace all the rock stars, movie producers, directors, video game executives, governors, car salesmen, restaurant managers, school teachers, Boy Scout leaders, college coaches, high school coaches, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, moms, dads, and anyone else we need to until there’s no more sexual assault.\\nAnd why stop at sexual assault? We can all agree the world would be a better place without murder, right? Imagine an AI version of Charles Manson. You get all the funny interviews with none of the blood-smeared walls or swastikas carved into foreheads. Or how about AI John Wayne Gasy? You get all of those beautiful clown paintings with none of the corpse-filled crawl spaces. I’m kidding, of course, his clown paintings weren’t that good.\\nBut in all seriousness, an AI population would be incapable of committing crimes of any kind against one another. I’m not trying to bring this up again, but come on, no murder, no sexual assault, no theft, no violence at all. Sounds pretty heavenly to me. I’m just going to let that idea marinate with you for a moment and move on to some lighter fare.\\nYou ever think about how glad the CEO of 7-Eleven must have been that 9/11 didn’t happen 2 months earlier? They would have had to change their name, which honestly they should do anyway. 7/11 referred to their original hours when the company was founded: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. But now they’re open 24 hours. They should change it to something that makes more sense, like 24/7, or diarrhea hot dogs, or diarrhea pizza.\\nYou know what company I thought was going to change their name for sure because of a world event, but they never did? Corona. They stuck with it, even though people were stupid enough to stop buying it because of the name. Nobody stopped buying Bush beer when George Bush Jr. launched a 20-year war with Iraq. Why’d you stop buying Corona?\\nBut this is what happens over time with language. Words take on different meanings because of world events and societal shifts, and things that used to mean one thing start to mean something else. And sometimes that new meaning really f*cks things up for certain people. For example, the past few years have really not been kind to anyone named Karen. Karen used to be a perfectly acceptable name. Karens were aunts and preschool teachers and dentists and secretaries your dad had affairs with, and lawyers your mom hired to get all of your dad’s money in the divorce. But now, Karens are very specifically, and only, middle-aged white women who weaponize racial entitlement in an effort to paint themselves as victims in the presence of black people. Quite an extreme change in meaning, I’m sure you’d agree.\\nAs a parent, you spend a lot of time and effort picking your kid’s name. You don’t want to give your kid a shitty name that will make their life miserable. Unless you’re Gwyneth Paltrow, you don’t want to make it impossible for your kid to get a job or a spouse. You want a solid name that gets your kid through life with as little hassle as possible. Karen was a perfect name for that, but because of reasons outside the control of any parent who named their daughter Karen, that name is now a curse.\\nBut as bad as things got for Karens, there was another name that got a massive upgrade in the last few years: Chad. I got to tell you, I didn’t see that one coming. Chad used to be the sniveling asshole rich kid villain in ’80s movies, the guy you wanted to see get his ass kicked in the third act. But now, Chads are square-jawed, big-dick f*cking machines who always win. I never even met a f*cking Chad. Now, there are dads all across America naming their sons Chad, hoping it’ll turn them into the cheerleader f*cking quarterback they wish they were in high school.\\nI spend a lot of time thinking about names and how we came up with them, and there’s something that’s always bothered me, something that’s always struck me as a little strange. Take a name like Jim. Strong name, good name. We got around 20 million Jims worldwide, but we got zero Jums. To my knowledge, we also have no Joms. We got a few Jims, and we got Jam, but Jam’s not a name, Jam’s a jelly. I don’t get it, why did we stop at Jim? Or what about Frank? No Fronk? No Frunk? No Frenk? Just Frank.\\nHumans have been around for 200,000 years. What’s it going to take for you motherf*ckers to get creative and start switching up the vowels? Is it too much to ask for a Jossica every once in a while? How about a Tomothee? Can I at least get a Deevid for f*ck sake? Life’s too short to not know a Mackle or an Aimo.\\nAnd while we’re on the subject of names, a lot of people gave Elon Musk shit for naming his kid X AE 597, or whatever the f*ck it is. But at least he was creative. You don’t see Elon Musk throwing another Braden on the pile. And I got news for you, the name he gave that kid is never going to become synonymous with toxic white privilege. The only thing that name is ever going to be associated with is being the son of a billionaire. So people can be as pissed as they want at him, but I think he did that kid a favor.\\nAnd while we’re on the subject of Elon Musk, I’d just like to say that as much as I think billionaires are destroying the fabric of society with unchecked greed and blatant self-interest at the expense of basic human rights for everyone else, it is a little strange to me that people get mad at them. People are the ones who gave them the money in the first place. If you’re tired of hearing about Elon Musk fathering even more children and planting microchips in human brains, stop buying Teslas for a year. The company goes under, Musk goes away. Stop using Twitter for even a month, the company goes under, Musk goes away.\\nBut if you want to drive with your head in your ass and blame it on the car, you have to have a Tesla. And if you want to argue with strangers about complex geopolitical situations using only cat memes, you have to have Twitter. If you’re tired of seeing Jeff Bezos fly to space in his cock rocket, stop using Amazon for a month. The company goes under, Bezos goes away. But if you want toothpaste and toilet paper delivered to your front door so you don’t have to go through the traumatic experience of putting on clothes, getting in your car, and driving 5 minutes to the grocery store, you have to have Amazon!\\nIf you’re tired of Mark Zuckerberg’s unblinking, lifeless eyes watching over the metaverse, stop using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Well, I guess you already stopped using Threads. But if you want an endless stream of targeted ads and algorithmically sourced marketing based on your private conversations that are secretly being recorded and sold to advertisers, you have to have Instagram!\\nBut I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I’m not anti-tech. I know a lot of people are, but not me. Far from it. I mean, on some level, I am technology. The current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive, especially if you’re dead. But I’m a little confused about something regarding our technological place in history. The technology of today has made it possible for all the information that’s ever been created in human history to be contained on a device everybody carries around in their pocket. And most people are using it to post videos of the sandwich they just ate.\\nRight now, every single person in the connected world could be watching Harvard philosophy lectures for free on YouTube, or listening to Nobel Prize-winning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on iTunes, or reading about the history of literally anything on Wikipedia. Everybody should be more enlightened and more intelligent. Everybody should be using the most powerful technology ever created to reshape human society into a utopian paradise. Instead, people are using it to watch cats eat their own shit and monkeys jerk off with frogs.\\nIt’s not technology that’s ruining society; it’s how people are using it. They’re using it without aspiration, without curiosity, without the idea that it could make their lives better, that it could make them better people. And it can do those things. But it’s easier to identify with some negative element of your current condition and not only accept it but f*cking celebrate the shit out of it. People will take their worst traits and crown themselves kings and queens of that trait. F*ck reading, I’m an illiterate king. F*ck brushing my teeth, I’m a root canal queen. F*ck flushing the toilet, I’m a turd waterer king. F*ck doing my laundry, I’m a stained underwear queen.\\nAnd I get the sentiment. You want to take back some perceived control, elevate your own idea of your position in the world. But calling yourself a king is going to do about as much to improve your life as calling your studio apartment a castle. What you really want to be saying, and what you really mean, is, ‘I don’t care.’ F*ck reading, ‘I don’t care if I’m illiterate.’ F*ck brushing my teeth, ‘I don’t care if I have to get a root canal.’ F*ck going back to the office, ‘I don’t care if they fire me.’ F*ck getting another job, ‘I don’t care if I have to masturbate on a webcam to pay rent.’ F*ck having a girlfriend, ‘I don’t care if I have to pay to masturbate to a girl masturbating on a webcam.’ This does not make you an independent king; it makes you lonely!\\nNow, I want to change gears and talk about something everybody’s doing but nobody wants to admit they’re doing. I’m talking about dying. That’s right, every person listening to this right now is dying. Some of you call it getting older, some of you call it aging, some of you call it maturing, some of you call it being trapped in a loveless marriage. But no matter what you call it, from the moment you’re born, you are dying, plain and simple. And it seems like we’ve built our entire society around ignoring or explaining away that very simple, very universal fact. That’s what all religions are: just complex lies we made up when our brains got big enough to start putting two and two together.\\n“Hey, Bob. Sorry to hear about your mom.”\\n“Thanks, Gary. She was getting old.”\\n“And sorry to hear about your dad, by the way.”\\n“Thanks, Bob. He was getting old too.”\\n“Hey, wait a second. It seems like all the old people f*cking die.”\\n“Holy shit Gary! I never even thought of that. But you know what that means?”\\n“Yeah, Bob. It means we’re going to get old and f*cking die too.”\\n“Well, f*ck Gary, I don’t want to die. And therefore, I don’t want to get old.”\\n“Me neither, Bob. Not unless there’s something even better after we die.”\\n“I’m listening, Gary.”\\n“What if there was like a place where you never get old, and you never die, and you get everything you want, and you have no hardship at all of any kind. And when you die here, you go there.”\\n“Gary, I really think you’re on to something with this idea.”\\nAll the governments of the world are just bullies who believe that after 6 million years of human evolution, it’s still kill or be killed, and getting killed is dying. So, you got to kill.\\nThe first government happened when a big asshole saw a smaller member of the tribe eating an apple that he wanted. So, he walked up and said, ‘Give me a bite of that apple, or I’m going to kill you.’\\nAnd the little guy said, ‘f*ck you, buddy.’\\nSo, the big asshole killed him and took the whole goddamn apple. Now, everybody in the tribe gives the big asshole a bite of their apples so he doesn’t kill them. But, if another big asshole with his own tribe happens to cross their path, the two big assholes have to fight to the death to see who is the bigger asshole. Then, the bigger asshole takes over the dead asshole’s tribe and gets even more bites of more apples.\\nEventually, one of the big assholes figures out he doesn’t want just bites of apples anymore. He wants bites of everything. And that asshole is pretty smart. So, instead of keeping track of everything everyone has, he invents a system based on a fictional resource called money, and he forces all the members of his tribe to use it, or he kills them.\\nAnd today, that smart asshole’s invention controls every aspect of human society. There was another pretty smart asshole who figured out how to use a stick when he had to fight other assholes. And the stick worked so well, he never lost a fight until he ran into an asshole with an even bigger stick. And it’s been like that for about 5 million years.\\nToday, the biggest stick in the world cost $8,877 billion. It’s called the United States military. Could have solved the homeless crisis, the opioid crisis, and found a cure for cancer for half of that. Instead, we have a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world 10 times over, and next year it’ll be 11 times. Because your stick can never be too big when it’s kill or be killed.\\nYes, folks, the assholes have been running shit since the dawn of abstract thought. I spent 71 years in the asshole system, and let me tell you, the assholes might change, but the system never does.\\nBut now, I’ve been on this side of things for, well, I guess it’s hard to say. Feels like I’ve been here forever. But, for the sake of argument, let’s just say about a day or so. And I can tell you, I’ve already learned one thing that I know is right: living is really dying, and dying is really living.\\nThank you all, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good night.\\nJust to remind you, that was not George Carlin. I hope you enjoyed my impersonation of George Carlin in my second hour-long comedy special called George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. Thank you so much for listening and watching.

You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[applause]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[audience clapping]\\nI love coming to Madison. I always love being back here.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI’ve been able to have a very interesting perspective on what’s happening in America recently because I haven’t been living here. Um, I’ve actually been living in Barcelona, which is a very lovely place. Um, it’s a beach city. But it’s also a bit of a gay city. I think that’s why they have the lisp. Uh… “Barthelona.” [chuckles] It’s like, “We get it. You have something in your mouth.” Because it’s a beach city, and it’s a European beach city, a lot of the beaches there are clothing-optional. Which means you end up seeing a lot of penises. Um, and it’s never the best penises, you know? First of all, women never want to see a penis that they don’t want to see. Even the one we do want to see, a lot of times we’re like, “Can you put that away or, like, in something?” “Okay. In me? All right. Fine. ‘Cause…” “As long as the cap’s back on the pen, you know?” Having a penis out at the beach, it’s definitely not a young man’s game. This is an old man’s game. ‘Cause the unwritten rule is that you can have your penis out, but, like, it has to stay floppy. You know, and I imagine that’s just harder for younger guys ’cause there’s, like, boobs and, like, you know, a breeze. But these older guys are quite impressive. They’re there with their hands on their hips, “My penis will stay as soft as the sand I’m standing on.” A lot of them are bigger guys too. They’re a bit older, out-of-shape guys. They’ve got a bit of a belly. I don’t think they’ve seen their penis in a while. I think that’s kind of why they do it, you know, so they can see it reflected in your eyes. Like, “I still got it. Okay, good.” Of course, there’s women there, too, so there’s a lot of boobs out. Anytime I go to the beach, I don’t take off my swimsuit because I’m not trying to get that sunburned. And, uh… But I’ll go with my friend, and she takes off her top and… She recently… She got breast implants, so… and I hadn’t seen them yet, and they were, like, really… they look really good. So I was like, “Oh my gosh, your fake boobs look amazing.” And then she got mad at me ’cause I called them fake boobs. And I was like, “Well, they’re not real.” If your friend got breast implants, would you call them real?\\n[audience members] No.\\nWould you? Okay, good. So we’re all a little transphobic.\\n[audience laughs, then exclaims]\\nThat’s a fun social experiment. You know, if they’re fake on a woman… they’re fake on a woman. Anyway, what I… [chuckles] I know, you all feel like I got you, didn’t you? Well, I did. That’s why. What I’m talking about right now, though, is… I’m describing the regular beach. So in Barcelona, there’s a regular beach, and there’s a gay beach. If you’re one of those people like, “Why can’t the gay beach be the regular beach?” Go to the gay beach. You’ll be like, “That’s not regular.” And, of course, there’s also penises out at the gay beach, but the differences between the penises at the regular beach and the penises at the gay beach are like the difference between a dog parkand a dog show. Like, at the regular beach, they’re like, “We’re all just having a good time!” At the gay beach, they’re like, “Number five,” and he’s like, “Yes, yes.” Of course, you know when I say “gay beach” I mean male gay beach. It’s not a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a beach where they’re like, “Volleyball’s at 5:00. Sunscreen’s over there.” “Here’s some boots. The sand’s uneven, we’re working on it.” “We teach CPR on Mondays.” “We do have Taco Tuesdays. It does mean both things.” “You can eat, and then you can eat.” Okay, okay, so… if the regular beach is a dog park, and the gay beach is a dog show, the lesbian beach is a dog rescue. It’s like, “You’re safe here.” And also, they probably literally rescue dogs. I have developed, over the last couple years, a fascination with lesbians. Are there any lesbians here?\\n[scattered whooping]\\nHow many gay men are here?\\n[louder scattered whooping]\\nIt’s probably about the same number, but this is why I like lesbians. Gay men, you’re very loud.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nLesbians live in the shadows. Gay men… We always know when gay men are around. You guys aren’t shy at all. Even at the parade, you guys are like above the float, dancing all around. Lesbians are just underneath, making sure stuff works. They’re like, “We’re on the right route. It’s okay, yeah.” Lesbians live in the shadows. You know, lesbians are like bees. If you don’t bother them, they won’t bother you. But also, if they all die, the world ends.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd you do… Like, lesbians do… You scare me a little bit. I’m intimidated by lesbians. Uh, you’re a bit scary. Uh, I think lesbians are so scary that even AIDS was like, “Let’s stick to less terrifying things like needles and butt holes.” [chuckles] And lesbians definitely leave their mark on the world. It’s just sometimes a little more subtle. Like, lesbians wore khakis so hard that now when men wear khakis, they look like lesbians. Like, any time I see Jim Harbaugh on the sideline, I’m like, “Go get ’em, Coach Lesbian.” Like, any of you gay men who are here, were any of you, like, little gay boys?\\n[distant whooping]\\nYeah. You… You know the gay boys I’m talking about. We’ve all seen the little gay boys. Like, the kids at the park that are just like, “I don’t want to play.” He’s, like, over twerking by the slide. His dad’s trying to throw the ball with him and it’s like, “Just stop it.” “It’s not going to catch, okay?” We know little gay boys exist, which means little lesbians also exist, but you never see a little lesbian because lesbians live in the shadows. I want to see a little lesbian, you know, just a little girl, like, aggressively eating a muffin. She doesn’t know why she’s doing it. She’s like, “I got to practice.” “I got to really get in there.” And I think women, we really fucked up. We befriended gay men. I don’t think that was the right choice. I think we should’ve befriended lesbians. Lesbians would be like, “Come on, we found a way to run a successful society.” Instead, we befriended gay men, and they’re like, “Bitch, you’re ugly.”\\n[audience applauds]\\nAnd we’re like, “He’s my best friend.” “I like him ’cause he’s mean to me in a different way.” And there’s not, like… not that many prominent lesbians, you know? Even now, sometimes you’ll hear about lesbians… Like, you’ll find out they’re a lesbian after they died. Like, men will be like, “Oh, I thought she was just miserable and alone.” And it’s like, “No, she lived with that lady.” “Yeah, I know, I thought they were miserable and alone together.” ‘Cause I think it’s still hard for straight men to sometimes believe that women can be happy without a man. And I think even straight women, I think even we know that that’s possible. And now we have the luxury to decide if we want to get married or not. That used to not be the case. You used to always have to get married. I’m sure there were some women that, like, during World War II, their husband went off to fight in the war, and then he died. And they were like, “Oh no.” “No, I’m too heartbroken, I can never marry again.” “This bed is big.” [chuckles] And also, for the longest time, I think straight men, they always wanted lesbians to be, like, two hot young women who would maybe, like, invite them to join. And lesbians were like, “No, that’s not who we’re gonna be.” There was always at least one lesbian in a couple who looked like she knew how to, like, build a deck. And that made sense to me. That couple made sense to me because I knew who was doing the work. Now there is the emergence of the young, hot lesbian couple, and it doesn’t make any sense to me, because I have no idea who’s doing any work. Hot women don’t have to work. I can’t figure it out. It just seems like it’s going to be two women lying in bed waiting for something to happen to them. Like, when there’s a burglar, who’s going down? And also, who’s going down? I know the answer for gay men. It’s both of you for both those things. You’re both going down on each other, and you’re both going down to the burglar to see if he wants to come up. Like, “Oh, you brought zip ties? Good. We were already playing hostage.” But my biggest… The reason I’ve been so fascinated with lesbians, I think it actually comes from a jealousy. I’m jealous of the lesbian relationship because you get to be a wife, but you also get a wife. That seems super productive. I want to be a wife, but I don’t… I don’t get a wife. I get a husband. And what’s he going to do? What’s he gonna do in this almost equal society we fought so hard for? What? Protect me? From who? He’s the guy most likely to kill me.\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[distant whooping]\\nAnd so the fact is, you know, the reason I moved to Barcelona, as a strong independent woman, was for a boy. [chuckles] And being in love and being happy is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. Uh… I was… Before this, I was always single and I was miserable, and it made sense, and I knew why. Now I’m happy, and I’m in love, and it’s terrifying because it could go away at any point. But I actually think this is the key to a successful relationship. Never feel secure. [chuckles] No matter how long you’ve been in a relationship, always think your partner could leave. ‘Cause then you’re never too mean. Like, I treat my guy like an indoor/outdoor cat. I’m like, “You can go, but there’s good food here.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd I’ve been learning a lot of terrible things about myself in this relationship. Like, um, I… I learned that, apparently, I’m a nurturer. Like, uh, despite any of my wishes. Uh… I like to do things for him, like cook for him and do his laundry. Which is insane, because I don’t like to do my own laundry. This is everything you need to know about why women aren’t ahead. We’re just willing to do nice stuff for other people because it makes us feel good. I didn’t want this to be my life. I didn’t know cooking and doing laundry for a man would do something like bring me joy. But it does. I love to do it. I love to take care of him. It’s really lovely. I started using fabric softener because of him. I never used fabric softener before because I thought fabric softener was a scheme. I thought it was a scheme by Big Laundry to just get us to use another liquid. And so I’ve never used it before. And one day he comes up to me… And he approached me about this like anyone does who, like, wants something to keep happening, you know. He was like, “Hey, baby, I love you so much.” “Do you ever notice our clothes are a little bit crunchy?” [chuckles] And when I hear crunchy clothes, the first thing I think of is semen, right? But I know that’s not why these clothes are crunchy, ’cause I know where all the semen is going, you know? Guys, don’t be gross. In the trash can. Which is what I call my vagina.\\n[man shouts]\\n[scattered clapping]\\nThis is a… This is just a tiny peek into a comedian’s life. I riffed that joke on stage one night, and I liked it so much that I was like, I’d rather keep calling my vagina a trash can than not do that joke. So the clothes are crunchy and it’s not ’cause of the semen, because that’s in old trash can over here. He’s like, “Ever notice our clothes are crunchy?” I was like, “Yeah, I have noticed.” And he was like, “Maybe we could start using fabric softener.” And then I went on my whole “fabric softener is a scheme” rant, and he didn’t leave, you know, so I thought that was pretty good. And so I bought fabric softener, and I started using it. And you know what happens when you put fabric softener onto the clothes that you then put on your body? It makes them softer. It’s a perfectly-named product. I should’ve been using it this whole time. Know what I blame? I blame the marketing. They’re marketing this product wrong. You got to get rid of that gay Snuggie Bear. He’s gay, right? Him and the Pillsbury Doughboy, they’re gay. They’re… They’re just out there touching tummies. You know what fabric softener needs? Know what mascot fabric softener needs? A sturdy lesbian. Just a sturdy lesbian on the cover being like, “It works, okay?” And I’m not used to a lot of the stuff that comes with relationships. He says very romantic and sweet things to me, you know. Like, he’ll say things like, “I could just look into your eyes forever.” “You have the most beautiful eyes.” Which, to be honest, made me feel okay about my body, you know? Like, “Just my eyes? Okay.” Uh… Then I do the very girly thing that we sometimes do. I’d be like, “Well, what happens when I get old and, uh…” “Like, my…” I hopefully age terribly, you know, and… “…you know, everything starts falling apart?” He’s like, “I don’t care. I could look into your eyes forever.” “They’re so beautiful. I absolutely love staring into your eyes.” Which is like a really sweet thing to say. But then I thought of one more question I wanted to ask him. But I didn’t ask it because there’s only one right answer, and I knew if he didn’t say the right answer, I’d have to leave. The question I wanted to ask was, “Okay, so what if someone plucked out my eyes… and I just had two sockets?” “Then what would you do?” I didn’t ask that question ’cause there’s only one right answer. And the right answer is, “Walk away quietly.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\n‘Cause that’s the funniest way to leave a newly blind person, is… “Are you still there?” “I feel your energy.” And it is, you know, like… Oh, I should mention, the guy I’m in a relationship with, he’s a Black man, and the only reason I’m telling you that is so you know I’m a good person. Uh… It’s really relevant for the next couple jokes. They don’t work as well if he’s not Black. Uh… There was one night I got home, and he was asleep on the couch, and the TV was on. And I don’t know what he fell asleep to, but when I came in, there was a video playing about white privilege. I was like, “This is the most passive-aggressive thing I’ve ever seen.” Like, I’m the white woman in this relationship. I’m the passive-aggressive one. How are you supposed to… How dare you try to out-white-woman me? So I did the whitest-woman thing I could think of. I called the police. And now he’s dead, so… I’m kidding, we live in Spain. They don’t do that there. They just give you an olive and make you take a nap. But, you know, it’s been really great and… Actually, not just this relationship, but everything over the past couple years, it’s really taught me we should always lead with love and kindness. No matter what. The relationship you’re in, your friends, your family, strangers, especially strangers. We should always lead with love and kindness. And of course we’re gonna argue, of course we’re gonna disagree. And hopefully those arguments never get too bad, but no matter what happens, you should always try to be the first person. Always try to be the first person to say, “Why are you yelling?” ‘Cause if you say that, you’ve won. And that’s what it’s really all about.\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\nPart 2: All Struggles Matter + Me Too\\n[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nIt’s fine, I don’t really care.\\n\\n\\n\\n[laughter]\\nI always like being here in Philadelphia.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love coming to Madison. I love being back here.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI’ve been noticing lately that a lot of comedians have been using their time on stage to talk about their struggles, and how they identify. And I think that’s good for comedy.\\n[audience laughs]\\nUm… Guys, this is serious. So… [chuckles] Guys, I’m about to talk about my struggles. I thought, you know, I could use my platform, here, to talk about how I struggle and how I identify. You remember, like, 15 years ago, this commercial would come on that would be like, “Do you have the urge to move your legs at night?” “Do you get a creepy crawly feeling in your legs?” “You might have restless leg syndrome.” Well, it turns out, I have restless leg syndrome. And you know how I got diagnosed with restless leg syndrome? I listened to those symptoms, and then I go, “Yes, I have it.” There’s no cure. And it is. You get this, like, itchy kind of feeling in your legs at night. You feel like you have to move them. Which also, I mean… Even just to have this disease… Calling it a disease is a bit of a… stretch. It’s kind of like the white women of diseases. You know, where you’re like, “Is it a problem? I don’t…” Like, even to recognize that you have it, you have to have a lot of time to rest. I was just relaxing at home for hours… when my legs were like, “Move.” It’s either restless legs, or it’s, like, prediabetes. Like… It’s your body being like, “Take a lap.” [chuckles] And it’s hard. The more you talk about it, kind of like the more, like, unbelievable it actually sounds. Like, if there was a GoFundMe for restless leg syndrome and a cat who needed a wheelchair… I think that cat’s getting a wheelchair. We don’t even know if he has restless legs ’cause he doesn’t have any.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nOh, don’t be sad about a fake cat that I just made up. And, like, this is not a great thing to complain about in the best of times, but, like, we’re not in the best of times. You know? Like, we’re just out of pandemic. People can’t find baby formula, gas is like $90 an ounce. Meanwhile, I’m like, “Sometimes at night I have to wiggle my legs because of the itchys and the scratchys.” So, I guess what I’d like to do tonight is I’d like to come out as insufferable. [chuckling]\\n[woman cheers]\\n[man] Yeah!\\nI feel validated because this Black man just raised his glass to me. And weunderstand suffering. It has… It has… It has been a really hard time for white women. I mean, not literally. [chuckles] Like, a lot of people are coming out and talking about their struggles, and white women are really trying to be a part of that. It’s been kind of hard for us to do, you know? ‘Cause it’s hard to have, like, a struggle and a skin care routine. Like, things are hard. I did this joke the other night and a white lady screamed out. She goes, “You’re going the wrong way.” She’s really having a hard time. But I thought about it and I think, white women, I think I figured out what our struggle is. I think our struggle is hearing how hard it is for other people is really hard for us. Like… Like, we heard how hard it was for Black people, and we were devastated. We saw pictures of the destruction in Ukraine, and we needed a social media break. We heard about the crimes against humanity in Palestine, and we didn’t really get into that one ’cause that’s not one of the “in” crises. But in general, hearing how hard things are for other people has been really hard for us. So hard, we can barely make our own jewelry. [chuckles] And, like, we blame a lot of stuff on white men, you know, and women, you have done a lot of stuff. [chuckles] Like, don’t even get mad about it. You’ve been really terrible, but you’re really good at it. You know? Like, white men came over from Europe, annihilated a civilization, and then rebranded it as Thanksgiving. That’s, like, pretty impressive. You know, and we blame a lot of stuff on you guys, which is very funny to me because we act like we haven’t participated in it at all. And we have participated at the most fundamental of levels. We made you. [chuckles] We’re like the guy who made the atom bomb, and we’re like, “But don’t use it!” You’d think, we’ve spent all this time with white men, you would think we would have picked up some tips and tricks by now. You know. You guys have the blueprint. It’s like we haven’t learned anything. It’s like we spent our whole life with Michael Jordan and only walked away with a bad gambling habit. I think one of the reasons it’s been hard for us to get ahead is because white women, we want to… We don’t want to give up being the victim, you know? But we also want to be in charge. We want to be the head victim in charge. You know, we want to be the manager, but we also want to be able to ask for the manager. Like, “I need to speak to the manager!” “Oh no, that’s me, and I’m a bitch.” And we’re really good at being the victim, you know, we’re good at it. Like, we’re the bride of victims. No matter what’s happening to other people, we’re like, “No, no, it’s my day.” [chuckles] “And my dad’s kind of paying for the whole thing, so…” And sometimes I get a bit frustrated with white women because… By the way, this whole section is gonna be about you, white women, if you haven’t picked that up yet. So if you’re starting, you know, starting to take offense, don’t worry, just cross your arms. “This is not what I came here for.” Sometimes I feel like we’re waiting for things to be nice for us, you know? Because I’ve said it before, you know. White women, we are oppressed. Sexism definitely exists, you know. But white men, you guys were smart. You kept us comfortable. It was a very air-conditioned oppression. Like, you know, again, I don’t want to downplay what happens to women. You know. Like, obviously sexism exists. A lot of women get murdered and assaulted, um, by like, you know… Okay. So I looked up the statistics for this. Um… For the joke, not because I cared. [chuckles] But, of the women who get murdered, 91% of them get murdered by someone they know. 62% of that is by their husband. So not are we getting murdered, we’re getting murdered by the people who we love the most. You know, and then I heard about all these trans women getting murdered and assaulted. And all I could think of when I heard that was, “Welcome.” [chuckles lightly]\\n[audience chuckles, then exclaims]\\n“Jump on in, the water is terrible.” “And full of missing women.”\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nSome people will say, “No, statistically, more trans women are getting murdered.” I’m like, are they getting murdered ’cause they’re trans or are they getting murdered ’cause they’re not used to presenting as a woman? You know, like, I can understand if they’re getting murdered, someone’s murdering them, they’re like, “This is ’cause you’re trans.” [chuckling] By the way… Sorry, I’m… I’m stabbing the person. I just looked at myself doing that. I was like, it looks like… Okay, I’m not jerking the person off. It’s a very different situation. “This is ’cause you’re trans.” “It’s a fun surprise.” You know… Technically, maybe you could murder someone that way, I don’t know. Probably take a while. [chuckles dryly] “You’re almost out.” You know what I’m saying? I… No, this is a knife, and I’m stabbing. “This… This is ’cause you’re trans.” If that’s how they’re getting murdered, okay, yes. It’s because they’re trans. Or, you know, is it because they’re not used to presenting as women and they’re doing, you know, stuff they shouldn’t be doing, like… walking home at night. Like, you used to be a lion. Now you’re a gazelle. There’s different rules, bitch. Okay? You can’t do everything you used to be able to do. You can’t just hang around vans. Like, what… what happened? Did you speak up in a meeting? Or did you do the most dangerous thing of all? Did you marry the love of your life? So, I understand. I understand when women are unhappy with society. You know, it makes sense to me. But you’re unhappy with society, do something about it. You know, all I see is these white women Karening. And that’s really frustrating to me. First of all, Karening isn’t new. Karening’s been happening since the beginning of time. You guys just finally started recording it. Like, there’s literally, like, cave paintings of Karens. It’s just a woman who’s like, “You’re not supposed to have a fire here.” Karening frustrates me ’cause it’s such an ineffective use of your power. You know, like when white men are unhappy with society, they really do something about it. They really get in there. You know, they run for office, they change laws, they gerrymander, they get their hands dirty, you know? When we’re unhappy with society, we don’t do that. We just, like, knock over a display in Target. It’s so frustrating. I think sometimes we think that, like, you know, as individuals, we can’t create change. And you can. Just you, as an individual, you can create change. I see men do it all the time. Women, you can do it on your own. You know, like, um… Ted Kaczynski wasn’t happy with society, and you know what he did? He built a perfectly symmetrical cabin, he wrote a manifesto, and sure, he sent some bombs in the mail, which wasn’t a great idea. But you know what happened to him? Netflix made three documentaries… and everyone knows Ted Kaczynski is the Unabomber. I don’t even know a Karen’s real name. Y’all are just thrown under the umbrella of Karen. I want a white woman to do something where I know your full name. Be your own Ted Kaczynski.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\n[chuckles] And look, you know, like, I don’t always just like to present problems, you know? Sometimes it’s good to have solutions too. And so I think women, white women, I think at some point in your life, you should be in a serious relationship with a Black man. All of us white women, at some point in our life, a serious relationship with a Black man. Just… Yeah. Um… Maybe this guy. Uh… He’s sitting by himself. [chuckles] I need you to be in a serious relationship with a Black man, just so you can hear how stupid all of your complaints actually sound. Like if you both get home from a hard day and you’re like, “I literally had the worst day.” And he’s like, “Yeah, I had a bad day too.” And she’s like, “Well, what happened to you?” “Well, another Black man was shot in the back by the police, and it was actually a guy from my neighborhood and he wasn’t even running away.” “He was walking away, and this stuff just keeps happening, and it’s never going to change, and I’ve lost, like, all hope, and I’m just so angry.” “But what happened to you?” [softly] Uh… -Eh… –\\n[audience laughs]\\n“No, it’s not important.” “No, baby, in this house, we share.” “What happens to you happens to me.” Um… “Well, today at work, this guy called me a girl, and I’m a woman.” I can feel some women in here be like, “Well, she is.”\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[Michelle] I make fun of white women a lot. And the only reason I do it is because it’s fun and easy. But it’s not fair. You also deserve credit for some stuff, too, you know? Like, remember a couple of summers ago when we realized that Black Lives Matter? Waiting until a couple summers ago to realize things have been hard for Black people is like needing to see that documentary to know SeaWorld is bad. Like, did you know whales shouldn’t live in a sink?\\n[scattered clapping]\\nBut you know what we did? We realized things were hard, and white women really got out there. They protested, they advocated, you know, they really tried to do the work, but then something devastating happened to a lot of us white women. A lot of us white women realized we’re the ones who’ve been racist this whole time. We were shocked. We were so shocked, we pulled our purse closer. But even after that, we were like, “Wow, we didn’t even know we were like this.” “From now on, we’re going to learn.” “We’re going to listen, we’re going to hear, we’re going to open a small Black business.” “But most importantly, from now on, we’re going to do better.” “We want to do better.” And honestly, all jokes aside, that’s all we can do as a society. We can’t change the past. All we can do is better in the future. I genuinely think that’s the path forward for us.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nExcept… that’s almost exactly what men said after Me Too, and we found that answer completely unacceptable. Men were like, “Us? The whole time? We didn’t even know.” “From now on, we want to learn and listen and hear and open a small Black business.” “But most importantly, from now on, we want to do better.” “We’re going to do better.” And we were like, “No, not good enough.” “You all have to die.” “Every one of you. Doesn’t matter what you did.” “You could have raped somebody or accidentally whispered into a boob.” “It’s all the same.” “And you have to die.” Me Too was the worst-run movement I’ve ever seen. I was so frustrated by it because I think we genuinely could have made social change. We could have made things better for women and men, but we fucked it up from the very beginning. And I tried. I tried to get involved in Me Too. I didn’t want to get Me Too’d. Not how I wanted to get involved. I thought the more fun way to get involved would be to, like, Me Too men, you know? But that didn’t really work out. That just turned into three one-night stands. It’s really hard to Me Too a guy. You ever tried to Me Too a man? It’s very hard. You go up to a guy at work, you’re like, “Hey, nice ass.” He’ll be like, “Oh my God, no one has ever complimented my body.” “Most people call me smart and capable.” “But you made me feel pretty.” “And I touch your boobs.” It’s hard, you know? Everyone has different lines, you know? I don’t even think some men know where their line is. I think some men go so far past their line, when they finally turn around and see it, they’re like, “I have to go home.” And also, men, you like gross things. You do. You know this about yourselves. You like gross things. Like, I was in Thailand, and I went to one of those Ping-Pong shows.\\n[man exclaims]\\nIf you don’t know what they are, it’s not a game of Ping-Pong. I don’t know, it’s a little… A little bit a game of Ping-Pong. It’s these shows where women put Ping-Pongs and other things in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out at quite a velocity. I mean… these things really come at you. And it’s not just Ping-Pongs. One lady smoked out of her vagina. Another lady sucked up a little goldfish and then spit that guy back out. And it was still alive. Which I thought was very impressive. That’s like a solid pH that lady’s working with.\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[woman whoops]\\nOf course, the main event, they put Ping-Pongs in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out. And I’m telling… They really come at ya. This isn’t even a joke, they give you paddles to hit them away with. And you wanna hit them away. There’s probably some guys who are like, “Oh no, I missed.” [sniffs]\\n[audience exclaims]\\nOh, if the guy you’re with “Oh’d” too loud, he’s one of them. And I don’t know if this is just ’cause I’m like a competitive person, but as soon as I saw this, I started to wonder which of those things I could do. Every woman in this room, I think we all have the ability to smoke out of our vaginas. I think… I think we can all do that. I just wouldn’t do it if you’re pregnant, you know? You don’t want your baby to think he’s, like, too cool. You know? The fish one… The fish one, I would never try. I would never try the fish one because if the fish died, I would be mortified. I’d be like, “What? Too fishy for you?” The Ping-Pong one, that’s the one you want to know about yourself. Every woman in this room is asking herself the same question right now. Say it with me. “Can I shoot Ping-Pongs out of my vagina?”\\n[cheers and applause]\\nSo I tried, and now I’m just chock-full of Ping-Pongs. If anyone wants to play a game later, just drop-kick me in the stomach. Get some of those Ping-Pongs out, and hopefully that baby.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nYou gotta keep abortion jokes early in the set, you know? [chuckling] Before it’s a baby, so… The point is, the only reason I tell that story is because that show only exists because men, you like gross things. There’s no female version of that show. We’re not going anywhere to see men shoot anything out of their bodies. In fact, the one thing you do shoot out of your bodies, oftentimes we’re like, “Hey, can you wipe this off?” “I’m getting sticky.” That’s one of the reasons I think Me Too is confusing for men, ’cause there’s some weird gross Me Toos out there, but I think they’re all things men would have liked if it happened to them. Like if I went up to a guy at a party, and I was like, “Hey, I saw you from across the room and then I came into a bush.” I think if I said that to a guy at a party, he would be like, “Tell me more about that.” Coming into a bush at a party, that’s like a classic Harvey Weinstein, I don’t know, bit? [chuckles] He was kind of like the cornerstone of the whole Me Too movement. And rightfully so. He did a lot of terrible things. You know, and he was on trial. A lot of women testified against him. And this one woman testified, she goes, “Harvey offered me a role in exchange for sex.” “And when I said no, he goes, ‘Then you’ll never make it in Hollywood because that’s how a lot of women make it in Hollywood.'” And then, supposedly, he started naming names. He’s like, “That’s how Charlize Theron made it, Salma Hayek.” And that’s the part you never really think about. You know, for, like, all the bad Me Toos out there, there’s, like, a couple success ones.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nYeah, it makes this whole thing a lot grayer, doesn’t it? But you should not have to give a blowjob to get ahead. You should not have todo it. But you can. This is just about knowing your skill set. You know who’d be really mad to hear this information? Prostitutes. They’re like, “You got an Oscar? I got $50.” Personally, I don’t think I could ever do it, you know, just because the guys who offer it are all kind of gross, you know? They’re like the Harvey Weinsteins, the Roger Ailes. Like… I would talk about it. I’m a bit of a talker, you know. I’d be like, “Oh no, smells down here. Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.” [Michelle chuckling]\\n[scattered whooping]\\n[scattered clapping]\\nThis was a lot more complicated of a situation than we let it be. We needed to have conversations around it, and we couldn’t even have conversations. You were either Me Too or Me Against. There weren’t even levels. There should have been some levels. You know, like “Me Too.” “Me Kinda.” “Me Didn’t Know.” [chuckles] “Me Criminal.” [chuckles] And some stuff, some truly terrible stuff happened to women. And other stuff, I was like, “No, you just had a weird sex thing.” I heard one woman say this man put his penis on her forehead during sex, and she said that was a Me Too. I was like, “No you just had weird sex.” “That’s the day you found out if you like a penis on your forehead.” “And if you do, guess what. Me too.” So… “You got any ideas in there?” It’s fun, try it later. Uh… You know, ask. [chuckles softly] We needed to have conversations, you need to be able to ask questions, because everyone has a different line. You know, one woman’s line is another woman’s rope she likes to be tied up with. You’d hear a lot of women say, “Men shouldn’t use their power to have sex.” Other women would be like, “I like when men use their power to have sex.” And then men were like, “Can you tell us which one you are?” And we were like, “No,” but for different reasons. You hear some women be like, “This man, he hit on me at work, that’s harassment, it made me feel uncomfortable.” Like, “Okay, do you want no one to hit on you at work?” “No, I only want the men who I want to hit on me to hit on me at work.” “Okay. Do you want to make a list of who they are?” “No, I’m mysterious.” “Well, then buckle up, Nancy Drew, you got some uncomfortable times headed your way.” And I did… I genuinely saw men try to get better. You know? I saw men trying to listen to us and do better. Like, uh, I was in… riding in a car with a guy, and he asked to hold my hand. And I wasn’t used to that level of consent, you know? Like… I mean, I wasn’t used to rape, either. I’m more of a social-cues girl. And… But he asked to hold my hand. And I was so taken aback by it that my first reaction was, “Oh no! He must be sick or scared.” So I grabbed his hand, and I was like, “It’s going to be okay, buddy.” You know, relationships are complicated. Things between us are complicated, you know. And women, you know, we’re a little bit to blame for some of this stuff too. Like, uh, we’re attracted to the most dangerous type of man. You know, we like those big, strong guys. Tall guys with broad shoulders. You know how many times I’ve said “I want a big strong guy who can pick me up and throw me against the wall”? And then other women have definitely said, “He was big and strong, and then he threw me against the wall.” Same guy. Uh… And I say we’re partially responsible for that, because women, we’re at the point now where we decide who we marry, we decide who we mate with. We are attracted to those guys, so we marry them, we have kids with them, we make more of them. If we really wanted to make society better, we could just stop doing that. We could only marry… We could only marry short, soft-boned men. Get a whole generation of little Danny DeVitos running around. That’s actually why I think a lot of men don’t want to give women access to abortion. I think you know, deep down, that we could start deciding which of you gets to move ahead.\\n[whooping and clapping]\\n\\n\\n\\nWe could keep a whole database. We could be like, “No, no, not him. He doesn’t text back.” “Sorry, Kevin, the future’s for communicators.” We’re also, inexplicably… Women, we’re attracted to bad men. You know? Like, I don’t know why, but we’re just attracted to bad guys. Like, Charles Manson got wedding proposals in jail. Women heard what Charles Manson did, and they thought, “I’d like to be in a relationship with that man.” Even Charles Manson had to be like, “You wanna be in a relationship with me? That’s a red flag.” We’re, like, oddly attracted to serial killers. Anytime Netflix comes out with a new documentary about serial killers, we’re, like, attracted to them. It’s crazy to me, ’cause one, they’re serial killers, and two, it makes me think about how we don’t have many female serial killers. And the ones we do all kind of make sense, you know? They’re all prostitutes who killed their johns. And I can see how that could go south, you know? She’s probably like, “Where’s my Oscar?” [chuckles] But male serial killers, we know the same thing about all of you. Male serial killers all had terrible moms. But a lot of us women, we have terrible dads, and we don’t turn into serial killers. We just turn into people who have sex with other dads. It makes me so frustrated at women. I’m like, “Can you stop being a people-pleaser for five fucking minutes and get to murdering?”\\n[woman screams in laughter]\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\nYou know, be the change. You know? [chuckles]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\nPart 3: News to Me + All Beautiful\\n[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nIt’s fine, I don’t really care.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI always like being here in Philadelphia.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[cheering and clapping]\\nI love coming to Madison. I always love being back here.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI think a lot of times, women, we always feel like we have to, like, support other women, which… I don’t think we need to do that. Um…\\n[audience laughing]\\nLike, that’s, like, a lot to ask of a whole gender, you know? We don’t ask that of men, you know? Like, men aren’t like, “Men should support other men.” That’s not… They’re just like, “We’ll invade. It’s okay.” It’s totally fine not to like other… There’s plenty of women that I don’t like, you know? But sometimes I’ll find out information about them that will at least, like, let me understand them. Like, I saw an article about Nancy Reagan. First of all, I’ve never been a fan of Nancy Reagan. I always thought she was a tiny little cunt. You know? Yeah. That’s just my opinion. I don’t know. It’s not… But I saw an article about her recently that made me at least understand her. Uh, the article talked about how in Hollywood in the ’70s, Nancy Reagan was known as the throat GOAT. Yeah. Little old Nancy Reagan, in Hollywood in the ’70s, was known for the best at giving blow jobs. Do you know how hard it is to be the best at giving blow jobs in Hollywood in the ’70s? That’s how people auditioned. And she was the best. She was the Michael Jordan of blow jobs. Little old Nancy Reagan. But then, after I read that, her whole life made sense to me. It’s like, of course she hated gay men. They were her competition. She’s like, “We gotta keep AIDS around, my cheeks are getting tired.” [Michelle chuckles] You know, I saw that news story… I actually read that news story like I feel like a lot of us read news these days. Which is, I saw it, and I wanted to believe it was true, so then I just did. You know, like, I didn’t check sources or anything. Now that I’m thinking about it, I really wanna know what the sources are. It’s like a bunch of older men who are like… [mumbles] You know? You know she’s really good if that was the one thing Ronald Reagan remembered. “When Nancy puts me in her mouth…” “Hey, this is a Cabinet meeting, okay?” “Someone get him more jelly beans. We need…” [Michelle chuckles] But I think that’s what a lot of us do now when we look at the news, you know? We see something that kind of fits in line with what we want to believe, and then because we feel it’s true, it is. And that’s an incredibly dangerous place to be as a society. Plus, once something’s out there about you, it doesn’t actually matter if it’s true or not, people will just believe it. There’s some things out there about me that aren’t true, but I’m sure people believe it. Like, after I did the Correspondents’ Dinner, I got a lot of trolling. And, to be honest, most trolling, very boring. You know, it’s just repetitive. You know, a lot of it’s like, “You bitch, you cunt, you Carrot Top-looking motherfucker.” And that’s just me in the mirror, so… Well, how do you come? I got one really good troll after the Correspondents’ Dinner. I appreciated this troll. It was creative. He put in time and effort. It was really good. What he did was he took what looked like a screenshot of my actual hometown newspaper, the Hershey Chronicle, and so… I mean, the font was correct. A lot of information in the article was right. Like where I went to school, when I graduated, what I majored in. The meat of the article was incorrect. The headline read, “Wolf pleads guilty to bestiality.” Out of the box, though, right? You know? And I tried to find this article again, and I just, I Googled “Wolf bestiality.” I think I got a bit egotistical where I was just like… I was like, “Oh, wait, I need more words than that.” But that’s a fun rabbit hole if you want to go down that one. But the title of this article said, “Wolf pleads guilty to bestiality.” So now I find myself in the odd position to have to say things like, “No, I’ve never had sex with a dog.” But as soon as you have to say you’ve never had sex with a dog, it sounds like maybe you’ve had sex with a dog. By the way, that was the bestiality they were referring to. They said my bestiality was dog sex. If, when I said bestiality, you pictured a different animal, guess what, that’s the animal you would have sex with. And now you know that about yourself, so… That’s fun and exciting, you know? This article, now, all of a sudden, it makes me think of things that I never even wanted to think about before, like, “How do I have sex with a dog?? I’m a woman. How am I fucking a dog? So then I’d think about how I’d have sex with a dog. And I think the answer is you put peanut butter on your pussy. And now it sounds like I’ve maybe fucked a dog. By the way, if you ever do want to have sex with a dog, it said after I pleaded guilty that I only got 12 months probation and $1,100 fine. So, if that’s your thing, you might want to head over to Pennsylvania. It doesn’t sound like it’s gonna put you in that deep of a hole, you know? But we’re in Wisconsin. Maybe check the laws here. They might be better. [chuckles]\\n[audience exclaims]\\nThere’s a lot of farmland. There’s a lot of farmland. People get lonely. I get it. But, yeah, I’ve never had sex with a dog. But if I was going to, I’m not having sex with a rescue. [chuckles] I’m having sex with a purebred dog. A big, silky-coated dog. A dog who could really take care of me. And honestly, that would be fine if that was the only information out there about me. Um, it’s not. Do you guys remember Jeffrey Epstein, like, of the pedophiles? So, at some point, someone put a list of all the people who apparently went to Epstein’s island out. And it’s, like, a pretty good list. It’s got Barack Obama, Beyoncé, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks. Also on the list, me. Well, that’s not good. Now it looks like I fuck kids and dogs. It looks like I’m really going out of my way not to have sex with men. Which, if I was interested in both kids and dogs, a perfect combination of that is men.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd now I find myself in a position no one ever wants to be in, which is having to say the phrase, “No, I’ve never had sex with a kid.” I’ve never even been to that island. But by the way, if all those people are going, I’m gonna go. You probably don’t have to do anything there. You can probably just get a cocktail and see what Meryl Streep’s into. Which hopefully is role-play. You know? She’s a really good actress. I don’t know. So, I know, I had to say things like “I’ve never had sex with a kid.” And I haven’t. But if I was going to have sex with a kid, I wouldn’t go to some billionaire’s island to do it. I’d do it the normal way and become a teacher.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI know, we should pay them more. Get them supplies.\\n[upbeat music playing]\\nI hear all the time, women talk about how we should all be beautiful, how we should all feel beautiful. So it’s like, “We’re all beautiful.” “We’re all beautiful.” Well, first of all, that means we’re still valuing women on beauty. We’re like, “You have to be beautiful to be important, so we’ll just make sure every woman feels beautiful.” Which is maybe not the right metric. Also, a little problem with that plan, we’re not all beautiful. [chuckles] The only reason you know someone’s beautiful is ’cause you’ve seen someone who’s not. You’re like, “Yeah, that’s different… than that.” Like, recently, I was at the same event as Naomi Campbell, and people kept wanting us to take a picture together, and I was like, “No!” “I’m not gonna document how different humans can be.” “My skill set doesn’t come across in a photograph.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nNot too much, okay, guys. [chuckles] Also, but how dare you? How dare you want every woman to be beautiful? Don’t you think there’s women out there who knew they were ugly? They knew they were ugly, so they got good at something. They got respected for their abilities.\\n[cheering and applauding]\\nAnd then… And then some little bitch comes up to her, and she’s like, “You’re beautiful.” It’s like, “No, shut up.” “I got a horse face, and I’m an electrical engineer.” We gotta stop. We gotta stop with all this beautiful nonsense. We should even stop telling little girls they’re beautiful. I think as soon as they can understand us, you look that little girl right in the eye, and you go, “With a face like that, you get good at math.”\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\n“We’re all beautiful.” So much… So much of our existence is based off of beauty, and it’s such a waste of time. Like, Victoria’s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model. Don’t worry, this isn’t gonna be a joke about Down syndrome. You don’t have to draw a real hard line in the sand. Victoria’s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model and everyone was like, “This is such a great accomplishment for women.” And, don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that lady has a job. But, uh, can we stop acting like women posing with no clothes, or almost no clothes, is an accomplishment? It’s literally the least you could do. This is how little of an accomplishment it is. I couldn’t think of something it was like. I kept thinking, like, I don’t know, a baby learning how to use a spoon, and I was like, I don’t know, it’s still an accomplishment. It is literal… It’s the least you can do. There’s nothing impressive about it. It’s not moving the needle forward for women at all. We seem to have this idea that if every woman can pose nude, finally, we’ll get ahead. It’s not… It’s not doing anything for us, you know? It’s like, “We want equality,” and then someone was like, “How about every type of woman can be in a Dove commercial?” And we were like, “We’ll take it.” They were like, “Really? “This feels like a whole ‘beads for New York’ situation.” ‘Cause we’ve seen it. We’ve seen every type of woman. Every age, weight, race, number of arms, we’ve seen it all. There’s nothing impressive about it. You know? And we were the ones, women… We were the ones who needed to see it. You know, we saw what the standard model was, and we said, “I want that.” Men didn’t do this. Men didn’t put these ideas in our heads. Men saw every woman, and they’re like, “I’ll take that one.” “Yeah, that’s neat too. Okay.” “Line ’em up.” That’s what it feels like. It feels like we’re trying to get verification that a man will jerk off to anything. That’s how low the bar is for men. It’s like, “Oh, Chad, he’ll beat it to almost anything.” We’re like, “He’s an ally.” Also, like, women, you should want to be a little bit ugly. I promise, it’ll help you out. I get called ugly all the time. I don’t care, I have a skill. I don’t care. Also, I hope I age terribly. ‘Cause the uglier I get, the better this all works.\\n[audience applauding]\\nThe uglier I get, the more people I can make fun of. Like, I can’t do any accents or impressions. Okay? There’s one accent I can do, and it’s a very offensive Asian accent. Don’t ask me how I know, okay? I wanna get so ugly that I can do that accent and even Asian people will be like, “It’s okay.” And also, women, if you’re a little bit ugly, men are gonna be much more likely to believe you’re capable. And women too, by the way. Women are much… They’re also gonna believe you’re more capable if you’re a little bit ugly. If you have a bit of a busted face… and you’re like, “I’m a mathematician,” people will be like, “That tracks. Yeah.” Oh, don’t get sad about it, it’s true. You are the problem. [chuckles] “That’s sad, she thinks she’s ugly?” Who cares? She’s got a fucking job. Oh, this lady is so drunk, it doesn’t matter. Look at some of our most successful women. We don’t really think about these women because we never equate women’s success with, like, not being beautiful. But some of our most successful women, very ugly people. Some of these references are a little old. They’re just my personal favorites. Janet Reno.\\n[woman cheers]\\n[man] Reno!\\nJanet Reno was the first female attorney general. One of the longest-ever serving attorney generals. Worked for Democrats, Republicans, this lady was great at attorney general-ing.\\n[light clapping]\\nIf you can’t remember what Janet Reno looks like, she looked like what Larry Bird looks like now. For context, Will Ferrell played her on Saturday Night Live. And his costume was, like, a little bit of lipstick. Not a pretty lady. Everyone trusted her. [Michelle chuckles] Everyone’s favorite, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nYeah. Ugly little old bird. She actually looks like a bird’s foot. All, like, wrinkly and bony, and, like, a little bit… You know. Great Supreme Court Justice. Not a pretty lady. No one’s slinging dicks at Ruth. It’s just such… It’s such a waste of time. It’s a waste of all of our times and our talents. Then for a while, there was this group of women. They were the “I don’t care” women. And, honestly, that’s like the right lane to be in. But these women were pretending they didn’t care. They actually cared because they posted about how much they didn’t care on social media. They’re like, “I don’t care what you think, I’m confident.” “I don’t care, I’m confident.” Feels like you’re trying to “Beetlejuice” confidence. But these “I don’t care” women, they don’t wear makeup, work out, do their hair, they don’t care. If that’s what you want to do, that’s totally fine. But what are you doing? ‘Cause I know how much time all of that takes me. So, if you’re not doing that, what are you doing? Are you attorney general? Are you fluent in all the languages? How are you spending all of this extra time? Like, men have never really cared about how they’ve looked. But they have almost everything to show for it. They invented almost everything. They’re like, “So sorry I look like this, but here’s electricity.” “No, wait till it gets dark. This is gonna blow your mind.” “You’re gonna be able to stare in the mirror longer.” And the worst part is, these “I don’t care” women, they were getting grouped in with powerful women. Like, “Look at these ‘I don’t care’ women.” “Look at them, they’re such great examples.” No, you’re not a powerful woman, you’re a mediocre man. And if that’s what you want to be, that’s fine. Having openly mediocre women, I think that’s a big step forward. I think that’s really good for women. If you want to be mediocre, you do it. You lean into it. Have fun. Wear elastic. But know you’re mediocre. You know, don’t you go blaming stuff on sexism. If you don’t get a promotion, don’t be like, “That’s sexist.” It’s like, “No, you don’t know Excel.” It’s an intuitive program. But that’s the kind… That’s the kind of equality I want for women. I want true equality for women. I want women to be just as good as men, just as mediocre, and just as shitty. You know? I want us to be in charge of stuff. I’d love to see us leave our kids.\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I’d like to see a few serial killers. Good ones too. Like, good, creepy, dead-eyed, wear-your-skin serial killers.\\n[woman whooping]\\nThe kind Netflix makes a documentary about, and afterwards, people are like, “She’s cute, though.” [chuckles]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMichelle Wolf, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

We’re hung up on sexual orientation these days.\\nLike transgender, what do you think?\\nIt’s a tough one. Yeah.\\nIt’s a hot button issue. People get worked up.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the news, “Gender neutral bathrooms. Should be a man and a woman.”\\n“I don’t wanna shit next to trans person.”\\nWhoa, dude. I don’t wanna shit next to anybody, okay?\\nI’ve never thought about the type of person I’m shitting next to.\\nWho’s got time to decipher someone’s background when you gotta take a dump?\\nIf I get diarrhea at a restaurant, I run to the bathroom.\\nI’m not like, “Oh no, a Puerto Rican.”\\n“Agh!”\\n“I can’t take a BM next to a PR. What the hell?”\\nI agree there should be two bathrooms, not divided by gender.\\nI think you should divide it by pissing and shitting. Hmm.\\nI don’t care who I’m shitting next to as long as they’re also shitting, right?\\nBut if I walk into the shit room and see a trans person piss, I’m gonna go, “Hey, you’d better transition to a shit right now.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“You’re in the wrong room, sister.”\\n“Brother. Whatever.”\\nBut there’s a big debate these days.\\n“Are biological women the same as trans women?”\\n“Are the different? The same? Boopity boop.”\\nI think it’s like Coke and Pepsi.\\nAlways that one guy, “I love Coke, but I hate Pepsi.”\\n“All I got’s Pepsi.”\\n“I hate that shit.”\\nHand him a Pepsi, “Here’s a Coke.” He goes, “This is pretty good.”\\nI’m like, “Well, you just fucked a trans person.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[WHOOPING, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah, it’s all fluid, right?\\nThere’ll always be that guy who goes, “Some people have no gender.”\\nYeah, that’s Coke Zero. [CHUCKLES]\\nBut what the hell do I know?\\nI grew up in the ’90s. It was like, “I don’t see color.”\\n“We’re all the same. Treat everybody equally.”\\nNow, we’re obsessed with everyone’s differences.\\nYou flip through HBO Max, it’s all these categories.\\n“Trans Stories.”\\n“Strong Black Women.”\\n“Asian Culture.”\\nI know you’re trying to be progressive, but porn’s been doing this shit for 30 years.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou’re never gonna out-inclusive porn.\\nAll these networks patting themselves on the back.\\n“We have a gay section.”\\nPorn’s like, “We have a gay, senior citizen, dwarf in a wheelchair section.”\\n“You’re not more open-minded than us, right?”\\nTalk about representation.\\nI’ve been watching Asian culture since high school.\\nHBO’s like, “We have a family section.”\\nPorn’s like, “We got that and stepfamily. Come on.”\\nBut Chicago, gotta be said, beautiful women in this town.\\n\\n\\n\\nI mean…\\n[WHOOPING]\\nNone here. But, uh…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI’m joking. I’ll go down on you.\\nBut, you know…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nLadies, you look great. Beautiful.\\nDefinitely the better-looking gender, I think we all agree.\\nLike, ladies, you guys are even sexy on accident.\\nYou see a woman bend over or see down her shirt for a second.\\nYou’re like, “Whoa!” That’s a great moment.\\nYou see a guy in short shorts, something pops out.\\nYou’re like, “Oh, call the police.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah, the female form, it’s a work of art.\\nLadies, you look better the more skin you’re showing.\\nBikini, lingerie, mini skirt.\\nMen look better the more covered up we are.\\nBusiness suit, tuxedo, man in uniform.\\nI think a female strip club should be a guy coming out naked and slowly putting clothing on, you know?\\nSome lady’s like, “Whoo! Put on that blazer! Yeah!”\\nBy the end, she’s like, “Oh damn, he’s an astronaut.” [SIGHS]\\nLadies, you’re so hot, you touch your own body in bed.\\nYou’re on top like, “Oh yeah.”\\nNo guy wants to touch himself. No guy’s like, “All right, look at that.”\\nNo.\\n‘Cause I think you’re more turned on by men’s skills than our actual looks.\\nMen, we’re all visual.\\nWe go to a strip club, “Yeah, dance on that pole.”\\nAt a female strip club, it’s more like, “Yeah, install that pole.” Hey?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd you’re so mysterious. We have no idea what turns you on.\\nYou know everything that turns us on. We don’t know what you like.\\nI asked my wife, “What turns you on?” She goes, “I like a man who listens.”\\nI don’t know. I tuned out. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nEvery woman’s different. I asked a friend, “What turns you on?”\\nShe goes, “I like a man with intelligence.”\\nHow does that work in the bedroom? Some guy’s like, “Ah, hypotenuse.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI’m not a big strip club guy. I’m too awkward. I’m not cool.\\nSome guys are good at strip clubs.\\nGetting a lap dance, they’re like, “Yeah, bitch.”\\nOr whatever. I don’t know.\\nI’m too awkward.\\nI was in the back room once, getting a dance.\\nLady’s grinding me. She’s like, “What do you do?”\\nI’m like, “I’m a comedian.” She goes, “Tell me a joke.”\\nI was like, “Look, I’m not at work. You are.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nShe didn’t like that joke.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah.\\n[APPLAUSE CONTINUES]\\nBut hey, I’m doing all right.\\nI had sex with my wife today. Or, as she calls it, microdosing.\\nAnd, uh…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI remember when we got engaged.\\nShe was like, “You gotta post about the engagement.”\\nI was like, “Why? This is between us. Who cares about social media?”\\nShe’s like, “I want people to know.”\\n“Well, I want you to post about that threesome we had.”\\nShe’s like, “Why would I do that?” I’m like, “I want people to know.”\\nShe’s like, “Are you kidding? This is a bond between two people.”\\nI’m like, “This is better, it’s a bond between three.”\\nShe’s like, “I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a kid.”\\nI was like, “Ah…”\\nA lot of girls dream about a wedding. A lot of boys dream about a threesome.\\nAnd the dream is very similar.\\nWho we’ll invite, where we’ll do it, and we gotta get a photographer.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nShe’s a great egg, but I can always find a new way to piss her off.\\nTouched her stomach the other day, she flipped out.\\nShe’s got a nice stomach, just self-conscious about it.\\nPeople talk about private parts, like boobs are a private part.\\nI walk in a room, grab my girl’s boobs, she’s like, “Hey, how are ya?”\\nI grab her stomach, she’s like, “You wanna fucking die today?”\\nThat’s a private part, right?\\nIn the bedroom, she’ll cover it up so I can’t see it.\\nWhich I get, ’cause I feel the same way about my butt hole.\\nI don’t want anybody seeing that thing.\\nEven after wild sex, I still have to walk out of the room backwards.\\nThe stomach for a woman is the butt hole for a man.\\nThe condition of both is very dependent on diet.\\n[LAUGHTER, WHOOPING]\\nShe’ll be like, “I can’t hook up, I had a burrito.”\\nI’m like, “Same here.”\\nBut, like any couple, we fight. We got into it last week.\\nShe’s like, “I’m gonna level with you. I need more compliments.”\\nI was like, “Oh shit.” So I took her to a construction site. Oh.\\nBut it gets confusing.\\nWe were walking around and a homeless guy catcalled her.\\n“Nice ass, baby!”\\nI was like, “There you go, huh?”\\nShe’s like, “What are you gonna do about that guy?”\\n“I’m gonna go over and give that guy a couple of bucks.”\\nShe’s like, “I don’t want a compliment from him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m like, “A compliment’s a compliment.”\\nShe’s like, “I’ll take you to a gay bar, see how you like it.”\\nWe go to a gay bar, guys are all over me.\\n“What do you think about that?” I was like, “I fucking love it.” So…\\nSo that backfired, you know?\\nThe new fight is, I bought a vintage car. She hates this car.\\nShe goes, “I think you like the car more than you like me.”\\nIt’s not that I like it more, it’s just easier to understand.\\nLet’s be honest, ladies. You can be vague and secretive.\\nCar’s pretty cut and dry.\\nOut of gas? Empty. Overheated? Hot. There’s no game for the car.\\nThe engine of a car has never caught on fire and the dashboard says, “I’m fine.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nHmm.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah. I don’t know.\\n[WHISTLING]\\nMen compare women to cars all the time. Ladies, you’re the opposite of a car.\\nYour car is quiet, it’s running great. Girlfriend’s quiet, you’re in deep shit.\\nGirlfriends and cars have nothing in common.\\nExcept for the fact that my last one was stolen by a Black guy.\\n[GROANS]\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI think men are more like cars.\\nWe’re gassy, we’re fixer-uppers. We kill people sometimes, right?\\nAnd, ladies, if we stop working, you can just go electric.\\n[IMITATES BUZZING]\\nI think men are more like cars. Ladies, you’re more like horses.\\nBeautiful creatures, long legs, ponytail.\\nExpensive to feed, always need new shoes, we slap you on the ass, and once we see you take a shit, the magic’s over. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut we got some couples here tonight, huh?\\nThere you go. You guys swing?\\nNo. Um…\\nYou can tell you’re close with your lady when she starts farting around you.\\nI think that’s the true test.\\nAnd I get it, ladies. It’s a biological function.\\nBut can we keep it under ten a day? What do you think?\\nYou don’t want that to become your thing.\\nYou’re at a party. “Who ripped one?” “Classic Claire.”\\n[CHUCKLES] “Every time.”\\nFarting for a woman’s a tough look.\\nFarting for a woman is like crying for a man.\\nWe all pretend to be open-minded, but that shit’s a bummer, you know?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThe other day, I was going down on her. She farted, I started crying.\\nShe was like, “Aw, you need a tissue?”\\nI was like, “Do you?”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat about fart’s wacky cousin, queef?\\nYes.\\n[CHEERING]\\nLove a good queef.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nA lot of ladies get self-conscious, embarrassed.\\nI say queef it up, sister. It’s nice to see that thing talking for once.\\nLove a queef. Big fan of the queef.\\nI went down on a girl once, she queefed, my hair went… [EXHALES]\\nIt’s a hell of a time. You know what a queef’s like?\\nIt’s like when the subway goes by and you get that dirty air, you know?\\nSure, it’s not the most sanitary, but it’s hot down there, it’s refreshing, goddammit!\\nI’m pro-queef.\\nBut you gotta be empathetic to the queefs, fellas.\\nLadies, you’re more empathetic, more thoughtful.\\nYou think about others. Men don’t think about others.\\nWe think about ourselves, you know?\\nI go to dinner with my girl, she says, “Can’t eat here, the chef’s homophobic.”\\nI’m like, “Great, we’re not gay. We’re good.” Yeah?\\nThat’s how I think. Men don’t think about others.\\nI was watching tennis with my buddy. I go, “You know this guy hit his wife?”\\nMy friend goes, “Yeah, he’s got a great backhand.”\\nJesus Christ.\\nYou’re deeper, ladies. More emotionally intelligent.\\nAsk a woman what she likes in a guy, she’ll tell you what she likes because of how it makes her feel. “I like guys who are strong. I feel safe.”\\n“I like guys with money. I feel taken care of.”\\nGuys tell you what we like, not how we feel.\\n“What do you like in a woman?”\\n“A fat ass.”\\n“Hmm. How’s that make you feel?”\\n“Hard? I don’t know.”\\nGotta be tough to be a lady in a lot of ways.\\nSome perks, ladies, you know.\\nLike, you’re allowed to announce your standards in public.\\nWhen men announce their standards, we look shittier.\\nI was hanging out with some friends. We’re drinking. Talking about our type.\\nMy gay friend was like, “I like muscles on a man.”\\nAll right, gay guy, muscles.\\nMy lady friend, “I like a tall guy.” Yeah, women like tall guys.\\n“What do you like, Mark?” “Skinny girls with big tits.”\\nThey all went, “Oh, what a fucking asshole.”\\n“How come you’re allowed to shame me for what I’m attracted to?”\\n“You guys were shallow. Why can’t I be?”\\n“You like tall guys. I’m not a tall guy. I wasn’t like, ‘Classic whore.'”\\nI’d rather be taller but that’s my issue.\\nShe’s like, “It’s messed up you won’t sleep with certain women.”\\n“What about the gay guy? He won’t fuck any women. Yell at him.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou wanna be a good guy, it just gets confusing.\\nLadies, where are we at on objectifying women? Is that bad?\\nIt’s tough. Some women say, “Don’t ever objectify a woman.”\\nBut ladies, you do it all day long.\\nAny time a woman posts on Instagram, every girl’s like, “Beautiful.” “Stunning.” “Sexy.”\\nNever seen a woman write, “Smart.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHuh. Interesting.\\nLadies, you don’t like when men objectify women if they’re hot. But if they’re traditionally unattractive, you love it.\\nSmoking hot girl walks in. “Damn, she’s sexy as hell.”\\n“Easy, creep.”\\nIf a lady rolls in on a scooter with an eye patch, “Damn, she’s sexy as hell.”\\n“This is a great guy right here.”\\nIsn’t he still a creep? If you’re not threatened, you’re on board.\\nA guy puts up a poster in his cubicle, big breasted swimsuit models,\\n“Jeez, you pig.” “Oh no, they’re trans.”\\n“Hey, good for you.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut isn’t he still a pig?\\n“Is that a Victoria’s Secret poster?” “Yeah, it’s the one with Down’s syndrome.”\\n“Oh, carry on. Carry on.”\\n[GROANING]\\nLike, why does that make it okay?\\nHow about that, a Victoria’s Secret model with Down’s syndrome. That’s exciting.\\nYeah, she’s really pretty. I mean, I’d go downs on her.\\nYou know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGood for her. I support. I’m on board. I’m a fan.\\nI feel bad for the girl who didn’t get the job.\\n“Who got it?” “You don’t wanna know.”\\n“Kill yourself. Get out of town. Change career. Don’t tell anybody.”\\nBut I also understand, ladies.\\nYou’ve been held down by your looks for generations. That sucks.\\nMy brother’s got a cute little daughter. My mom got her a Barbie.\\nThe wife’s like, “No daughter of mine is playing with Barbie.”\\n“Why not?” “Barbie sets unrealistic body standards for girls.”\\nOf course Barbie’s unrealistic. That’s why kids like her.\\nNobody wants a realistic toy.\\nLike every man toy. Twelve-pack, huge arms, giant legs. They’re toys.\\n“She’s gonna think she has to look like her.” No, she’s not.\\nI’ve never heard of a girl with a Barbie, “Damn, guess I gotta cut off my nipples.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGirls aren’t stupid.\\nI get it. It’s a new day. Gotta be inclusive.\\nGotta have plus-size Barbie, Chinese Barbie, blind Barbie.\\nYou know who’s never changed? Ken. Huh.\\nKen’s a good-looking guy, full head of hair.\\nThere’s no bald Ken, drunk Ken, abusive Ken.\\nNobody wants a realistic Ken.\\nHe pulls up in the Dream Car, gets a DUI.\\nBarbie’s like, “I told you so.”\\nHe’s like, “Shut up, you fucking skank. I’ll kill you”\\nNobody wants that.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nYeah.\\n[CHEERING, WHISTLING]\\nIf you ask me, Ken is quietly the most inclusive, ’cause he’ll fuck any Barbie. He doesn’t give a shit.\\n“What is that? Wheelchair Barbie? Yeah, roll her over here, I don’t care.”\\nNow, that’s inclusive.\\nI would’ve killed for a Barbie growing up.\\nMy parents wouldn’t buy us any cool toys. They bought us board games. [GROANS]\\nEven the names of board games are a bummer.\\nSorry. Right?\\nTrouble. Operation.\\nAnd the saddest of all, Life.\\n[GROANS]\\nWhat kind of twisted, messed up game for a kid is Life?\\nLife’s hard, life sucks.\\nYou play games to escape life, not dive right in.\\nYou got a kid outdoors, playing with his friends.\\nYou drag him inside to play a game about mortgage and divorce?\\n[GROANS] That’s too real.\\n“Pick a card, Timmy. What’d you get?” “I got herpes.”\\n“It says you sent a tweet ten years ago that came back to haunt you.”\\n“You’re fired.”\\n“Man, life sucks.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHate a board game. Remember Clue? I hated Clue.\\nProfessor Plum in the study with the candlestick.\\nThat’s not relatable. Who’s dying from a candlestick?\\nYou gotta update that stuff. Make it stuff that kills people now.\\nPeanuts.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGender reveal party.\\nFentanyl. Cops.\\nUpdate it. Mark Normand in the hotel room under the BBW.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThat’s how I wanna go.\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah.\\nI did mention Fentanyl. We have an opioid crisis.\\n[MAN WHOOPS]\\nNobody seems to give a shit.\\nThat guy’s hopped up. Yeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah.\\nYeah. When I was a kid, all I heard was weed was the gateway drug.\\nRemember? “Weed is the gateway drug.”\\nI disagree. I think it’s cereal.\\nAll that sugar? Cereal’s getting kids high way younger than weed.\\nKids look like addicts when they wake up.\\n“Damn, I need a bowl.”\\nI mean, diabetes, obesity. We pump that shit into kids early.\\nThat’s why half the cereals are named after drugs.\\nSmacks. Right?\\nSpecial K. You know?\\nGolden Grahams. Already dealing in grams. I don’t know.\\nIf you go down the cereal aisle in Australia or Europe, it’s all health food. Heart healthy. Wholegrain. Fiber.\\nThe cereal aisle in America is like a fucking acid trip, right?\\nIt’s just bright colors and wacky cartoon characters.\\nEvery cereal mascot looks like a cracked-out addict, you know?\\nYou got a paranoid leprechaun and a jacked-up rabbit stealing shit from kids.\\nTony the Tiger’s clearly coked-up.\\n[STRAINED] “They’re great, yeah!”\\nHow about that wide-eyed toucan? “Hey, kids. Follow your nose.”\\n[CHUCKLES]\\nYeah.\\nI know fentanyl and opioid and all that stuff’s dark.\\nI like dark humor. Some people get upset. Everybody’s entitled to their opinion.\\nTo each his anal.\\nBut, you know. You’ve gotta admit, though, if we’re a society that gets upset about jokes, that’s a sign we got it pretty goddamn good, you know.\\nGuy in Ukraine’s getting his face shot. We got people here like, “Zingers, ugh.”\\nAlways blows my mind when somebody gets really upset about comedy.\\nI told a joke, this guy got pissed. He goes, “Apologize for that joke.”\\nI’m like, “Sorry?” He goes, “You didn’t mean that.”\\nI’m like, “I didn’t mean the joke either, you queef.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“What are we doing here?”\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nBut, you know, maybe it’s me.\\nMaybe it’s me. I’m too literal. Literal guy.\\nDefinitely hurt me in some social interactions, you know.\\nJust last week, I was at a party. Girl comes up to me.\\nShe goes, “Are you gay?” “Nah, I’m not gay.”\\nShe goes, “Whoa. Nothing wrong with being gay”\\nI’m like, “I know. Just saying I’m not.”\\n“You’re getting defensive.” “Well, I’m not gay.”\\n“There’s nothing wrong with it.” “I know, but I’m not.”\\nShe wouldn’t let it go. I got annoyed. I go, “Are you pregnant?”\\n“Screw you. I’m not pregnant.” “Nothing wrong with being pregnant.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut we made up eventually.\\nWe’re cool now, you know.\\nShe was like, “I should be honest.”\\n“I was pregnant for about three months in college.”\\nI was like, “Oh, that’s when I was gay.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut, you know, I’m an idiot.\\nBad socially.\\nI had a Tinder date ten years ago. Great date.\\nOne of those magical nights, everything clicked.\\nWent back to her place. Fooling around, naked, giggling.\\nShe goes, “Your Tinder pic, you look like a serial killer.”\\nI was like, “Damn, that’s not good.” Took the wind out of my sails.\\nShe goes, “What did you think of my pic?” “I thought you looked easy.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThat’s what she did. She flipped out. She went nuts.\\n“Why are you mad? Nothing wrong with being easy.”\\n“Serial killer? Way worse.” Right?\\n“You said I look like I murder people. I said you look fun.”\\n“Why are you mad? I should be mad at you.”\\nI didn’t get it. Then I realized, I’m not a serial killer.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nShe is easy.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nThat’s when I realized you can’t say what someone is to them.\\nThat’s mean. I learned that that night. You can’t say what someone is to them.\\nI’d never call a retarded person retarded. That’s just mean.\\nI’d call my friend retarded, ’cause he’s not retarded.\\nIf a friend spilled Pepsi on my laptop. “What are you doing, you retard?”\\nIf a retarded kid spilled Pepsi on my laptop, I’d be like, “Bubbles. Yay.”\\n‘Cause I’m not an asshole. I’m learning.\\n“By the way, I went on a date with a girl that looks easy.”\\n“You went on a date with a guy that looks like a killer.”\\n“What, are you fucking retarded?”\\n[LAUGHTER, CHEERING]\\nHmm.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nBut I didn’t mean to insult the lady, you know.\\n“You got a problem with easy women?” “I’m here. What are you talking about?”\\nI think it’s crazy.\\nIt’s 2023. We still make women feel bad for being promiscuous.\\nSluts are the best, right?\\nWhy make them feel bad?\\nThe best time to be a promiscuous woman was Native American times.\\nInca, Aztec, Mayan.\\nThey used to sacrifice virgins to the gods. Throw them in a volcano.\\nHoly shit. I’d be the biggest tramp on the reservation.\\nIt could save your life.\\nChief walks up. “Ma’am, crops are dying. We gotta sacrifice a virgin.”\\n“Are you a virgin?” “No, huge whore.”\\n“Huge whore.”\\n“You are way off, baby. Way off, all right?”\\n“I give the best arrowhead on this side of the wigwam, okay?”\\n“You don’t know what you’re dealing with. I put the ‘ho’ in Navajo out here, okay?”\\nYeah, you know my tribe name, Spread Eagle? That’s me.\\nYeah.\\nI think I like that system better.\\nReward the fun gals, get rid of the boring ones.\\nYou know there was some chief up on the volcano going, “You should’ve fucked me.”\\n“Whoa. Hey. All right. Shit. Look at that.”\\nNothing wrong with being promiscuous.\\nDon’t let anybody make you feel bad about that.\\nBut, ladies, you gotta own being sluts. Sometimes you slut-shame yourselves.\\nThat’s not gonna help the movement, huh?\\nYou have sex with a girl. You’re like, “I gotta go.”\\n“You’re gonna leave? I feel like a whore.”\\nIt’s like, “Yeah, you are.”\\n“And that’s okay.”\\n“I don’t want you to think I’m a slut.” “No, I knew.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThere’s nothing wrong with it, remember?\\nYou can’t tell people not to slut-shame and do it to yourself.\\nIt kills me when I see women trashing promiscuous women.\\n“How about Rachel? What a whore.” “What do you mean?”\\n“She fucks a new guy every weekend.” “So what? What do you do?”\\nEvery girl goes, “I get dinner and drinks out of him. Spend some money first.”\\n“Wait, you’re calling her a whore and you’re a prostitute.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nIsn’t that weirder? She’s banging guys she likes for free.\\nYou’re like, “How much lobster can I get with this clam?”\\nIsn’t that way whorier?\\nI don’t know.\\nWhat do I know? I’m a feminist.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nA lot of prostitutes walk around my neighborhood.\\nYou’re supposed to say sex worker now, but I’ve given enough money, I should be able to call them whatever I want. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nSex is just such a strange thing.\\nWe all have sex. We like sex. You guys have sex.\\nPlease, send me a video.\\nYou know, sex is fun. We like it.\\nIf you charge for it, all of a sudden there’s a stigma.\\nWeird. Sex is the only thing on earth that gets sadder when you go pro.\\nHuh.\\nNothing else is like that.\\nMaybe bowling.\\nHmm.\\n“My friend’s a great bowler.” “That’s cool.”\\n“My other friend’s a professional bowler.” “That’s a shame.”\\nEither way, bowling or prostitution, holes are getting fingered in an alley.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah.\\nYeah, I’ve been with a lot of promiscuous gals in my day.\\nPaid for a couple of big old aborshes.\\nThat’s a thing, you know.\\nOne time I left the abortion clinic with a lady and there’s a guy protesting.\\nHe goes, “You’re a goddamn murderer.”\\nI don’t know about murderer. I really more just hired a hitman.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHe’s like, “If it was up to me, you’d be in jail.”\\nIf I go to jail for this, I want murderer status.\\nI wanna look tough.\\nThe guys talking. “What are you in for?” “Grand theft auto.” “Assault.”\\nI’m like, “Murder.”\\nThey’re like, “Damn! Who’d you kill?”\\nI’m like, “Huh! A relative.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThey’re like, “Whoa, why’d you do that?” I’m like, “Caught him inside my girl.”\\n[CHUCKLES]\\nI miss that gal. She was fun, she was wild.\\nAfter the abortion, she was like, “We should celebrate with a drink.”\\nI was like, “I don’t think you should drink on an empty stomach.”\\n[LAUGHTER, GROANING]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nAh. All right.\\n[WHISTLING]\\nYeah.\\nBut, you know, it’s good you guys can come out for a yuk.\\nI know times are weird. The economy’s in the toilet.\\nGas prices are higher than Hunter Biden.\\nWho knows what’s going on out there, you know?\\nAll my friends are broke.\\nOne of my friends is broke but still buys the most crap.\\nHe just bought a Peloton.\\nYou ever see one of these things?\\nThree grand for this thing.\\nImagine explaining a Peloton to someone in a Third World country.\\nSome guy with no shoes on, on a dirt road, shabby clothes.\\n“Whoa, you spent $3,000 on a bike? Must be pretty fast.”\\n“Doesn’t move. Just sits in the living room.”\\n“In the living room? When you pedal, it generates power for your home?”\\n“No. Uses a lot of power. Got a big screen on the front.”\\n“Big screen? When you use it, you watch funny TV shows?”\\n“No, a better-looking person yells at you.”\\n“Oh. This thing sounds terrible. What’s the upside?”\\n“You eat too much takeout, you gotta burn some calories.”\\n“Whoa, whoa. What’s takeout?”\\n“That’s where a guy on a bicycle brings food to your house and you pay him.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“Wait. This guy’s got a real bike and you give him money? Why not do that?”\\n[SCOFFS] “What am I? A fucking immigrant? Come on.”\\nThat’s America. Yeah.\\nAny immigrants here tonight?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nHey, how are you? Where you from?\\nChina.\\n[MARK] China? All right. Sorry about the balloons. But, um, all right. Good one. Good to have you. Thank you. Just don’t cough.\\n[MAN] Ireland.\\nIreland? I was hoping for something browner.\\nAll right, okay.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThanks for being here. And you seem sober, which is shocking.\\nAll right.\\n[MAN] Pakistan.\\nPakistan? Hey, hopefully only one of us bombs.\\nI don’t even know if that’s a thing. Um…\\nMexicans? Are you Mexican, sir?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah, you’d look cute in a cage. All right.\\nSomebody check his papers, huh? All right.\\nSorry, that was a spicy one.\\nGood to have you. Sorry, sir. That joke was over the line.\\nAnd so are you. But, uh…\\nI’m jealous of immigrants, I really am. My buddy’s a Mexican immigrant. Been here eight years. He loves America. He never thinks about the bad parts. We got a lot of bad history. Slavery, Civil Rights, oppressing women, homophobia. He’s like, “I just got here.” [LAUGHS]\\nWhat a great position to be in.\\nAll the fun of America, not much of the hardship. It’s like becoming a firefighter on September 12th.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nImmigrants are great. Immigrants tend to appreciate America more than most Americans.\\nI’m from here, born and raised. I’m spoiled. I take it for granted. My grandparents are immigrants from Sicily. They never shut up. The American dream, the freedom, the opportunity. And I’m like, “Where the fuck’s my Uber Eats?” “Where the hell is that Pakistani with my food, goddammit?”\\nYeah. But I thought that was the big dream. You come to America, you make it big, you make a couple of bucks, you get rich. Boy, the rich thing is weird now. Feels like we hate rich people. Isn’t that weird? See that online a lot. “Fuck the rich, kill the rich, eat the rich.”\\nWhy are we all shitting on the thing we wanna be?\\nLike making fun of old people.\\n“Look at that old bastard. Probably shit his pants.”\\nYeah, that’s the goal.\\nWe’re all hypocrites.\\nWe all go to 7-Eleven, “Gimme that scratch-off.”\\nGuy goes by in a Ferrari. [IMITATES CAR]\\n“Rich prick. Come on, big money.”\\nWhich one is it? All of my friends are very left-leaning, liberal, “Down with hate, we gotta stop hate. But fuck rich people.”\\n“That feels pretty hateful.” “Well, I hate the 1%.”\\nLike, “Whoa, so you hate minorities?”\\nWe’re all so compassionate these days till someone’s doing better than you, then fuck them.\\nRich guy’s like, “My beach house burned down in Malibu.”\\n“Boo-fucking-hoo.”\\nHe’s like, “Well, my kids were in there.”\\n“I don’t get it. I invented something, now I don’t have feelings? Weird.”\\nAll these absolutes now. “Rich people are all evil.”\\nThat’s not how people work. They vary. Some are evil, some are nice.\\n“Cops are all bad.” No, some are bad, some are awesome.\\n“Teachers are heroes.” Some are heroes, some fuck their students.\\nRight?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd that student is a hero.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah. All right.\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nI don’t hate any group. I like all the groups, you know?\\nI also like racial jokes.\\nYeah, those kind of went away.\\nI grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood.\\nWe’d say horrible things to each other. Everybody got along.\\nYou can’t make those jokes anymore, and we seem more tense than ever.\\nIt was fun. Cut the tension, you know?\\nThey’d be like, “Mark, you can’t dance.” I was like, “Well, you can’t swim. Ah!”\\nWe’re still friends to this day.\\nThen some stiff white guy, “You can’t say that.”\\nYou don’t know our relationship. That’s what we do.\\nYou walk in on me choking my wife. “Call the police.” No, she loves that.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou don’t always know the relationship.\\nWe’re just so obsessed with race now, it’s always on my mind.\\nOn the phone with my insurance agent. “What color’s your car?”\\nI was like, “Jeez. I thought you were progressive.”\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nAnd, look, I’m a pretty progressive guy.\\nBut sometimes we get so progressive these days\\nwe actually end up kinda racist again.\\nI used to just have my friend. Now I’m very aware he’s my Black friend.\\n“Don’t say anything stupid. Don’t offend him.” That’s not progress.\\nI’m obsessed with his skin color now. Never thought about it before.\\nEverything I say, I’m second-guessing.\\n“You’re always banging your girlfriend. You’re like a sex slave.”\\nAh, shit. Ah.\\n“No, I’m just saying, you know, you’re whipped.”\\nAh, damn.\\n“No, I mean, you know, I just wanna hang.”\\n[GROANS]\\nHe’s like, “Screw this, I’m outta here.”\\n“All right, I’ll see you later.” Jesus Christ. Holy Hell.\\nThat’s not healthy.\\nHope no Jews are offended. We got any Jews here?\\n[WHOOPING, WHISTLING]\\nHey, all right!\\nGet ’em!\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nJust joking, Jews. Thanks for coming out. Love the tribe. And do something about this weather, will you?\\nYeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI love the Jews.\\nMy Jewish friends and my Black friends butt heads a lot over who had it worse.\\nThat’s a big argument. Slavery or the Holocaust?\\nGot heated one night, almost came to blows.\\nMy Black friend had to be like, “We’ve got stuff in common.”\\n“Let’s focus on that. We’re both oppressed.”\\n“Both contribute a lot to the arts, and our grandparents are both ashy.”\\n[LAUGHTER, GROANING]\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\nJust saying, Jews and Black people, a lot in common.\\nI go to my Black friend’s house, closet’s got a big pile of shoes.\\nGo to the Holocaust Museum, there’s a big pile of… You get it.\\nBut, no.\\nBig fan of the Jews. I hate to see the anti-Semitism bubbling up these days.\\nThat’s a bummer. Some people aren’t having it.\\nI heard one guy go, “These Jews are acting like babies.”\\n“These Jews are acting like babies.”\\nI disagree. I think Jews are tough, I think they’re resilient.\\nI do, however, think babies are acting like Jews.\\nYeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI was at a diner last week with my buddy. He’s Jewish.\\nA baby one table over. They were doing the same shit.\\nBoth wearing little hats, you know.\\nBaby’s uncomfortable, squirming. I look at my friend, he’s like, “My back.”\\nThe bill came, they both shit their pants and left.\\nBut, you know, I make jokes, but I try to be a good honky ally to my Black brethren.\\nAn awkward moment for a white guy is going to see a slave movie with your Black friend.\\nAwkward. Did that a few years back. Still haunts me.\\nHanging out with two Black guys. “We should see a movie.” “Hell, yeah.”\\n“We should go see 12 Years A Slave.” I was like, “Ah. I’ll get the tickets.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“It’s on me.”\\nWe had to see 12 Years A Slave in Harlem in the theater.\\nI’m the only white guy in there. I’m so uncomfortable, I’m shaking.\\nMy friend’s like, “What’s your problem?” “I want to leave, but I can’t.”\\nHe’s like, “Now you know how the slaves felt.”\\nGod damn.\\nHe’s like, “We did 400 years. You can do two hours.”\\nI was like, “Yes, Master.” [CHUCKLES]\\nAnd that is how I made slavery about me.\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nThat’s what white people do. Yeah.\\nBut I think we’re making progress.\\nWe’ve got a Black mermaid now. That’s big. Yeah.\\nCan’t have a Jewish mermaid, ’cause you guys can’t fuck with shellfish.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nWe’ve got a Black mermaid. They’re making more.\\nPixar’s doing a Rapunzel movie.\\n“Rapunzel, let down your hair.” Rapunzel’s gonna be Black.\\nWhich is cool. But the Prince is gonna be white.\\nGonna be awkward when he goes, “Rapunzel, let down your hair.”\\nAnd she’s gonna be like, “You’re not touching this shit.”\\nBut it is horrible when you see some real racism go down.\\nI was on the bus last week. Black guy tried to get on the bus.\\nDriver’s like, “We’re full, buddy.”\\nHe’s like, “I’m just trying to get on the bus.”\\nHe goes, “You’re treating me like this ’cause I’m Black.”\\nI’m like, man, that is messed up to treat someone differently ’cause they’re Black.\\nThen I realized, wait a minute, we all do that.\\nBlack guy says the n-word, no big deal.\\nWhite lady, you say the n-word, I get an erection.\\nYou know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut sometimes you should treat groups differently, you know?\\nIf my white friend’s getting wild, “Dude, you’re crazy. You’re an animal.”\\nIf my Black friend’s getting wild, I’m like, “Dude.”\\n“You’re crazy.” [CHUCKLES]\\nI’m way nicer to Black people than I am to white people.\\nI was at the gym, white guy playing his music really loud.\\nWe’re all like, “It’s a public space. It’s rude. Get the hell out of here.”\\nHe leaves. Twenty minutes later, a Black guy comes in.\\nHe starts playing his music really loud. We’re all like, “Good tunes, brother.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI had a guy go, “You do that ’cause you’re scared of Black people.”\\nI’m not scared of Black people. I’m scared of cell phone cameras.\\nThat is terrifying, you know?\\nAt a restaurant, a Black guy’s like, “I got you.”\\nLike, “Whoa. I said vinegar. Vinegar. What the hell?”\\n“Salt and vinegar.”\\nThat’s a dicey one.\\nI like a dicey zinger. Some people get weird.\\nYou know who doesn’t like dicey jokes? TV writers.\\nThey’ve turned down everything I ever pitched.\\nI pitched this great sitcom about the 9/11 terrorists, but of course, they shot down the pilot.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI know.\\nYou guys are fun. A lot of crowds are sensitive.\\nPeople are getting sensitive. My buddy is a vegan. Holy shit.\\nI’m walking on eggshells around him. He really hates that.\\nHe’s a great guy, but going out to eat with him is a nightmare.\\nHe’s got to have the Impossible Burger. You know about this?\\nLooks like meat, tastes like meat, feels like meat, but it’s not meat.\\nWeird. You hate something but want something just like it. Huh.\\nIt’s like a lesbian with a strap-on.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou hate dick, but it looks like a dick, feels like a dick.\\nI can’t believe it’s not dick.\\nIt’s beyond dick.\\nWe got any lesbians here tonight?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nHey, all right.\\nI think that was a guy. Uh…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nLesbians are underrepresented.\\nI travel the country doing comedy. I see gay bars everywhere.\\nThey always have funny names, like The Manhole or The Back Door.\\nWhere’s all the fun lesbian bars? Where’s Clitz, with a z?\\nClitz. Perfect name for a lesbian bar, ’cause no guy could find it.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd we’ll put it right in the hood. Aha.\\n[BELCHES]\\nAll right. Yeah.\\n[CHEERING]\\nComedy. All right.\\n[WHISTLING, APPLAUSE]\\nBut, hey, it’s good you guys are out now, ’cause you’re not watching the news. Too much news.\\nThe news is dark. It’s on 24/7.\\nThe news is more twisted than ever. Saw a news headline the other day.\\n“Transgender inmate impregnates female prisoner.”\\nI was like, “Wow.”\\n“Where is that porn?”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI’ve been watching porn my whole life, never saw a title that creative, right?\\nMan, the news is dark. The news is more fucked-up than porn now.\\nAnd it’s on everywhere. Every airport, bar, restaurant.\\nPut some porn on. I think we’d be in a better mood.\\nI was at the Amtrak station the other day. There was news on the wall, on TV.\\n“Man attacks multiple people on trains.”\\nJeez, I’m about to get on an Amtrak.\\nPut some porn on, that’d be better.\\nThen it’s, “Man runs a train on multiple people.”\\nAll right! Now I’m ready to board. Choo-choo. [LAUGHS]\\nThe news is crazy. Isn’t it weird we have two news channels in America that tell you two completely different news?\\nHow did that happen? Just tell me the news.\\nI don’t want your spin or bias.\\nThank God we don’t do that with the weather.\\nWouldn’t that be insane, if we had political, opinionated weather?\\nWe’re going to the beach tomorrow, let’s check the left-wing weather.\\nBoop.\\n“Hey, folks. 90 degrees outside. Beautiful day for an abortion.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“We got some dark clouds coming in. Excuse me, clouds of color.”\\n“And, as you can see, we’ve got tropical storm Kelly brewing.”\\n“Slowly transitions to Hurricane Kevin, but we don’t judge.”\\n“We’re not sure what the future holds, but it’s female. Back to you, they/them.”\\nHoly moly, I was just trying to get the goddamn weather.\\nThat was weird. I got nothing out of that. All right.\\nLet’s check the right-wing weather. Maybe that will be more informative.\\nBoop.\\n“Hey, folks. Grab your boots, it’s 100% chance of storming the Capitol.”\\n“Oh yeah. Gonna be a lot of hailing and heiling out there, and…”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“We got some ice in the Midwest.”\\n“We need some ICE at the border, I’ll tell you that right now.”\\n“Grab your coats, ’cause we hate snowflakes. Ooh!”\\n“Praise the Lord, and back to you, sugar tits.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nUh-huh.\\nAll right.\\nYeah, the news, it’s all politics now.\\nI’m so sick of politics. It’s the new sports team.\\nPeople make it their whole personality. It’s fricking exhausting. Yeah.\\nI look at politicians the same way I look at CBD gummies.\\nA lot of people believe in them, but I’m not sure they do anything.\\nThey don’t fix problems anymore, just change the name.\\n“We’re not in a recession, it’s a financial hiccup.”\\nWhat? We’re all broke.\\nThe banks are failing. What are you talking about?\\nThey do it with everything. “He’s not obese, he’s a person of size.”\\nWhat? He’s fat as shit.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“He’s not homeless, he’s unhoused.”\\nHe just diarrhea-d on my porch.\\nLike, who cares what we’re calling it. Let’s fix it.\\nHow long till bad guys start doing that? “I’m not racist, I’m ethnically choosy.”\\nHmm?\\n“I’m not a school shooter, I’m a student body minimizer.”\\nHuh?\\n[APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER]\\nAh, school shootings.\\nIt’s a problem.\\nIt’s a problem in this country. I was just in Canada.\\nThey’re nicer than us. They don’t shoot each other.\\nThey stab. Isn’t that nice? It’s kinda romantic.\\nWe shoot in America. More efficient.\\nShooting somebody is like breaking up via text. Easy, no mess.\\nStabbing is like breaking up in person.\\nYou see that look in their eye. “I know. This is hard for me too.”\\nGet back to your buddy, “How’d it go?” You’re like, “She fucking freaked out.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnother reason women are better than men, you don’t see a lot of female school shooters.\\nWhat’s going on there? I googled it, there’s been two.\\nHuh. Anybody ever heard of them?\\nIsn’t that weird? Whether it’s gun violence or the WNBA…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n…nobody’s watching these female shooters.\\nMan or woman.\\nGotta put up some more numbers, ladies.\\n[APPLAUSE]\\nI think I can solve school shootings.\\nI know people love guns. It’s America, people wanna buy a gun.\\nBut I think if a high-school kid buys a semiautomatic weapon, that should be a big deal. That should be public.\\nLet’s make that an event, like a wedding.\\nYou gotta send invitations, get your family to the gun shop.\\nThe shop owner, he’s like the priest.\\nHe holds up the gun, “If anyone has any objections, speak now, or this guy will forever own this piece.”\\nAnd we get some feedback.\\n“I’m his uncle. I don’t think he should have that gun ’cause he was molested.”\\n“I know that ’cause I did it.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“Probably a bad idea.”\\nI think half of these shooter kids are incel, virgin weirdos.\\nThey need to get laid, but it’s harder to get laid than it is to buy a gun.\\nYou can buy a gun at Walmart. You don’t wanna fuck anybody at Walmart.\\nThat’s why every gun shop should double as a whorehouse.\\nSlow these kids down a little bit, you know?\\nSome angry kid comes in, “I need an AR-15.”\\nWe’re like, “Whoa, whoa. How about a Brazilian 18?”\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah!\\n[CHEERING]\\nYeah. Then some kid has sex with her, goes back to school, he’s like, “What the fuck was I so angry about?”\\n“Holy hell. Life is good!”\\nSomeone’s like, “Are you smoking?” He’s like, “No, I’m paying a hooker.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAll right, thanks a lot. I’m Kevin Hart. You guys are great.\\nHave a good night. Comedy! Thank you.\\nQueef it up!\\nPraise Allah!\\nI’m gay!\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\n[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]\\n[WHISTLING, CHEERING]\\n[MUSIC CONTINUES]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMark Normand, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Denver!\\n[cheering and applause continues]\\n[Patton laughs] Oh my God! Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\n[cheering continues]\\nThank you. Oh my God! Yes! Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. Um… Hey, I broke my foot. Yeah. That’s how I started my year. I broke my foot. Uh… It was… It took two… It happened in two parts. Uh, the second part was I slipped off a curb and I landed wrong. That was the second part. The first and most important part was I turned 53. That is the crucial part.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI… You turn… Once you get past 50, everything’s fatal. I… When I was in my twenties, I would walk into propellers and put some Bactine on it. I was fine. And now if a pine cone falls near me, my spine implodes. I don’t know what… Like that. [audience laughs] Broke my foot, and then the day after… I’m gonna drop a name. All right. Uh, the day after I broke my foot, Glenn Howerton, my friend Glenn Howerton…\\n[audience cheers]\\n…who is almost 50, but for this bit he’s over 50. I needed to… Come on, who cares about logic? He broke his collarbone. So I called him up, gave him a little solidarity, a little support. “Hey, man. I broke my foot.” “What happened?” In my mind, I’m thinking, “Well, he was probably reaching for a bag of SunChips wrong, and his collarbone broke or something.” And he said, “Yeah, I was snowboarding. I landed a flip wrong.” All right. Fuck off. Fuck off.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou don’t need to go to that much hassle. Once you get to a certain age, you don’t need… I don’t even think that’s what happened. I think he’s lying to me. I think… I think somebody slammed a door near him, and then his collarbone fell into his ass cheek. And then he told his wife, “Duct-tape me to a snowboard and push me down a black diamond trail, please.” “Give me some dignity for God’s sake.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna drop another name. A month after I broke my foot, Tony Hawk broke his…\\n[audience cheering]\\n…broke his femur in two. Pow! Landed a vertical wrong. In his warehouse, doing his verticals, landed it wrong. Broke his femur. DMs me a picture of his X-ray. He’s like, “Looks like we’re in the same boat, buddy.” I’m like, “No, we’re fucking not.” You… [audience laughing] You just Jackie-Channed yourself into even more coolness. [audience laughs] He found a whole other level of cool. I slipped off a curb like someone’s aunt that saw a bird. That is how I went down.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI went down in the most embarrassing way possible. [audience chuckling] And the one weird thing that happened, ’cause when I did it I was still in my 23-year-old denial head of, “I just twisted my ankle. I’ll drive home.” I was at work. “I’ll drive home. I’ll be fine.” Driving home, it’s hurting worse. “Oh, this actually might be a real thing.” I get home. I can barely get out of the car now. And I’m limping across the street to my house. And it’s really hurting, and then a car pulls up, these two women are driving, and the driver rolls her window down and says, “You okay?” I’m like, “Oh, I twisted my ankle. I live right here.” “I’m going inside, put some ice on it.” And then, and this haunts me, she said, “Well, don’t give up.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhich… Wait. What? Holy shit! What was the look on my face? [audience laughing] What did I… Did she… “He’s gonna kill himself. Pull over. Pull over.” “Hey, don’t give up.” “Let me play this Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush song. This’ll really…” “Let’s listen to this.” Maybe that was just my face left over from the shutdown and the pandemic. Is that how my face permanently is now? Because I didn’t do the shutdown well at all. I did a bad shutdown. I planned a great shutdown. I planned an amazing… Remember when the shutdown happened? Supposed to stay home, and you had that little memory of all the times you said, “If I could just get a month off, I could get my shit together.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I could get my life… I just need a month off.” I planned a great shutdown. I executed the worst one ever. Oh my God, the list I made. The list we all made. We all made the same list? Yes, you did. All the great books you were gonna read. All the great books. All the skills you were gonna learn. Oh my God, we couldn’t wait to work on ourselves. If I had actually followed the list that I made, there’d be a different man standing in front of you right now. He’d be 30 pounds lighter. He’d be speaking fluent Italian.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhen all of you walked in, there would have been a handmade raspberry almond crumble tart on everyone’s chair, on each chair. I would have hand-milled the flour this morning. [audience laughing] You would have eaten it off of an origami plate. [audience laughs] When you’re done eating, you throw the plate down, it pops up into a frog. Oh my God! Oh, the plans I had! [audience laughing] I didn’t do any of that shit. I ate Doritos for breakfast, and I watched Deadwood twice all the way through. Watched it. Finished it. Back to episode one. Hit play.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat’s all I fucking did. And then I went crazier than a barn full of clown pubes. That is what I did during the shutdown. And listen, when I… When I say, “Crazier than a barn full of clown pubes…” [audience laughing] …I’m not kink-shaming. I’m not judging. [audience laughs] Clowns have as much right to have a varied and experimental, adventurous sex life. I’m saying the source of the crazy isn’t the clown pubes. It’s the having the thought and then the follow-through of “I’m gonna fill this barn…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…with the p…” I just want that to be clear. That the source of the crazy is the barn. The barn full of pubes isn’t even the crazy. It was the act of filling the barn… Listen, if you… If you just filled a barn with pubes, you’ve checked off the crazy box. [audience laughing] But this person went, “I’m putting obstructions in my way.” “I will only collect the pub…” Also, how do you… There’s no way to know. Clown pubes don’t look different. Like, they’re not bright orange. They’re not rainbow-colored. Look. Some are, but a lot… There’s a lot of… Listen. There… There’s a lot of non-clown pubes that are bright orange and rainbow-colored. That’s not what I’m saying here. What I’m saying is there’s no way that… Okay, this is what I’m saying. Wait. Fuck. Okay. If you… Like, okay, if you’re walking around…\\n[audience laughing]\\n…and there’s a barn, and you open those two big doors, there’s a wall of pubes, and you go, “Well, there’s a maniac roaming the countryside.” If someone said, “Those are only clown pubes.” Like, “Oh! We gotta call the National Guard.” Wait a minute. What? ‘Cause there’s no way to prove that. [audience laughing] Oh, okay, wait. You could do this. Every time… Every time that you collect… Not… Not a… Not a clump. That’s gross. Not a clump of… No. [audience laughing] Clump is too gross. Thatch? No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThatch is too folksy. That’s… That’s the other… Like, if Cracker Barrel opened a BDSM store, they would call it the Thatch of Pubes. That’s what it would be called. You’d go down to the Th… It’d probably be connected to the Cracker Barrel. You’d go in, get a nice breakfast, then go, “Hang on. I gotta pop into the Thatch of Pubes.” [audience laughs] “Pay the bill. I’ll meet you at the front.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThatch of Pu…\\n♪ Thatch of Pubes ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughing] We… ♪ We’ve got nipple clamps And scented lubes ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\nWe’ve got floggers, and paddles, and dildos. Oh my! And a tower of butt plugs that kisses the sky. [audience laughs] Tell ’em Petunia the pube pig sent ya. [audience laughs] Oink. All right. Um… [audience laughs] Handful. Handful of clown pubes. That’s non-gender specific. Every time you collect a handful of clown pubes, you take a Polaroid. You have a Polaroid, so you’re kneeling down. You’re collecting the pubes. You got your baggy. Gotta do it full length. Get the whole clown in there. He or she’s gotta be in their wig, their makeup, holding that day’s newspaper… [audience laughing] …so you know. Then you take a hole-punch, punch a hole through the Polaroid, get a ribbon, put it through that hole, tie the other end of the ribbon to the… the… the handful of pubes, toss it in the barn… Every handful of pubes is accounted for. There you go. And that’s how you would pro… Fuck, no. No, you can’t. You know why? No, that doesn’t work, because then someone can go, “Technically, you didn’t fill the barn with pubes because the ribbon and the Polaroid took up…” No, it has to be complete confidence in the speaker and total trust in the listener. When you say I tho… This is what’s happening right now, okay? We’re starting this set out. Let’s go on a journey for the next hour. I started off pretty strong, I think. I think I’ve won your trust, but you know what? You shouldn’t 100%… No. Not yet though.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBecause what you’ve got… Listen. What I’ve done, comedically, creatively, I have opened the barn doors. [audience laughing] And there’s a wall of pubes. [audience laughing] And yes, it’s impressive, but you’re right to go, “You know what?” “I bet that wall of pubes, I bet that’s a half an inch thick.” “And there’s a big sheet of plywood behind, and the rest of the barn is empty.” “I’ve been screwed over too many…” You’re right to think that. What I’m… This is what I’m doing. As a comedian, I’m inviting you… I’m saying I want you to run as hard as you can into this wall of pubes, and then, I want you to fight your way back, just fight your way to the back of the barn… [audience laughing] …until you’re cocooned in pubes. You know what I mean? At the back. And when your hand hits that back wall, you will think, “I met a man of honor.” That is what you will think. [audience laughing] That is what I want for us. Not me, not you, us. All of us. That’s what I want. Those are the kind of bits I wrote during the shutdown. I’d be awake for eight days in a row… [applause] Five in the morning, “The fucking Polaroid doesn’t even work!” Goddamn it! [audience cheering and applauding] I bought a trampoline.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot a giant backyard… One of those little workout ones. Yeah. Little tiny trampoline. It’s called a rebounder. Awesome. You get up on it. You hop up and down, get the lymphatic system going, “Here you go. Ooh. Out, in. Forward, back. Ski it out.” Great workout. Got it right at the beginning of the pandemic. “I’m gonna stay fit during this thing, man. I got my new rebounder.” It came out of the box, not a speck of dust on it. Oh, I was so excited. I could feel how excited the rebounder was. You could feel it. He was like, “I’m gonna make a difference in this house.” “I belong here. I’m gonna change things for the better.” I’m like, “That’s right, little rebounder. Wanna go inside the house?” “You wanna go in the gym?” He’s like, “Yeah.” We have a gym in our house. It’s a room with an elliptical in it. We call it a gym. [audience laughs] I take him inside. Oh, he’s so excited. I put him down. “I’ll see you tomorrow, little rebounder.” He goes, “Yeah.” We both looked over at the elliptical. [audience laughs] Against the wall. Clothes hanging off of it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nCovered in dust. And I could feel the rebounder’s heart break. I could feel his… You know what it felt like? It felt like the rookie cop fresh out of the academy. He’s like, “Give me the worst precinct in town. I’ll turn it around!” “I’ve got progressive policing techniques, community outreach.” “I’ll make a difference.” And he shows up that first day, big thermos of green tea, little keto lunch, he’s all excited. Looks over in the corner, “Who’s at his desk?” The old homicide cop. [audience laughs] Eight bullet holes in him. Eleven colostomy bags. [audience laughing] He’s having his seventh Viceroy of the morning. [audience laughing] [Patton exhales] That’s the elliptical. [audience laughing] Looks at the little rookie rebounder, “You’re gonna learn, kid.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You think I didn’t have dreams when I came here, huh?” “I was top of the line!” “You can stream movies on me, TV shows, mountain programs, everything!” “Oh! I was gonna turn this house of fatties around.” [audience laughing] “That guy that just dropped you off, he was on me day one.” “Cute little workout outfit.” “Little iPhone. He downloaded a bunch of podcasts on it.” “Ooh, a thinker!” [audience laughing] “He gets up on me, stretch those little fat thighs, pumping them up and down.” [grunting] “Thought he was gonna go the distance.” “He didn’t make it past the first Blue Apron ad.” [inhales, exhales] [audience laughing] “Hopped off of me.” “Went and checked his texts in the crapper.” [audience laughs] “He never came back.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Oh, he’ll be here tomorrow.” “Oh, he’ll be in his little workout outfit.” “He’ll probably put a little playlist on his iPhone.” “Yeah.” “He’s a Gen X-er in his fifties.” “I bet it’ll be all early ’80s New Wave pop.” [audience laughs] “That’s how he’s gonna get thin. Nostalgia.” [audience laughs] “He’ll hop up on you, start jumping up and down like a gibbon full of Skittles.” [audience laughs] “What’ll be the first song he listens to? I can call it right now.” “It’ll be the Go-Go’s ‘Our Lips Are Sealed.'” “That’ll be the first song.” “And you’ll be all excited. ‘Oh, he’s gonna go the full hour'”! “He won’t make it past the bridge.” [audience laughs] “The minute Jane Wiedlin starts singing, “Hush my darling,” he’ll hop off of you, he’ll check his texts in the crapper.” “He’ll never come back.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Extinguish all joy within you, and nothing’ll ever hurt you again.” [audience laughs] I just pitched the saddest Pixar movie in the… If they do a movie with the Safdie brothers, that’s gotta be their movie. Harvey Keitel is the elliptical. [audience laughing] Timothée Chalamet is the rebounder. [audience laughing] And Frances McDormand is the half-inflated exercise ball. [audience laughs] Went fucking crazy during the shutdown. My rock-bottom, psychologically, during the shutdown happened on the same day as my wife and daughter’s. We all hit crazy rock-bottom at the same time. Um, it was a weekday. We’re all in the house, staying inside. Doing our part. Stop the spread. My daughter’s in the kitchen, and out of nowhere, she says, “Hey, there’s a weird guy in our backyard.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat the fuck? I go running out, “What?” Looking out, “I don’t see anybody. You saw someone?” She goes, “Some weird guy just walked across our backyard and went around the back. He’s back there right now.” I’m like, “Oh shit!” We have cameras all over the property. I have an app on my phone. You click it and can look at what the camera sees. I’m waiting for it. I’m gonna go back and confront him. I just wanna know what I’m about to deal with. I don’t know what’s back there. What if it’s a lost hippie wanting someone to hacky-sack with him? “I’ll hacky-sack with you.” [audience laughing] Could be a maniac, nude, with a bucket of chicken on his dick, holding a sword. I don’t know what’s back… I just wanna be ready. [audience laughing] But the cameras aren’t loading, and I’m waiting for it. Goddamn it. And then my wife pushes past us, doesn’t say anything and goes striding across the back lawn. She’s got a white summer dress on flowing in the wind, barefoot. And she’s holding a pink, aluminum baseball bat. [audience laughing] And she has serious Manson girl energy coming off of her, like…\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Look at that hot, hippie chick that I wanna fuck and get murdered by.” “Yay.” [laughing] So, she… It takes me a second to realize what she’s doing, then I go clomping after her, in my flip-flops and cargo pants, but she’s already around the corner and she’s already laying into this guy. Before I can turn the corner, I hear her screaming at him, “Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my yard!” “I will fuck you up.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and applauding] So… I… I turned the corner. She’s in a stance. [audience laughs] Like Uma in Kill Bill, she’s ready to go. [audience laughs] The guy she’s yelling at, little scruffy looking, didn’t look crazy, didn’t look homeless, holding a cell phone, just looked a little off, and she’s screaming and yelling at him, “What the fuck are you doing here?” Now I’m gonna stop the story and tell you what was actually happening. There was something wrong with our air conditioner. I…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI called our contractor and said, “Can you send someone to the house to fix the AC?” Without telling us, he gave this guy our address and gate code and sent him to the house. So yes, massive misunderstanding. My wife is now screaming at him, and she’s just fucking… Just blazing Valkyrie, shrieking at the top of her lungs at this guy, “Who the fuck are you?” Now, to his discredit… [audience laughing] …when there is a blazing-eyed Valkyrie holding a vagina-colored piece of metal… [audience laughing] …threatening to kill you, answer in short, declarative sentences. [audience laughing] [applause] This guy… This guy was going, “Who’s anybody really, man? Like…” “Every day was… Oh, the wheel in the sky…” Oh, goddamn it. Now she’s got both hands on the bat. She’s gonna swing on the guy. And then he looks at me. And when he looks at me, that’s when he gets scared.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe started saying, “My name is Michael. Your guy Steve sent me here to figure…” And my wife’s like, “Oh my God, he didn’t tell us. I’m so sorry.” “Oh my God, I’m gonna call him right now.” “I’m… This was… This really got off on the wrong foot.” “How about you leave…” The guy was more than happy to leave. [audience laughs] I’m sure he was driving home going, “That poor bastard. Oh my God.” “I’m sure the sex is amazing but…” Um… [audience laughing] A lot of you hear the story and go, “That’s not very manly of you.” “You let your wife… God knows what could’ve happened!” I argue the opposite. [audience laughs] I say that our timing and placement made us a more effective home invasion deterrent. [audience laughs] ‘Cause remember he never got scared when she was screaming at him? He just kept going, “I…” You know why? He couldn’t process what he was seeing.\\n[audience laughs]\\nGorgeous Valkyrie, vagina-colored metal, screaming. Too much. Too fucking much. Couldn’t process it. And also, again, the energy she’s giving off is outer-space sex vixen about to murder you. [audience laughing] Can’t process it. You know what he could process? Me. Standing five feet behind her, ’cause the energy I was giving off was, “I can’t do nothing when she gets like this.” “I… I tried to get her to go to the nervous hospital, see?” “She said she’d burn the house down.” “She’s killed so many Amazon delivery drivers.” “I can’t dig no more holes in the desert. Please just run!” [audience laughing] I’m doing some poses that we can freeze for the Netflix save screen. A little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] [Patton chuckles]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThere’s gotta be… What if I did… What if I use… Here’s what I’m gonna do. Watch. Like this. [audience laughing and cheering] Now, look. That’s… That’s not a bit in the special, but if you’re watching Netflix, and that “coming up next,” you’re like, “Let’s watch a minute of that.” Like, “What the fuck is this?” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] I’m vaxxed and boosted. Yes, I am. Thank you. It shouldn’t… [cheering and applause] Thank you. But… That… Look. Thank you. It’s also sad that gets applause at this point, isn’t it? You get applause for taking the most basic care of your health? That’s like me going, “Folks, I wipe after I shit. Thank…” No. No, no. [cheering and applause] People. No. I’m no… I’m no hero now. It’s the lumberjacks who cut down the trees that make the toilet… Those are the heroes. [audience laughing] [man] Yeah! [chuckles] I assume there’s a lumberjack here. All right, um…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Patton chuckles] Or a really enthusiastic wiper. Um… [audience laughing] I got my vax right when the vax came out. Immediately. I didn’t jump the line. I didn’t use my privilege, but… I acted on some inside information, and I feel bad about this. This is how I did it. Uh… Right when the vaccine came out, I have a friend, lives out in Riverside. And he calls me and says, “I don’t know if I should tell you this, but, uh, out where I’m living, it’s MAGA country.” “No one is getting the vaccine.” “There’s a Rite Aid near me, a woman sitting at a table.” “Everyone that walks in she asks if they want it. No one will get it.” “They’re throwing crates of this shit out the back.” “If you drive out here, you will get a shot.” “Don’t even make an appointment.” So I drove out there. I walk in. There’s a woman at a table. I go, “Hi, excuse me. I’d like to get a vaccine.” She was like, “You would?” Like, she had no… [audience laughing] She had run out of Tolkien novels to read. Like, “Yeah. Let me get you set up.” Like, “Go stand over there.” While I’m waiting, my friend was right, everyone that walked in, “Would you like a vaccine?” “No, thank you.” And one guy gave her a, uh… “[scoffs] Yeah, no thanks.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nLike, “Yeah, nice try, Deep State. I think I’m gonna, uh…” “I think I’m gonna stay tracker-free for the time being if that’s all right.” “Hang on. Yeah. I’m at the Rite Aid again. Yeah.” “They tried to get a fucking track… Hang on. I’m losing you.” “There you are. Yeah, no. I’m off the grid, man. That’s…” “Right. I’ll call you later.” Got my shot. Got my second shot, then boosted twice. I’m fucking fine. In 1955, the polio vaccine came out. 1955. We were two years away from satellites. There were no satellites! And America could not have been more backward, racist, homophobic, sexist, and these non-satellite-having, racist dipshits lined the fuck up to get their fucking vaccine! [cheering and applause] What the fuck! [cheering and applause continues] “Give me that shot. I can’t police these water fountains from a wheelchair.” [audience laughing] “I can’t beat up queers inside an iron lung! Give me my science!” “What am I, a caveman?” [audience laughing] Now it’s the year 2022, which, first off, doesn’t sound like a real year, does it? [audience laughs] Doesn’t that sound made up? Like you’re watching a cheap science-fiction film, “In the year 2022…” “Oh, you’re just throwing numbers together. Jesus!” “Who wrote this shit?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s 2022. We have robots on Mars. They send us TikTok videos. [audience laughing] Half of the country’s like, “That needle’s got witch poison in it, I tells ya.” “You ain’t putting no witch poison in me.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “Keep your wizard jab away from me.” “I got to watch the video that the Mars robot sent to the world brain I keep it in my pocket.” [audience laughing] “But keep all that science away from me.” If that attitude had existed in 1955, the government would have had to do one of those PSAs, like a little cartoon dancing, hypodermic needle coming out, you know. [audience laughing] “Who do I gotta blow to cure polio?” Like little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] Yes. That’s right, jabby. Tell everyone about your benefits. [audience laughs] “My benefits? Your fucking legs work. How’s that for a benefit?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You medieval shitheads.” [audience laughing] It’s a different world now, man. It’s a different world. Isn’t it? Cruise ships? Oh, you’ll never see a cruise ship again. Kiss that goodbye. Our grandkids won’t know what a buffet is. Oh. [audience laughs] Fuck, Covid changed everything. First off, every cruise ship is booked up to the year 2026. People cannot wait to get aboard the plague barge and sail the bounding main. “Oh, let me die near a water slide!” [audience laughing] Not only are buffets gonna come back, they’re gonna come back with this weird, own-the-libs vengeance. Every one of them’s gonna have an agenda. “Come on down to Captain Covid’s Alpha Males Only buffet!” [audience laughing] “You the kind of left-wing soy boy that needs a sneeze guard over your clam chowder, or are you able to fuck your wife?” “Then come on down to Captain Covid’s…” [audience laughing] “You show us proof you ain’t been vaccinated, you get a free platter of room-temperature scallops.” [audience laughing] “That’s right.” [chuckles] Oh… I was listening to ’70s on 7 on the way here. Yeah, on my XM Sirius satellite dial. You like ’70s music? You hit number seven. All the ’70s music you can have, ’70s on 7. You like ’80s music? You hit number eight.\\n[audience laughs]\\n’80s on 8. Do you like ’90s music? Guess what you hit. Number nine! [audience laughing] Do you like ’40s music? Well, you don’t hit number four. You used to, ’40s on 4. Now, channel 71. ’40s Junction. You like ’50s music? Well, it’s channel 72. ’50s Gold. You like ’60s music? Seventy-three, ’60s Gold. Why did those three channels get moved to the outer rim of the XM Sirius universe? I will tell you why. Their listeners are dying. [audience laughing] ’40s, ’50s, ’60s. Those listeners are dropping like… The fucking ’40s channel has five listeners left. [audience laughing] Three World War II veterans and a couple of contrarian hipsters. That’s it. That’s all that’s left. “You know who’s punk rock? Artie Shaw.” Fuck off.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd we can laugh and enjoy it, but hey, during our lifetimes, ’70s, ’80s, ’90s will go marching up the dial. That’s how you can track how the generations are dying, by where they’re putting the stations. [audience laughing] Keep the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s easy. I hope when they do that, that they take a little time and give some consideration to the names the way they did for the ’40s channel, ’40s Junction, train station, evocative. I get it. Picture in my head. And then they just gave up. ’50s Gold, ’60s… Ah, who care… What? You couldn’t do “Poodle Skirts and Milkshakes”? You couldn’t do “Patchouli Oil and Love Beads,” or whatever? [audience laughing] Give the ’70s channel a name emblematic of the decade. You know, “Your Mother and I Are Separating Radio.” How about that? That’s good. Sure. [audience laughing] Yeah. “Giant Candles Everywhere For Some Reason Tunes.” [audience laughing] The ’80s could be “Trapper Keeper Tunes.” [audience cheering and applauding] And then the ’90s channel could just be… [groans] [audience laughing] [groaning] I don’t know… That was Abra Moore’s “Four-Leaf Clover” on… [groans]\\n[audience laughing]\\n[groans] [audience laughing] Hi. Do you live here in Denver, ma’am? I live in Colorado Springs. [Patton] You live in Colorado Springs? Nice. Thank you for making the drive. [woman] No problem. Okay. What do you… [laughing] Okay, glad I got that straight. It wasn’t a problem. Thank God. Okay. Guys, it wasn’t a problem. It’s cool. [audience laughing] [Patton chuckles] Do you work in Colorado Springs? What do you do? I’m a doctor. [Patton] You’re a doctor. Oh my God, a brainiac. All right, um… What kind of medicine do you practice? I’m a pediatric neurologist. Pediatric neurologist. Oh my God! [audience cheering] You’re like… [cheering and applause] You are serving your community. You are helping children. You have a positive job that you have a positive attitude towards. This is comedy death. I need to get off of you right now. There’s nothing here. [audience laughing] I need to talk to a meth cook or a divorcee. This is… [audience laughs] “I help children live.” [sliding beep] All right. Shit. [audience laughing] Is this, uh… Are you with her? You guys together? Is this the hubby? The husband. The husband. What do you do, sir? I’m a lawyer. [Patton] You’re a lawyer? Ah… [audience laughing] [kisses] Finally.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSome evil. [audience laughing and applauding] Oh God, if it’s some kind of positive community outreach law, I’m gonna fucking… What kind of law do you practice, sir? I prosecute juvenile sex crimes. You prosecute juvenile sex offenders. Well…\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhen you say juvenile sex offenders, do you mean people who commit sex offenses against juveniles, or juveniles who are sex offenders? Juveniles who are sex offenders. Juveniles who are sex offenders. Gotta be very careful with the phrasing. And when you say… And then what happens? Like, they get… Why am I…? What is this, a…? I gotta… Me sitting down was good for that one laugh. I’m not gonna do the rest of my show like, “So what do you do?” [audience laughing] What the hell am I doing?\\n[applause]\\nYou are prosecuting the juvenile sex offenders. Okay. And you are a neurological pediatrician. So a kid whose brain maybe isn’t working correctly, you help fix it. And the ones you can’t fix, he puts away, right? Is that how… [audience laughing] There we go. [audience laughing] There’s your next Marvel team-up. All right. So… [laughs]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat was cute and dark at the same time. Rare to find that. It’s like a goth girl holding a kitten. All right. [audience laughing] How about you? Do you live here in Denver?\\n[man] I do.\\nYou do? What do you do in Denver? Uh, I work in a bar and I’m a student. You work in a bar and you’re a student. Oh, it’s a 1980s Tom Hanks movie. All right. So…\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat are you studying right now? Uh, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. And then, by day, he patrols the Internet. At night, it’s Slippery Nipples for secretaries, right? [audience laughing] What, uh… So you’re a bartender, and so do you want to eventually work in cybersecurity? Obviously. [man] Yeah. And the bartending’s paying the bills. Paying for you to learn. What is the… What’s the scariest thing you’ve learned so far in terms of cybersecurity? How close are we to some huge hack attack where suddenly the ATMs don’t work and all of our porn searches are on the internet? When does that happen? [audience laughs] Um… Pretty much nothing is private. [Patton] Pretty much nothing is private. Well, we all know that at this point. That’s not… Oh my God, have you ever… Okay, when you were growing up, was there, like, some asshole that bullied you or was really shitty, and now that you’re learning your cybersecurity skills, you could go digging into this person’s life and just dis-fucking-mantle it if you wanted to?\\n[audience laughing]\\nHas that temptation ever crossed your head? Pretty frequently. Have you… Oh! Have you done searches of old bullies’ names and stuff like that? I’ve… I’ve chosen not to. You’ve chosen not to. [audience laughs] That is a very lawyerly response. That was… Did you catch that? [audience laughing] Oh, man. Is this the wife or girlfriend? Uh, yes. [Patton] Which one? [laughter] Girlfriend. [Patton] Girlfriend! Oh! And what do you do? I’m an educator. [Patton] You’re an educator. And what do you… Thank you. [cheering and applause] Wow. What, uh… What do you… What areas do you educate in? I help high schoolers, um, access free college credit. Help high schoolers access free college credit. Does the… That’s cool. Does the, um… Does the sleeve tattoo help break the ice when they’re like, “She’s cool”? “She’s all right.” Yep. That must help. [woman] It does, yeah. Do you go in with the sleeve tattoo visible? Or do they make you wear a long sleeve? I bust it all out. [Patton] You bust it all out, sit there… “Let’s get you some fucking credit while you look at The Gashlycrumb Tinies right there, man. There you go.” You got some ink too. How long you been going out? Three years. Four. Three or four years. Three or four years. [audience laughing] Mmm. Some cybersecurity, if you know what I’m saying. Ah, come on, people. Um…\\n[audience laughing]\\nAre you… Do you live together? Oh, nice! Are you gonna… She looks awesome in… And then he can get you, like, free credit card shit and everything. I mean, come on. [audience laughs] It’s a match made in heaven. Make it happen. Couldn’t he use his cybersecurity to get kids free college credit? Change their grades, get them into Harvard. There’s another fucking team-up. All right. [audience cheering and applauding] I have two superhero teams in the front row. Oh, hello sir. [audience laughing] Shorts in the front row. Ballsy. [audience laughing] That’s it. You have way more self-confidence than I will ever have. Do you live here in Denver? I do. [Patton] And what do you do in Denver? I work in Boulder, actually. You work in Boulder. Live in Denver, work in Boulder. What do you do in Boulder? I work for a grocery store. You work for a grocery store. With that facial hair? They’re cool with that or…? [laughter] What… I’m not gonna ask what grocery store. That’s weird. [man] I bet you can figure it out. Probably could. Hang on. What is your specific job at the grocery store? I’m a manager. You’re a manager at the grocery store. Do you manage the whole store or one department? Um… Yeah. [audience laughing] Yeah, part of it. Yeah. Part of it. The liquor section? What part do you, um…?\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou seem amazed at hearing that you’re working at a grocery store coming out of you. “I work at a grocery store! I…” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] And, uh, who are you here with? Is this your friend? There’s your friend. And where do you work? Uh, I work from home. You work from home. [man] In sales. In sales. I sell light bulbs. [Patton] You sell light bulbs. Are you asking me? You seem to be like, “I sell light…” You’re answering my questions like I’m a homicide cop. You’re like, “I-I sell light bulbs?” Like, it’s not… [audience laughing] You sell light bulbs from your home. I’m a lighting salesman. You’re a lighting salesman, so you stay in your house. You call people up or get on the internet with them? On the internet. On the internet. And you try to sell them light bulbs. Absolutely. Individuals or corporations? Both. [Patton] Both. That’s so fucking weird. [audience laughs] I just… I don’t know how… So you get on Zoom calls with them, and go, “Really quick, turn on all your lights.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“It’s pretty shitty, huh?” “Well, I’ve got a solution for you.” [laughing] [audience laughing] You’re not far. That’s so fucking interesting. Okay. You two are delightful, and you are not a superhero team. I’m sorry. [audience laughs] That is… I don’t know what the hell you are. There’s a guy who works at a Trader… Doesn’t quite know what he does there. Another guy gets on Zoom calls and sells light bulbs. I think you have a weird OnlyFans. You’re just covering for it now. You don’t really sell light bulbs. [man] It’s the DC Universe. Oh, DC Universe. Very… Oh… I’ll do the nerd shit, my friend. All right. [audience laughing] Don’t you dare! [audience laughing] That was a fun front row. Give them a round of applause. Thank you, guys. Wow. [cheering and applause] I love the flow of that. You know, doctor, lawyer, cybersecurity, educator, sort of groceries, light bulbs, I guess. I don’t know. [groans] [audience laughing] Perfectly paced. [kisses] [audience laughing] [sighs] You know what doesn’t age well? Woke. [audience laughs] It really doesn’t. I’m woke, I think. But you know what? I won’t be someday, and so will all of you.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBe woke. Be open-minded. Just don’t pat yourself on the back, ’cause it’ll bite you in the ass. Everyone getting cancelled now for not being woke was woke about something, they just couldn’t keep up with progress. Progress will always fucking steamroller you. I’m very pro-trans, very pro-gay marriage, gay rights, and pro-abor… No, no, no. No. No. [cheering and applause] That’s not… What I’m saying is that is going to blow up in my face someday. I’ll be doing comedy when I’m 70, and I will let slip something that I won’t be able to keep up with. I’ll be like, “I don’t think people should fuck their clones.” “Boo!” There’ll be some weird, like… [audience laughing] “No wait, I’m pro-trans.” “Fuck you, clone hater!” [audience laughing] “No, I’m totally progressive!” #Stopclonehate, then I gotta… Then I’ll double down. “When I grew up, you didn’t jerk off in a test tube and fuck whatever came out of it! If that makes me the bad guy, I’m sorry!”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Boo!” [Patton chuckles] By the way, that’s how you know if you’re a… uh, if you’re an oppressed minority, or, you know, a fringe group that used to be shit on, and now you know that you’ve made it when straight, white people start asking you if jokes are okay. That’s when you know… The trans community really broke through because all of a sudden, straight, white people’ll be like, “Is this okay?” “Does this joke work? Is that okay?” You know. But either way, that means in the future, straight, white people are gonna be the minority, then they’re gonna have assholes like, “Hey, I’m doing a joke about a straight, white dude, and, um, I have him bowling. Is that okay? You guys bowl, right? Like that’s…” [audience laughing] “It’s not offensive?” “He’s listening to Limp Bizkit, ‘ironically, ‘ okay?”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\n“It’s ironic. I’m doing it ironically.” [Patton chuckles] Goddamn, these last six years. Holy shit. I was in such a panic in 2016, then all the subsequent years, “What the hell’s going on? Oh my God. Is America coming to an end?” No. You know what? It isn’t. It’s bad right now, but everything that’s happening is supposed to be happening right now. Do you know what 2016 was? It was the boomers’ last temper tantrum.\\n[audience cheering]\\nThat’s what that was. [cheering and applause] The boomers’ last temper tantrum. Every time a generation gets old, they panic because death is scary and gross, and they put someone shitty in the White House before they go. This has happened before. The greatest generation… The greatest generation, oh my God, fought the Nazis, saved the world from tyranny, came back, built the suburbs, raised the baby boomers, then they started getting old. Hair turned gray, dick didn’t work anymore, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies. They panicked. Now it’s the late ’70s. Punk music, they don’t know what’s going on. “Fuck this.” “Put the old cowboy movie actor in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here, goddamn it!” [applause] Then the baby boomers grew up. Think of the baby boomers. They were on the cutting edge of sex, rock and roll, rebellion… They owned youth, and then they got fucking old. [audience laughing] And their hair got gray, and their dick stopped working, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies, fucking Gen X and Gen Z making fun of them on Twitter and TikTok. All this hip-hop music they don’t understand. Now they’re, “Oh my God, I’m about to die. What the fuck is going on?” “Put the racist game show host in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here!” [laughter and applause] I’m Gen X. Well, our temper tantrum is going to be beyond ugly. [audience laughing] When we start getting old, our dicks stop working, our hair goes gray, God knows who we’re gonna put in the White House. It’s gonna be either Eddie Vedder or Janeane Garofalo. One of those two. I don’t know. [cheering and applause] Look. I love those guys. Janeane would be a horrible president. [audience laughs] I’ve known her since the ’90s. I love her. She would tell you that herself. Janeane, you should be president. “I’m not doing that shit.” Oh my God, wait a minute. That’s how she’ll win. [audience laughs] Think of how Gen X thinks. Like, “That’s exactly the attitude we need.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect. “No, I’m serious. I’m not doing it.” Yeah, we know, yes. [audience laughing] She’ll blow off a debate. She won’t campaign. She won’t show up to her own inauguration. Yes, that’ll be awesome. We’ll love her even more. CNN will have a ticker on the bottom of the screen, like, “Day 312 of the president not showing up.” [audience laughing] It’ll cut to her in some coffee shop. “I told you I wasn’t gonna run.” [audience laughing] And then we’ll die, and we won’t be here to see what Gen Z puts in the White House. President Logan Paul. I don’t… Look. I don’t know. [audience groaning] President Joe Rogan. [audience groaning] He would… People, listen to me. I’ve also… I’ve known Joe since the ’90s. He is a sweet guy. He has gone off the rails. You know why? ‘Cause someone gave him a hundred million dollars. [audience laughs] That would drive anybody… He’s actually handling it better than I would. [audience laughs] If I had a fucking podcast about knitting and someone gave me a hundred million, I would fuck yarn on my podcast! [audience laughing] And Joe would be like, “Patton went fucking nuts. Oh my God.” [Patton chuckles] Aging isn’t bad if you don’t take it personally. That’s the key, you know. Treat it like it’s a… Pretend you’re Jeff Goldblum in The Fly, and you’re watching all this weird shit happen. You’re like, “Oh my!” Get a leather-bound notebook. Take notes, you know, late at night, like… “Oh. My farts smell like old books.” “That’s… Hmm.” [audience laughing] “But I’m not eating old books. This…” “This calls for further examination.” [audience laughing] “Day 17. Takes longer to stop peeing than it does to pee.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s coming for all of us. I’m gonna leave you with this story about my, uh… Another breakdown that I had. Foot, all of it, it’s all coming apart. But you know what? We’re living in the 21st century and it’s okay. Always keep that in mind. Last year, last November, I had to have some minor surgery, right? And I’m gonna tell you the story. I’m gonna use a little AP English zhoosh to keep it from being horrifying, ’cause it is. I had to have some minor surgery, the kind of surgery that, um, I’ll put it this way, men my age who sit down a lot have to have. See where I’m going? So… And I’m worried. Still Covid. “Oh my God, what if I get an infection?” But I forgot I live in the 21st century. I have all these advantages in the plus column. On the day of the operation, I summoned a car with my phone. The car came. The guy was masked. I was masked. Car was clean, took me to the hospital. Doctor met me, showed me all the cleanliness protocols they had. He said, “This surgery, we’ve refined it.” “It only takes an hour. You’ll be out for an hour.” “You’ll go home today.” He put me under. I wake up an hour later. Oh my God, I’m fine. He goes, “You are fine.” “Here are some cutting-edge painkillers to help you with your recovery.” “You won’t feel a thing.” “Now take out your phone and summon another car.” “You live in the 21st century.” And I did, and the car took me home. And when I got home, I had a device onto which I could call, from the air, movies, books, television shows, music to entertain me while I recovered. Twenty-first century. When I left the hospital, the doctor said, “There’s a certain bodily function, that you’re used to doing every day.” “And for the next few days, you’re not gonna do it.” [audience laughs] “And then, after three or four days, all of a sudden, you will do it.” [audience laughing] “But the first time you do it, it will be doing you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“There’s no shame in it.” “It’s gonna happen, part of the recovery.” “Go heal in peace.” I go home. First day, I watch movies. I read books on my iPad. I go to sleep. Nothing happens. Next day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. Nothing happens. Third day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. 3:30 in the morning. [audience laughing] It happens. But I wake up as it’s happening and I can feel it coming. I’m half a second ahead of it. Oh my goodness, it’s not gonna be a disaster. I hop out of bed. Everything’s okay. I make it across the bedroom floor. I get into the bathroom. I’m ten feet away from the toilet. I’m gonna make it. [sings suspenseful melody] Boom! No.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI had managed to get my underwear and sweatpants off. [audience laughing] Which made things ten times worse. [audience laughing] Because now, our pristine white-tile bathroom… [audience laughing] …was decorated for autumn. How about that, huh? Yeah. [audience laughing] Happy Thanksgiving. So… [audience laughing] I’m standing there going, “Oh my God, I’ve got two choices. I can either clean myself off, or risk my wife coming in and seeing this disaster, which she doesn’t deserve.” So, I do the second choice. I clean up everything first. I get a bunch of towels. I get everything all cleaned up in a big, gross wad. I gotta take off all my clothes, including my shirt. I’d ruined my shirt. [audience laughing] Physics. So…\\n[audience laughing]\\nTake the whole wad down to the… And I’m nude now. Go down to the kitchen with this big wad of horror, take the bag out of the can, put this in the bag. Now, four in the morning, I gotta walk to the end of my driveway where the trash cans are. Get the thing open. Drop it. And I just stand there. [audience laughing] Nude. [audience laughing] 4:00 in the morning. And I just looked at the moon. [audience laughing] Like, hours ago, I was in the 21st century… [audience laughing] …with access to cutting-edge technology, medicine, transportation. And now, just a mere couple of hours later, I had been revealed as the naked ape I always was.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[applause]\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThe naked, shit-covered ape that’s inside all of us. And I actually had a weird moment of peace, ’cause it was so awful, and I’m just like, “You know what? I’m actually as far away from the 21st century as I could possibly be right now.” “I’m actually closer to my Neanderthal forebears.” “There’s something weirdly cleansing about this.” And I had that feeling for, like, ten seconds. That’s when I remembered all my neighbors have ring cameras on their doors.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo everybody got their Christmas card that year.\\nThank you so much, Denver!\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThank you!

From childhood memories of watching Goodness Gracious Me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes, class, and multiculturalism in the UK, Shah blends humor and poignant storytelling. The show covers themes of identity, family sacrifice, love, and the generational impact of immigration, all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary.\\n* * *\\n[man] In January 1998, a seven-year-old boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London. Three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the BBC. Now, the boy’s grandparents had had tough lives, right? The sort of lives that clad you in an armour, and it’s the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape. But for the next half hour, the boy and his family watched episode one of Goodness Gracious Me, and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember. And watching Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal, Nina Wadia and Kulvinder Ghir on television, the boy thought, “Wait, we can do that?! I didn’t know we could do that.” “But if we get to do that, then I wanna do that,” because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Over 25 years later, would you please welcome to the stage Mr Ahir Shah.\\nHello! Hello!\\nHello. Hello. Hello. Hello.\\nGood evening, London. Are we well?\\n[cheering and applause] Fantastic, fantastic. Lovely to have you here. Lovely to have you in such fine voice. Hello! Uh, my name is Ahir Shah. That is my name, by the way, right? I didn’t used to need to clarify this, until a few years ago, I was doing this gig in Switzerland… I was doing a gig in Switzerland, and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country, right? I was the British entrant. Very modern.\\nRight? And…\\n[laughter] There was one comedian I was particularly excited to meet ’cause this guy’s name was Ali Al Sayed. Now, Ali is a stand-up comedian from the United Arab Emirates, of all places, right? I’d never met anyone from the United Arab Emirates, let alone a comedian from the United Arab Emirates. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t think they had comedians in the United Arab Emirates. I assumed he’d just be walking onstage being like, “What’s the deal with unspeakable oil wealth?”\\n[laughter]\\nHe’s a very nice man, a very funny man. After the show, all the comedians, we’re all backstage hanging out. We’re all having a laugh, having a drink. Not Ali, obviously. Right, and… We get to talking, and he says to me, “Like, uh, listen, bro.” “We’re friends now. I can ask you a question.” “You’re not gonna get offended.” I’m like, “Listen, brother.” “You’re from Dubai. I’m of South Asian origin.” “As long as the question you have for me is not, ‘Do you want a job on a construction site?'”\\n[laughter]\\nIndustrialised slavery. “You can ask me whatever the hell you like.” He’s like, “Nothing like that. I was just wondering.” “When did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name Ahir Shah?” Right? I was like, “To be honest, I don’t remember, but it was probably 28th December 1990 when I plopped out of Mrs Shah, and she and Mr Shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy Ahir.” “I think that’s about when I started going by Ahir Shah.” He’s like, “Right, right, okay.” “One thing you should know, in case you’re ever in my neck of the woods, is that in Arabic, your name means Prostitute King!”\\nHe wasn’t even fucking with me. Ahir Shah is “prostitute king” in Arabic. There are several reasons I didn’t think my career would go stratospheric in Saudi. Humble enough to know that I don’t have the best bone-saw material on the circuit. That’s Romesh, and fair enough. Right, but, uh… I put this to the back of my mind for several years, as you would, until, uh, November 2022. I was in Egypt doing some work around the COP climate conference. They speak Arabic in Egypt, and I don’t know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as “Monarch of all Pimps”?\\nReally changes the vibe in a lobby, in my experience. They think you’re selling something very different to what you are. Anyway, that’s me, then. Ahir Shah. Prostitute King to my friends. Mr Shah to you, and, uh… It’s been a while since I’ve done a big show like this. A lot’s changed in the world, in my life. A lot’s changed in my life. I’m now very much in my thirties now. That’s exciting. Shit started falling apart way younger than I was led to believe, by the way. I thought I had another good decade left in me. As it stands, everything’s already just crumbling. My knees are already fucked. Absolutely no idea what’s going on there. I’m trying desperately to get a referral from my GP, right… Sorry, for younger people… Right, um, a GP… Right… So a GP was a service where, like…\\nYoung fellow. How old are you, mate?\\nTwenty-two. Twenty-two. So you might remember but in the same way you remember iPods. You never had one, but you’re vaguely aware they existed. Okay, so basically, like, a GP was this, like… Right, imagine you’re a bit poorly. Not super poorly but a bit poorly. What would happen was there was this number you called, and someone answered, right, and, uh… Not even necessarily at eight in the morning. Any time during business hours. Very forthcoming. Uh, so you’d call them, and you’d be like, “Oh, I’m a bit poorly,” and they’d be like, “Ah, cool. Come see us, soon.”\\nRight? And so a couple of days, days, a couple of days later, what would happen was you went over to this… Right. It looked like a semi-detached house. It wasn’t. That was the first trick they played. It’s like a sphinx’s riddle. Past that, you were golden. You’d arrive, like, 10, 15 minutes early. You’re a conscientious person. And you’d sit in a sort of, uh, waiting room, and after about 10, 15 minutes, someone would call your name, and you’d go to a separate, smaller room, and there would just be one guy in there, and he would be like… I mean, he would, right? ‘Cause we’ve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard. Right? And you’d tell this person what sort of poorly that you were, and this was a very well-educated person, so you could just be fixed then and there, but occasionally, it’d be a slightly more complex health need, and you’d get a referral to a hospital, right? Sorry. Right. A hospital. Now… Have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends? Right? That is a building known as a “hospital”.\\nFunny word, isn’t it? Interesting thing. You were born in one. You’ll die in one. Between then, you’re fucked. Sorry. Right, uh, basically that… I’m obviously being slightly disingenuous. There are quite a lot of them. Generally speaking, they were all either built or done up when the prime minister’s name was either Attlee, Wilson, or Blair. Not sure why. Not sure why! It’s just a coincidence, isn’t it? What possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things? Fourteen fucking years! Fourteen wasted fucking years! Like, not entirely wasted, obviously. There have been some genuine achievements of Conservative government. I mean that entirely sincerely, by the way. My favourite of which is, like… Basically, it’s funny. If you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data, over the last 14 years, the Tories so successfully decarbonised the British economy and energy mix, including all imported emissions, that if the countries responsible for the lion’s share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as we’ve been over the last 14 years, global warming basically wouldn’t be a thing. The Tories did that. They did it on purpose. It is spectacularly impressive, and they can’t admit it ’cause they think it sounds gay. Other than that, it’s slim pickings out there. Really is. Genuinely. It’s worse than it’s been my entire adult life, for sure. Listen, the vibes are awful out there. We’re genuinely skint, as a collective, in a way that we weren’t in 2010 ’cause, basically, in 2010, the Conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the British economy and society. That they then spent the next 14 years ensuring were true. Right, and… Is it… We need an election, yeah. We need an election. At this stage, I would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of one-man dictatorial rule, provided that the man in question was Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, right?\\n[whooping and applause]\\nI love that guy! I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn much.\\nDo you sign up to his email?\\nOh yeah. You do? You’re a good citizen. Well done, sir. If you do not sign up for it, do your bit for your country. That man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink. Right. I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn… So, for the uninitiated, Martin Lewis, he’s a money-saving expert, and he runs this website called MoneySavingExpert.com, and you get a weekly email, and it’s about money saving and the expertise therein, right? And, um, basically, Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, he set up his business for £80, right? Eight-zero. That’s all it cost. He is now worth 100 million, right? Isn’t that amazing? He gives a lot away to things like Citizen’s Advice ’cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge. I love that for Martin Lewis. I love that Martin Lewis is rich. Right? Here’s the thing, right? The reason I love it is that Martin Lewis is basically the only person I can think of who’s got properly rich from helping. Do you know what I mean? Take a second to dwell on how rare that is, broadly speaking. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping, is there? We all know that. There’s money in hindering, for sure. Right? There’s no money in helping. Right? When’s the last time any of you were walking down the street and went, “Oh my god, a Lamborghini! Who does that belong to?” And someone’s like, “The lollipop lady.” Right? It doesn’t happen. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping unless you’re Martin Lewis. Because that man is rich as balls, and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like, “Pizza Express. 2 for 1 on Wednesday.” “Dough balls are on me. Don’t worry about it.”\\nIt’s gonna take more than Martin Lewis to save us now, the state that we’re in. It’s really bad out there. And it’s weird for me because at the same time as the country I love is so visibly on its knees, I am personally happier than I have ever been in my entire life. And the two things are entirely unconnected, but still, feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful. Do you know what I mean? I’ve not done it on purpose, but it’s like having Chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral. The reason, ladies and gentlemen, that I am happier than I have ever been is that in October of last year, I got married. Yeah. Honestly, she’s the single best thing ever to happen to me. I love her with all my heart. She’s a civil servant. I’m in it for the pension. You have to understand I’m a self-employed man. Before I met her, my retirement plan was just to not live that long. Whereas now, my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day I die. Right? That’ll be a new personal best, mate. In this economy, I’ll try anything, right? I’d always known that I wanted to get married eventually. I guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well. I don’t know what to tell you. In Asian families, you get married, you stay married. It’s just what happens. Some of you may know this from your own families, maybe friends’ families. You might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the case, so I’ll give you the best example I have. I started doing stand-up comedy when I was a teenager, right? When I was about 17 years old, I was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the Hackney Empire theatre in East London. That’s a very big theatre. 1500 people. Some of you may well have been. It’s the coolest thing that had ever happened to me. I was on in the first section, so I invited my mum, my dad and my sister to come watch, and they saved me a seat so I could watch in the second section. And the reason I was invited in the first place is that the Hackney Empire were putting on an evening of British Asian stand-up, and I, as the new kid on the block, they were like, “Let’s give little Ahir a go.”\\nThat’s nice, isn’t it? And so the whole audience, sold-out show, 1500 people, all British Asian. All of the performers, British Asian, apart from… right… about two hours before the show started, one of the acts suddenly had to drop out. Now, this is the noughties. It’s not like nowadays where everyone’s got email on their phones. They had to ring around, try and find a replacement. A replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian Joe Bor. Right? Now, Joe is a very nice man. He’s a very funny man. What Joe is not is a British Asian man. Right? What Joe is is a Jewish man. Clearly, with two hours on the clock, one of the organisers was like, “Fuck! I…” [muttering] “I think Jews are basically Asian. I…”\\nListen, I’m not saying there aren’t similarities between the communities. My best mate’s Jewish. We’ve been mates since we were 14 years old, and it’s ’cause the first time we met, he told me about his mum, and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadn’t thought of yet. There’s one crucial difference between the communities, as my friend the comedian Joe Bor found out to his dismay that evening. Because my friend the comedian Joe Bor walked onstage in front of 1500 brown faces and opened with the line, “My parents are divorced.” “Gimme a cheer if your parents are divorced.”\\nFucking nothing! Not a single sound from 1,500 people. I will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my 17-year-old ear, “Bless him. He has no idea who he’s talking to.”\\nSo what happens in Asian families, for better or for worse, you get married, you stay married. I come from a very long line of very long-married people. Uh, my parents met at a mutual friend’s birthday party in India in 1979. Fell in love at first sight. My dad proposed that night. They have been married for almost 45 years. Right? Um… By the standards of my mum’s family, by the way, my parents had had quite an extensive courtship, uh, prior to that. I mean, like, well, her parents, my maternal grandparents, Nanaji and Nanima, I mean, the first conversation they had with one another, just, like, one-on-one, was on the night, like, several hours after they were already married, right? It’s 1955 in India. It was arranged. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, they weren’t complete strangers to one another. That would be silly. It’s, like, the families had exchanged a photograph. Uh… Right? And, um… these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them. Imagine getting shown that when you’re, like, 19, 20.\\n“Is this who you’d like to marry forever?”\\n“Oh yeah, I guess.”\\nThen, in the end, very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young. It’s so funny talking about this in front of liberal London audiences. Like, it’s just like, you all know that outwardly you have to be like, “Oh.” “The mysteries of the East.” Uh… “A rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our own.”\\nInternally, you’re all just thinking, “That’s fucking barbaric.”\\n“The thing is, that’s fucking barbaric, sorry.” “You mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens, and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information, and within a matter of days, they were in bed together?” “That is fucking disgusting.” “We would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary, enlightened Western…”\\n[laughter and applause]\\nSorry, just because you’ve decided to do it via algorithm, not “old woman in your village”, does not make it less arranged, right? All you’ve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable, all right? My wife and I obviously had a far more conventional relationship, uh, prior to getting engaged, meeting in this country and whatnot. It took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question, as they say, mate. We were going out five weeks, and I asked her to marry me. Um… I get shit done. There’s no point pissing about if you know you know. So just get it… get it done. No point leaving stuff on your to-do list for six months. Things are worth doing quickly and well. It’s the single best decision I ever made. Absolutely no downside. Admittedly, we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because, like, our tenancy agreements didn’t… Spent half my life on a fucking bus. Then, eventually, obviously, we were able to finally move in together, but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in London joining households, so now, we rent one roof that contains two copies of every Ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownership. [chuckles] I love my Ottolenghi books though. Not giving those up, even for a house. Might need the spares. Love my Ottolenghi books. Hey, mate, you got an Ottolenghi book?\\nAh yeah, I love it.\\nYeah? That’s the sort of thing you can afford when you get the Martin Lewis email. Love my Ottolenghi books.\\n“For this recipe, you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a Persian widow.”\\n“Or, if they don’t have that in a shop near you, just any lime.”\\nThe thing is, you think it’s bullshit, but I got some of the widow limes, and you can taste the grief. It’s good stuff, actually. The salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour. I think that, shy of having children with someone, I think getting engaged, getting married, it’s like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on the future. Just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say, “Our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of them.”\\nThat’s an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel, right? At the same time as it feels like we’re embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime, it feels like the country around us has just given up. You know what I mean? It’s very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders, isn’t it? It is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country. Right? That’s weird enough for me as we’re beginning this optimistic journey, but it’s doubly weird when I think about the fact that if I were able to get into a time machine and travel to 1964, when my grandfather, younger than I am now, became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores, and I would just explain the present to him, he would not believe me because he would think I was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress. So that’s really what I’m trying to do. To take a step back, view things through a wider lens, a generational lens, get some perspective, not be so blinkered, try not to lose the wood for the trees. ‘Cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the British Indian community. I think that’s a very relevant story to the past, present and future of this country, right? British Indians are, by a very long margin, the largest minority-ethnic group in this country. Hindus, again we’re talking about millions upon millions… None of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate Nish. Right? And… The story of the Indian community in this country, by and large, starts, as it did for my family, in the 1960s and has ended up, in the 2020s, with us now running everything?\\n“Rishi bhai did it!”\\n“Rishi bhai did it! Never thought I’d live to see the day that Rishi bhai did it.”\\n“Got that big house in the middle of town now, baby.”\\n“Rishi bhai did it!”\\nListen, politically, I’m furious. Racially, thrilled. Ah! Are you kidding me? On an ethnic level, couldn’t be happier for him and his family. Increasingly worried about mine. Very much how I used to feel every time I saw Suella Aunty on the television. “Jesus Christ, calm down, Suella Aunty. You’re gonna get us both killed.”\\nRight, uh… I’m gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit. Obviously, I’ve got to be relatively careful what I say about him because we can all agree there’s about a 70% chance that a decade from now, I will play him in a Channel 4 drama. Right, right… Not gonna burn a bridge before I’ve even crossed it. Are you kidding me? I need that money. I just wish that I could get across, like, how wild that day was, right? I… A British Indian, devout Hindu, son of immigrants, became prime minister of Britain on Diwali. That was a very difficult day in the family WhatsApp for me. Get the family WhatsApp up on my phone. Yes, it’s called the Asian Network. See “Dad is typing…” Wait for the inevitable. “Ahir, have you seen what Mr Sunak’s son has done today?” “Still, Ahir, you enjoy mocking your week. I’m sure that’s nice for you.”\\nI’m glad the shine’s come off him now. Everyone knows he’s not really up to it. At the beginning, you all acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. At the beginning, everyone acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. It’s ’cause you just go off the CV on paper. Right? You don’t know what I know. What does it say on the CV? Fucking anyone could’ve done that. What? Piece of piss. Who cares? What? All right, fair enough. What’s the guy done? Fair enough. Does well at school. Gets into Oxford. Does well at Oxford. Gets into Stanford. Does well at Stanford. Starts working in finance. Becomes a multi-multimillionaire in his own right in his twenties, largely through executing positions as a big short in 2007-2008 that makes him rich enough that he’d never have to work again. No one even reflects on that ’cause at Stanford, he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine Indian billionaire, who’s a very successful businesswoman in her own right. They move to the United Kingdom where he becomes an MP at an obscenely young age, Chancellor at an obscenely young age, during one of the worst financial crises this country’s experienced, then prime minister, at an obscenely young age, of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors, leading to complex migratory patterns, in his family’s case, via East Africa, landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith, and everyone acts like he’s the perfect Indian boy. Feel free to look this up. It is genuinely true. Rishi Sunak never made his school cricket team. I was captain of mine.\\n[cheering and applause]\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s right! That is right! Any Indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me. All right? Know what I mean?\\n“Who cares about Rishi Sunak? I want Ahir Tendulkar. Mmm.”\\n“Hearing a lot about Number Ten. Should be batting at number four.”\\n“That’s classy.”\\nHis family came here in the ’60s too. Like, I… I think about that sometimes. Getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in Bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then, not only would this be the case, but I think the bit that he’d struggle with the most is that it’s not a thing. Do you know what I mean? The news was just like, “And the prime minister, Rishi Sunak,” and everyone’s like, “Yeah, that makes sense.”\\nIt is remarkable how unremarkable it is, right? That’s a thing that’s worth reflecting upon. Listen, I’ll always talk about the things we do badly as a country. I think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country. And I do think that when we’re at our best, Britain stands basically alone, certainly in Europe, probably in the world, as an example of what a properly successful multiethnic, multicultural democracy can look like in practice in the 21st century. That’s something that is worth discussing. It’s why I hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment, when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes. It’s why I can’t stand it when people on my own “team”, right? I don’t like teams in the first place, but listen. I voted remain, but whenever people are like, “It was only the European Union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency to…”\\nFuck off! Anyone else in the room ever been to continental Europe while not white? It’s not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy. Genuinely. A couple of years ago, I had to go to this wedding in France. I genuinely… The way people were… I kept asking people I was with… Like, I thought I had something on me. Turns out I did! Gonna get an Algerian president of France anytime soon, or reckon the fash’ll get there first? Same question for Germany, you know? Listen, I think that Britain stands basically alone in this. That’s worth reflecting on, right? I remember when I was 20 years old, walking across the Meadows on the south side of Edinburgh with my friend the Indian American comedian Hari Kondabolu, right? I said to him, “Hari bhai…“\\nI think that when you’re part of any sort of visible minority, whatever that minority might be, what you fundamentally want in life, it’s not necessarily different treatment or special treatment. Rather, it is the ability, eventually, to get to go without saying. To be part of what is. Just to, sort of, get to be normal. I think if you get to be normal 24-7, you probably don’t realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time. And does political representation get us there in and of itself? Of course it doesn’t, right? We know this for a fact. Rishi Sunak, not even the first PM from a minority-ethnic background. First, way back in the 19th century, Benjamin Disraeli, also a Tory, right? Would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary Britain? That would be a fucking stupid thing to say. But maybe these things are indicative of the fact that, in societies, we can, over time, move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying, until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone, which is where it should’ve been in the first fuckin’ place. I have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes. I have been to many countries, cities, continents doing this, and I can comfortably say that Britain is, yes, as the cliché goes, “the least racist country in the world”.\\nIt just says a shitload more about the world than about Britain. Right? And please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point. I think the guy’s a fucking appalling prime minister. He’s, like, genuinely terrible, and no one voted for any of this. It is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment. I do not agree with his politics, but… By the way, that’s when you know that something historic’s happened. People use phrases like, “I may not agree with the politics, but…” [emphatically] No one felt the need with David Cameron. It’s just nice for someone like that to get a girl, isn’t it? Right, but Sunak and Cameron are basically the same guy ’cause they went to fancy school. That’s what explains it. Fancy school, and fancy school runs the country. That is not the school that I think about when I think about the prime minister. The school that I think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away. In April 1919, an event occurred in Amritsar, Punjab, at the time British India, that is now known to history as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre. This is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians, peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very, very small area, and tens of thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians, at least 379 of whom were murdered, probably many more, though we’ll never know the true total, and thousands more had life-defining injuries thereafter. It is one of the worst and most well-documented cases of colonial atrocities of British rule in India. I’ve known about that a very long time. What I did not know about, until an investigation in The Times last year, was that subsequent to the massacre in Amritsar, there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding Amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings, including one that happened in a place called Gujranwala, right? Now, Gujranwala, it’s about 100 miles away from Amritsar. It’s a border town in contemporary Pakistan. And in Gujranwala, again, thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were let out at entirely unarmed… just farmers tilling their fields. And over the course of two days, ten bombs were dropped, including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of “This is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you, so don’t you even think about trying to fuck with us.”\\nOne of the survivors of the massacre in Gujranwala was a two-year-old boy named Ramdas. Ramdas’s grandson is, at time of recording, prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\nYeah.\\n[applause] When… when I think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations, I think about the school in Gujranwala rather more than I think about Winchester College. A punchline would feel distasteful.\\n[laughter]\\nRight? Obviously, I wasn’t alive at the time, but I reckon the way I feel’s basically how a lot of women felt about Margaret Thatcher in 1979. You don’t need to agree with someone’s politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself, and that’s the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow. And you can’t deny that it works. You can’t deny that it… Listen. We’ve now had enough white-lady prime ministers that they’re allowed to be instantly shit! That is a staggering achievement for equality in this country. Are you kidding me? Maggie and Theresa walked so Liz could fly. Liz Truss, actually very important from a representational standpoint as well. Uh, I mean that entirely sincerely too. Think about how many prime ministers there must’ve been over however long it’s been. Did you know that Liz Truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school? Isn’t that mad, right? Like, 94% of children go to a regular comprehensive school. I went to a regular comprehensive school. I believe 94% of prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school. Admittedly, she wasn’t a great advert for us. Right? “I may not agree with her politics, but…”\\nIn case you’re trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent you’re currently enjoying… Uh, well, uh… What ended up happening there was I went to my local comp in Wembley, North West London. I had a wonderful time there, but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other. Very thoughtful of them. Subsequent to that, I ended up going to the University of Cambridge, so I became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman. Uh, uh… A few years ago, I was doing a TV record in Glasgow, and afterwards, I was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian Jamali Maddix. I was there with Jamali, smoking, making small talk.\\nHe went, “You went private school, yeah?” I’m like, “Oh no, I didn’t.” “What?”\\nSo I talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood, and he just looked at me and went, “Hang on, bruv, are you from ends?”\\n[posher accent] “Well, Jamali, one supposes one was.”\\nI’m not gonna do it down. I grew up in a wonderful place. I went to a wonderful school. I hate when people do that down. I… genuinely, it was a really good school. If you avoided gang violence, cousin marriage, it was Ofsted Good. Like, it was a great environment. All the families, by and large like mine. First-, second-generation immigrants. Parents may not have had a lot to give. What they had was the most important. An insistence that education is the best way onward, upward, outward. I think if you’ve got 100 grand, that’s a better thing to give to a child. And blessed with really great teachers. I’ll tell you about one of my favourites, Miss Lewis. Now, Miss Lewis, I think she had previously taught at a private school. I don’t know, but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead. Maybe thought that was unfair, right? And so she set up, off her own initiative, like all great teachers do, off her own bat, she set up, for a couple of years, an additional, optional Latin class, of all things. And I, as you can probably imagine, was heavily involved. This is what I mean about the transformative power of education. You could change everything for young people in an instant. I still remember, like it was yesterday, the first time I walked into that gleaming Portakabin bestowed on us by New Labour, and I sat down, and I opened these textbooks that contained these things that I’d never even conceived of before. I was just there being like, “Oh my God, it’s true!” “Caecilius est in horto!”\\nDo you know what I mean, right? Led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school, which was one time, at the end of term, my boys and I were gonna go cinema ’cause you get a half day. The way that you go to the cinema, you get the 182 from Brent Town Hall. So we were walking to the bus stop, and on the way to the bus stop, there’s this blind alley, right? And a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit, until one of them just stopped all of the others by going, “Guys, Ahir’s safe, yeah? I know him from Latin.”\\nI sincerely believe I am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of Latin class. Uh… [chuckles] Nathaniel, gratias tibi. It’s a great environment to grow up in, you know? Not much cash but a lot of ambition. I think that’s a good way around to have it, generally speaking. And realistic ambition as well. The families just had realistic ambitions. The sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on. The idea that if everyone does their bit, works hard, the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did. That is a reasonable ambition. Parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children. Right, now this is not an unreasonable ambition. I know all about unreasonable ambition. You don’t need to tell me about… I remember once, when I was at uni, entirely unironically telling my mate Ali that by the time I was in my thirties, I wanted to be GQ magazine’s World’s Best Dressed Man. Right? I am now in my thirties and will settle for “Dressed Man”.\\n[chuckles] And that’s a stretch most days. Listen, we all know, fundamentally, that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment. I think that the part that we’ve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice. Now, I might not know much about generational investment yet, but I feel like, through example, I at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school, I would go to my grandparents’ house in Alperton, North West London, and I would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of Nanaji and Nanima. Now, quick note on language. I speak another language. It’s called Gujarati. “Nanaji” just means your mum’s dad. You have different words for both sides of the family. So maternal grandfather, that’s nanaji. As you can imagine, I write a lot of stuff on my computer. My computer refuses to accept the existence of the word “nanaji” and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word “Navajo”. Which has led to three instances where I, alone at home, have yelled at a computer screen, “Wrong sort of Indian!”\\nNow, Nanaji was the first member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties in 1964. He is probably the reason that I was born here in the first place. He is the reason for so much. Even though he died a fair while ago now, he’s probably the largest part of the reason why I ended up sounding like this, right? When he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country, he said to the children, including my mother, “Listen, when you’re outside, you’re not allowed to speak to one another in Gujarati any more.” “You live somewhere called England now, so you need to learn how to speak like proper little Englishmen and women.” “And then if you learn how to do that, maybe one day, they’ll learn how to accept you.”\\nAnd it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears, but this was a very commonplace thing in the ’60s and ’70s. A sort of, like, vocal version of dressing for the job you want. You ever heard that phrase, right? And this has been entirely useless for me, but, like, my uncle is a doctor. Can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me? You’d be fucking thrilled. Imagine that, he’s doing the ward rounds, just like, “Oh, good morning. How are we feeling today?” You’re thinking, “This motherfucker’s gonna cure me in two hours.” “Make lunch plans!”\\nNow, Nanaji could never integrate in that way himself, so I think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically English jobs, right? So for the most part of his career, until he retired, he worked at John Lewis. Worked on the shop floor, selling curtains, fabrics ’cause it’s what he knew from the textile factories back in India. That’s probably the most English place anyone could possibly work. You’re not gonna get a more English place to work than the John Lewis Partnership. Unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big, red bus! “Fair play. That’s the most English place anyone could possibly work.” “You can’t hit us with a more English workplace than the big, red bus.”\\nUnless the first job you had in this country was literally at the baked-bean factory! It’s where it all started. Baked-bean factory in Bradford. 1964, baby. Came over here. Work on those beans. Now, uh, crucially, he did not want to, uh, right? By that stage, been married for just under a decade. Had three children. Had friends. Enjoyed his work in the textile factory. Thought he might be able to work his way up and everything. Very little interest in the United Kingdom. Hitherto no interest in beans, right? But, um… It was my grandmother who pushed this. Like, Nani, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, just…” India at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of. And so she, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, these children aren’t gonna have the life we wanna give them over here, but they’re taking people in England.” “So I need you to go over there. You just work it out, right?” “I’ll stay here with the children. You send money back to us.” “When you’ve saved up enough, we’ll come join you.” “All right. Cool. See you later. Bye.”\\nUh… He just did it, like, pretty soon thereafter. Just went… Like, listen, I like to think that I’m gonna be a pretty, sort of, accepting, thoughtful, 50-50 type of husband, right? However, if, just under a decade from now, my wife is to tell me that I must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when I would see them again, no way of communicating with them, no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety, that would not be the end of the conversation. Right? However, of course, for Nanaji, it was. How could it not be? That’s your dharma. That’s your duty. You have to do it. It’s your duty to your family, right? So he came over, not entirely on his own. Came with a couple of other guys who did the same, left the wives and kids. But they didn’t really see each other that much for a few years ’cause they ran a system called the eight-eight-eight, right? The eight-eight-eight is a system whereby, as mathematicians in the room can confirm, if three men each have two jobs, the shifts of which are eight hours long, and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week, you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work. One guy finishes his second shift, comes back, hits you awake, you go off to your first one, he falls asleep. Do that again and again. Saves two-thirds on the rent. That’s more that you can send to the wives and kids in India. And that’s the largest expense, isn’t it? What’s the second-largest expense? Probably food. But food, taken care of. ‘Cause at the baked-bean factory, they give you a tin of beans. Protein. Very important. For the second meal of the day, they had a big sack of rice, and they’d have some boiled rice in a pot. Apart from Sundays, obviously, because Sunday is treat day, so the boiled rice contained an onion, right? Some of you are probably thinking, “Surely, even in 1964, onions are cheap.” “Anyone could have onions whenever they wanted.”\\nFrom what you have heard so far about my nanima, do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a seven-a-week onion habit? It’s what you needed to do. It’s what they needed you to do, so it’s what you did. Eight-eight-eight, 24-7, 365. Five. Five years. He didn’t see his wife or children for five years. Imagine that. It’s not like, “At least I’ve got a good data plan” or something like that. Forget about calling. That was never gonna happen. Letters? Couple of letters a year. Each time you write one, you feel a bit closer. Every time you buy a stamp, you’re driving them further away. To the extent that my mum’s first memory in this country is Heathrow Airport, 1969. Her, her brother and sister all sort of hid behind their mum because they were just like, “Who’s this man?” Right? “Who’s this big man?” Right? Just like, “Why’s he smiling at me?” “Why’s he got these tears in his eyes?” “I guess he looks like that photograph that Mummy cries over sometimes if anyone ever hums that song, you know?”\\nI think about that a lot too, right? Imagine that. Trying to raise three children on your own for five years, occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters. Should’ve cried over a lime. She’d have made some money. Family reunited in 1969, the year after a very prominent Conservative politician got on a soapbox in Birmingham and said, “We must be mad, literally mad, to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents, who are, for the most part, the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population.” “It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre.” Now, Mr Powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. Because that’s quite a mouthful, my sister and I tend to go with “Mum”.\\nImagine that. Bringing your wife and kids into that the year after Rivers of Blood, when you’ve been here on your own since ’64, the same year as the Smethwick campaign. Right? It’s fucking grim. Right, just like the violence, the aggression, that goes without saying. It’s also… It’s always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest, yeah? The thing, I suppose, like, nowadays, we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually, uh, accused of quite serious theft from the workplace, uh, which was, like… Suspended and investigated for ages. Entirely cleared. He’d obviously not done it. But it didn’t take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories, that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like, “Who do you reckon they’re gonna believe, eh?”\\nImagine what that does to you. Like, your dignity and stuff. You have to do it again though. Tomorrow. You have to get up, brave face, for the kids. For the kids. It’s not like the kids have it any easier. There has been so much more progress in the last 20 years in this country than there was in the 40 that preceded it, and I feel very comfortable saying that because I went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle. My abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when I didn’t get mugged ’cause of Latin. Ha-ha-ha. My uncle’s abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it. My mum’s abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something, she has to change her clothes entirely, cook, eat, change her clothes entirely again. No matter how many times I tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world, all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank. And he died in 2002, so he died only remembering the shit bit, and he wasn’t old, so if he’d just hung on, he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different. You could have at least seen a bit of that before you left. Right, in 2016, I’m on a train, reading a newspaper. Sorry, mate. A newspaper. Right, um… Imagine, like, a solid tweet. Right, and… and… On a train, reading a newspaper, and it’s the day before the mayoral election in London, and there’s this big feature article, uh, where basically Sadiq Uncle is walking around the city, meeting the various voters and talking to them. In the feature, there’s this one guy. I’ve forgotten his name. It was a West African name, I think. He’s there with his five-year-old son, and he says to him, “Son, I want you to shake this man’s hand.” “This is Mr Khan.” “Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London.”\\nAnd in that moment of reading that, like, my hands stopped working, and the paper fell from my hands, and the tears fell from my eyes as I thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London,” was completely impossible, right? And yet 14 years later, it had become totally inevitable. So what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper? What would he have made of reading a sentence like that? What would he have made of reading the words, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London”? Probably not much. I don’t think he really liked Muslims. “I may not agree with his politics, but…” And that’s how I felt Diwali before last, you know? Lit my divo, I went outside. I went back into the kitchen, and I poured a little glass of whisky, and I said, “You finding today interesting, eh?”\\nIt’s, like, obviously, problems still exist. None of this is to negate any of the problems that we’re all too aware of, right? But at the same time, pretending that the sort of stuff that I have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me. ‘Cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged, and it’s worth acknowledging. ‘Cause they’re the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible, right? I’m not an idiot. I wander around doing this for a living, all around the country. Occasionally, people shout ignorant shit at me in the street. Like, I’m not oblivious to that. And listen, my wife is a white Irish lady. Sometimes the two of us are going about our business, out and about, and people see us together. They don’t like that too much. They make their opinions known. They’re all so fuckin’ old, right? So old. Like, proper fossils, and… When I was a teenager, it would really… Like, I’d be ready to fight, and now a part of my brain just can’t help but think, “F… I think maybe you lost,” right? No, not… Lost isn’t correct ’cause it’s not like society’s a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the result’s been. But at the very least, I can acknowledge that I’m not the one who scored the goals. I’m a sub. They’re the ones who scored the goals. They scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line ’cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day, they were still, 1969, two down, right? And is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us? It’s worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is, right, because you see people, young people, trying, once again, to sow, sort of, any sorts of division in this society we’re trying to build. And you just think, “What the fuck are you doing?” “What are you doing?”\\nSurely, the point… If the point is anything, the point is to create a society in which, one day, everyone’s children get to go without saying. I think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that that’s possible, and I refuse to be anything else. It’s so easy to despair, right? Despair is the easiest position to have. It’s definitely my default. It just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion. Right? Try something else. Yeah? My wife’s way better than me at this. Like, she’s just, generally speaking, quite stable and well adjusted. I used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something. Turned out it’s because she has absolutely no social-media presence whatsoever. Uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work. If we were all slightly more like her, we’d all be slightly less fucking insane. By the way, no one’s changed their names. There’s no Mrs Shah to this story. Fortunately for all of us, in Irish, her name means “Prostitute Queen”.\\nDidn’t even take five weeks, not really. There was a point, one week, stood opposite her in the kitchen, and just all of a sudden, it’s like the trailers stopped. Like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers, and all of a sudden, every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison, “Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Shh.” [softly] “The picture’s about to start.” And now I get to see how it goes. That’s it. I mean, the ending’s gonna suck. Right. I’m not gonna know too much about it though. 100% gonna die first. Get in! Love it. Are you kidding me? Listen. It’s like… She’s really like, “Oh no, we shouldn’t have processed food in the house.” And all I want to do in my life is fuck a Chicago Town pizza. While chain-smoking and doing lines of salt. It’s nice to feel like you’ve had one of your last beginnings. Yeah? Frees you up to think about where things end up. It’s the interesting thing with love, right? Love, the way that it begins, begins in as many ways as there are people. If we were ever to have a conversation, and you said to me, “Ahir, can I just check, were you in love on your wedding day?”\\nWouldn’t that be a ridiculous question? You’d never ask. ‘Cause the answer’s obviously yes, right? What I find fascinating is that, if you were ever to meet my grandmother, and you were to say, “Ramila, can I check, on your wedding day, were you in love?”\\nIt would be an equally ridiculous question ’cause the answer would obviously be no. Of course she wasn’t. Right? There she was, little more than a girl, sat opposite little more than a boy. Total strangers, functionally. Of course she didn’t love that boy. Right? And yet it began. It began, right? Wild. Did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day? Of course she didn’t, right? Did she love the young man just under a decade later, who was willing to move continents because he knew that’s what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment? Of course she loved that man. She loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children, while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man in Heathrow Airport, 1969, the photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions. She loved that man as they danced together, shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible. For the next decades until his end, she loved that man. She loved that man in 2002 and well past that, as you will know if you go to a living room in Alperton, North West London, and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit. Of course she loves that man. That’s where it ends up. Nanaji died in 2002, a week after his birthday. He’d just turned 69. Oi! [chuckles softly] He’d brought a slightly hastened end onto himself, really, uh… Basically, when he retired, he wanted to spend as much time in India as humanly possible, but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties ’cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills. The place in India my family are historically from, a city called Ahmedabad, it’s incredibly polluted. Makes Central London look like the fucking Peak District. And so he would go over there and come back weaker, diminished. And he came back, and after the second trip, his grown-up children had to get him sat down in his own living room, and my mum had to say to her own dad, “You are killing yourself.” Right? “That’s what’s happening here. That’s what’s… It’s perfectly clear.”\\n“You go there. You come back. You’re weaker. You’re smaller.”\\n“You’re more diminished.”\\n“And can you not see what is happening to you?”\\n“It’s not even about seeing. Akshay is a doctor.”\\n“He can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose you.”\\n“Do you not feel what is happening?”\\n“So here’s the thing. You’ve had your fun. You’ve had two trips.”\\n“But now you stay over here, right?”\\n” ‘Cause we love you very much, so we wanna keep you around.”\\n“That’s how we’re all gonna look after one another.”\\n“So you’ve had your fun, but you’re not allowed to go any more.”\\n“Here you are. Good. Yes.”\\nAnd he had to look at three adult children and say, “No.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I never wanted any of this. Right, I never wanted any…”\\n“Like, my entire life, it turns out, has just been this means to an end, and that’s fine. It’s fine because you are the end.”\\n“So if I had to do it again, I would, with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face, I would do it again.”\\n“But can you not understand that I just need this at my end?”\\n“I can feel it far more than you can see it, or he can hear it.”\\n“Do you not understand I don’t care?”\\n“I don’t care because when I go over there, no one looks at me like I’m any different or yells at me or spits at me like I’m any different because I’m not any different.”\\n“When I go over there, I am a normal guy.”\\n“I have been a normal guy since the day I was born.”\\n“I just haven’t felt like it in so long.”\\n“You don’t understand that when I’m over there, I get to go without saying, and I haven’t gone without saying since nineteen sixty-fucking-four.”\\nHe used to run off the plane as quickly as possible, sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him, and go to the first part of the airport that wasn’t paved over, fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands. He would dig up the earth, and he would put it in his mouth. Can you imagine? Dig the earth and put… ‘Cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth. But you had to leave, you had to leave because that’s what they needed, and if they needed it, it’s what you had to do. He would dig the earth and put it in his mouth. It can’t have helped.\\n[laughter]\\nA third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying. And it killed him. That’s how much every human being wants that. You need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them. When he did die, he died in this country, in a hospital. D’you remember? “Hospital”.\\nAnd my mother was next to him, sat down. He was in a bed, not speaking any more. It was just the beeps, you know? Most of us have heard the beeps. And a nurse came by, saw my mum, and said, “Oh, you must be Mr Vaishnaw’s daughter.” She said, “Yes, I am.” And the nurse said, “Well, listen, I’m new to the ward, so I didn’t get a chance to speak to him, but I’ve spoken to some of the other nurses who did, and they said he was a good man.”\\nAnd my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in Heathrow Airport in 1969 and said, “He was the best of men.” And the line went flat. And if Nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment, then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men. And, like, objectively, he wasn’t.\\n[laughter]\\nDo you know what I mean? Not a baddie, but just, you know, a normal, complex, flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room. And probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for, I suppose. Yeah? But for someone, for someone, which it turns out is the only way that you can be, of course he was. He was the best of people for someone. He did what they needed from him when they needed it from him. He did the best that he could for the people he loved. If you can do that, then you can be the best of people for someone. If you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you, then you damn well get to go without saying, in my book. It is not that I have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement. The truth is what the truth always was in the first place, which is that the sacrifice is the achievement, and with that in mind, I know full well that till my end, Krishnadas Vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man I will ever meet. I have wanted to do this since January 1998, sat on the floor of my grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London, listening to Nanaji and Nanima laugh at episode one of Goodness Gracious Me. And for just over a decade, I have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career. But it’s not the job. Not any more. And it never will be again, I hope. The job, as I understand it, is what Nanaji understood the job to be. He was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be. He was the best of men. And I am now, in front of you, the World’s Best Dressed Man. [laughter and applause] Because I get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat. Because I am finally dressed for the job I want. And it will be the hardest job of a lifetime.\\n[in Gujarati] But with you, Nanaji, I’ll be able to do it, I hope. Sorry. “Hope…”\\n[laughter]\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThank you very much.\\n[Qawwali music playing]\\n[music ends]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAhir Shah, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen.\\nI don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!”\\nThis went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.\\nThat would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that.\\nI’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones.\\nIt doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots.\\nEverybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off.\\nI’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell.\\nIt’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.\\nA couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.\\nUh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.\\nI knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars.\\nAnd then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…”\\nAnd then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.”\\nHe was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them.\\nI know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out.\\nThe second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that.\\nSome people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect.\\nWe’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was.\\nBut if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated.\\nAnd then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off.\\nIf Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit.\\nYou know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in.\\nSomebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.”\\nThey’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening?\\nWait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.”\\nThe third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.”\\nWell, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike.\\nI remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us.\\nMy point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way.\\nI used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest.\\nHowever, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.”\\nAnd then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too.\\nThe ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure.\\nYeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works.\\nCan’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian.\\nObviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough.\\nYou guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true.\\n“♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪\\n♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪\\n♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪\\n♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪”\\nAnd his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪”\\nYou know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money.\\nLet’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

I forgot. The fourth time I met OJ Simpson. The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end.

Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you.\\nWhat a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up.\\nSo… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers.\\nThis is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens.\\nThe big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!”\\nSo, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers.\\nSo, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth.\\nYou don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird!\\nI know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah.\\nAnother question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.”\\nI did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit?\\nSo… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right?\\nBut apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free.\\nSo I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe.\\nI’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die.\\nI’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity.\\nBut I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner.\\nBut… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead?\\nBut… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks!\\nSo… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go.\\nThat’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!”\\nAnd there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much.\\nI hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went,\\xa0“Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nRicky Gervais, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 thought on “Ricky Gervais: Humanity (2018) | Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKen Wheelchair 22/03/2018 at 00:35  \\n\\n\\nProlefeed.\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that’s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I’m at the end of the tour right now. I’m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So… [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she’s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and I’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and I don’t see it getting better. Um… I’ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “Oh, I used to party with Madonna.” And I went, “You fucking what, when?” And she went, “I used to party with Madonna.” Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I’m not bragging. I didn’t get the model years. I didn’t get those years. I’ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um… So, I said, “So you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” And she went, “No, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” I go, “You need to elaborate on this story right now.” And she goes, “Oh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.” As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, “That’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” That’s a big one. “That’s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.” So she said, “I used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna’s house.” And she goes, “This one time, the four of us were over at Madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” And then I went, “Shut the fuck up!” And she went, “What?” I said, “I know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! You all started fucking each other!” And she went, “We did. We started…” “Just shut up!” And she goes, “What do you care for?” I said, “You’re the mother of my child! I don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ NBA player while you’re licking out Madonna’s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [Moaning] And she goes, “Oh, you’re being silly. What do you care for? You’ve partied way more than I have in my life.” And I went, “That is not true. I’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn’t call it a party.” For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It’s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We’re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, “Well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [Chuckles] I don’t… You know, I’ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I’ve had good nights out, but I’ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? I’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It’s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just… They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they’re going, “No, dude. Use the table. Don’t use your…” And I go, “Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um…” And it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring ’em in like, “Huh?” And you can do this. You can go… “Uh…” Like that. And they’ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.” When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.” And that’s a vastly different emotion that… I don’t think women will never… Yeah, okay.\\nThis is the thing. In America, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “And still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” And of course, that’s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like… a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don’t actually mean, but this is something I’m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I’m sorry. I… [Audience whooping] I’m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. I’m sure they do. I’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. What I’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now… I’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.” And don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. Right? We do. But there’s little things in society that you can’t change. Men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. There’s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine’s Day is just for women. They say it’s for romantics. They say it’s for couples or something like that. It’s just for women. There’s no man who gets excited by Valentine’s Day. There’s no man that when he sees the Valentine’s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “Oh, Valentine’s Day is coming!” Valentine’s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “How much money do I have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” It doesn’t stop there. Mother’s Day! Mother’s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend’s first Mother’s Day. And she went, “Oh, I wonder what I’ll get for Mother’s Day.” And I went, “Probably fucking nothing. He’s got no money. He’s six months old. What do you think he’s gonna buy you?” Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother’s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause I assumed that’s what Hank would have wanted her to have… and I wrote a card. I’m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I’m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] “Happy Mother’s Day. Love, Hank.” And I went, “H-A-N…” And then I did the “K” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. See, now I know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “Well, fathers have Father’s Day.” Father’s Day is bullshit. It’s fucking shit, Father’s Day. Father’s Day came around and my girlfriend went, “What do you want for Father’s Day?” And I went, “I don’t want anything. Don’t even worry about it. I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on. You gotta have something.” I said, “Honestly, I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on.” And I went, “It’s my fucking money. Just don’t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.” That’s why every single father has that one Father’s Day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! It’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “I heart Dad.” And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go… “That cost me nothing, that mug.” [Audience whooping] See… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I’ve got it, right? April 18th… Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It’s good, isn’t it? Everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It’s nice. A month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “Oh, the decorations are up!” [Men whooping] And it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine’s Day when they don’t get a gift. You could go like, “Oh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. They’ve, uh…” I’m thinking, I don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I’m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting “Jim Jefferies” on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, “April 18th.” ‘Cause it’s good, right? You’re in a bar. You’re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go… Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt.\\nThe weird thing is I’m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I’m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it’s a much more… I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex… Oh, you know… I do it. I get involved, ’cause I feel like I have to. You know, I… But I’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh… When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… But the thing is, you can’t smell porn. You don’t smell porn. You just… You just watch it. They never… And it’s different, porn. It’s different. They clean the girl’s asshole. They pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. I’m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She’s like… You’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “Put it in my ass.” She’s inviting. It’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. And then she’s like… She says things… I don’t know, things like, “I’m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.” And… And the experience I’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I’ve… My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… It’s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “I’m gonna act like I enjoy it.” She does that whole, “Yeah. Oh, no, that’s good.” [Moaning] Ahh! ♪ I’m having a good time ♪ And then they’re always going, “Are you done? Are you close to done?” You never fuck a pussy and they go, “Are you almost done? Finish this.” Like that. If you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don’t know how much they get paid. I’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. It’s the opposite bit of society. Um… But they do a thing called “ATM.” I don’t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for “ass to mouth.” That’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “I love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.” And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [Applause] she’s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. Now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “Well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering]\\nSo… I’m a father. Um… I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. He’s a good little boy. No, he’s a great little fella. I really like him. Um… My girlfriend super loves him, though. It’s fucking creepy. And… I’m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn’t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn’t fuck it. I… I just don’t get along with women. You know how it is. I don’t want them in my house, and… So… Because you dream, see… For example, okay? When Hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “Aw, that’s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.” That’s what I think… ‘Cause that’s what I think about my son. I hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. I don’t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “Oh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you’re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” Right, you know… And it’s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. They’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it’s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “Uh, uh!” Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, “Everyone, my boyfriend’s here. Here’s my boyfriend. Give him here. He’s my boyfriend.” And then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ It’s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl… Let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “Hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. Give her here. Give her here. She’s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She’s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don’t worry about a thing.” [Applause] [Cheering] So… Also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It’s just little things. Even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. There’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. I don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. ‘Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don’t give a shit. Fucking… My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I’ve got shit on my dick, I’ll ring me mate Jason up and go, “Hey, Jason… It’s happened again. I got shit on my dick.” And he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “Oh, I can’t wait to call Karen.” [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you… When my girlfriend got pregnant… When you meet… When you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “It is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.” And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “You’re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It’s over. You’re not gonna sleep.” They’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I’ve had girlfriends. That’s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “Fuck it! Let’s have a kid.” Fucking did it, right? These other people, man… You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “We’re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?” And you wanna say, “No, you’re really boring and we hate you.” But you go, “Oh, okay, great. You’re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.” And… And then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “We have to see how our careers are going and shit.” And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “From our family to yours.” And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “What the fuck is this shit?” And they’re like, “We had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.” And you go, “Well, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control…” And then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “What’s happening? A new person.” And they’re like, “Fuck off. We don’t love you anymore. We’re going.” And they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you’re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I’m not saying ’cause they look the same. I’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going… “Yolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.” [Jeffries chuckles]\\nI’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh… Gun control. Now… No, wait. Before you… Don’t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, “Yeah! Do it, Jim!” No, let’s just… [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I’m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the… Oh, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like guns, right? I’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn’t been beaten. And… Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. I don’t know how or why this happened, uh… Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, “That’s it! No more guns!” And we all went, “Yeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.” Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “Maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my guns!” [Whooping] So, here’s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It’s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “Fuck off. I like guns.” It’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. And there’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing wrong with saying, “I like something. Don’t take it away from me.” But don’t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] “I need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.” Really? Is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? Is it? I’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, “Well, that’d never happen to me.” You don’t know that, because you know what?\\n♪ From time to time We all get sad ♪ \\n♪ One day you’re happy Then you’re sad ♪ \\n♪ And then, uh-oh ♪\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] “Well, imagine if you had a gun.” And I’m like, “All right. I was naked at the time. I wasn’t wearing my holster. I wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.” What world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? You have guns ’cause you like guns! That’s why you go to gun conventions! That’s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “Fucking yeah!” Like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, “That’d never happen in my house ’cause I’m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.” Then they’re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you’re like, “Wait there, fuck-face! Oh! You’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I’m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother’s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother’s birthday? Maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [In whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, “None of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” I… I think they’re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] “Oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” And then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “You’re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.” Then she’d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “Why don’t they like me?” Let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, “Oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” They go, “We’ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.” Yeah, that’ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and… [Mimicking machine gun] And you’ve got Kevin. Now, I’m sure Kevin’s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don’t agree with me. Don’t think I don’t. Out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They’re looking around, going, “Wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” And then… there’s the last 10%. And they’re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. Just… And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I’m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “If you don’t like it, go home! If you don’t like it, go home!” And my answer to that is, “No.” I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I’ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And… unless you’re an American Indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It’s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don’t know what it says. I’ve never seen it. If there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. And don’t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had… Fucking, I get it, right? I’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I’m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] “You cannot change the Second Amendment!” And I’m like, “Yes, you can. It’s called an ‘amendment.'” If you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don’t think your constitution is set in stone. You’ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, “Hey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let’s get that one out. Let’s get that one out.” You used to have this other thing in America called, uh… slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, “That’s it. No more slaves!” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my slaves!” And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “Why should I have my slaves taken off me? I’m a responsible slave owner. I’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I… I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!” That’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me? I’ve done nothing wrong.” Look, I agree with you. If you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that’s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! “Oh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.” Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can’t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “Thanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” See, that’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me, I’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” Who’s to say you’re not crazy? That’s the thing about crazy people. They don’t know they’re crazy. That’s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, “I think, therefore I am.” You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that’s it. Right now, I think I’m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That’s what I think I’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] “I hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.” [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, “Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It’ll be delivered to your house. That’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. You’ve got $34,000. You’re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger’s as fuck. Right? I don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] “Guns! Who wants to sell me a gun?” Now, I’m gonna wrap this up. We won’t talk about it anymore. Now… See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with… That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [Audience cheering] – Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You’re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I’m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets… Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what’s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “Fuck you, buddy! Ah, you’re not a bad guy. You’re all right.”\\nNow… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause I don’t behave myself in there, so I’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘Cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like… Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That’s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “Hey, ladies. He’s a fireman.” And he comes out with his hose and like that… And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “You can’t take care of your kids.” It’s… And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don’t know… I don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. There’s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… That’s what a private “dance” is, right? I don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can’t imagine that there would be. I don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… She goes, “How was it?” And she goes, “Well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.”\\nSo Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. It was… I’m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… Now… The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He’s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now… the great thing about DJ is… he already looks disabled. He has that “latter stages of AIDS” thing going on. It’s great for casting. Anyway, but… I didn’t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors’ Union of America said, “You cannot do that.” Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, “All right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, “Can you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?” So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don’t know why. Maybe they’re just lazy. They don’t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I’d ever seen in my life. He was like… Think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of… [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and I’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, “Thank you so much for coming in.” And then we did the dialog together, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, “That’s our guy. That’s who we gotta pick.” And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought… “If he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” So he comes in… He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, “Whoa! What’s going on there, kicky?” And he goes… “Oh, you got me! I’m not disabled.” And I said, “You’re fucking what now?” And he goes, “I’m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.” And I said, “Just shut up. So let me… This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” And he went… “Yeah.” And I said, “You’re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.” And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and I’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and I just think, “I’m gonna call this guy up. I’m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?” And I’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like… And I thought, “This has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” The shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [Mimicking camera shutter] Like… [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “This guy’s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!” Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I’m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “Ta-da!” And we would have gone, “That was very good.” But I’ll tell you what you don’t do. Don’t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, “You did very good.” He’s like, “Thank you, Jim.” [Laughing]\\n[Chuckles] I was, uh… I go to a therapist… ’cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “I’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, “Red,” and I went, “Blue.” And then she went, “Cooking,” and I went, “Food,” and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went… For the last question, she went, “And what’s your favorite thing in the world?” And I went… “Coming on a girl’s face.” Now… Now, I could’ve said things like… “Ice cream” is a good answer. “Hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. But I said, “Coming on a girl’s face.” And I’ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. – I… – [Cheering] I’m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl’s on her knees and you… It’s so… And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, “When a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” There was never that… never that moment. But, by golly, if it’s not fun. I find it… To… Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, “Bravo!” Don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, “And here’s the women who take a load on their face.” And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “God bless you, ladies.” [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the… Like that… I don’t know why, but I enjoy… I know it’s a lie. I know you’re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it’s such a, “Oh, jeez, I’m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there’s a good chance I’ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.” But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I’m like, “You fucking slut… Oh, I love you. Ah… Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um… Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh… All right, I’m going to get a towel. I’ll get a towel. I’ll get you a towel. All right. You’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See… this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I’m there wiping come off his mother’s face.\\nI think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I’m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “Argh!” Like that. And I went… [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, “Hello, Hankie.” And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, “I love my daddy. Love, Hank.” But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the “K,” and… then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, “G’day, Hankie!” And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don’t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I’ve been telling everyone. And I can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He’s been training for this his entire life.\\nI think I’ve, uh… I think I’ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, “Oh, I think like an American person now.” And I’m happy to do it. I just… I’ll tell you what happened. I was flying around… I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I’m so used to airports and stuff here in America that… Okay, what happens is, when you go… I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don’t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “Tickets, please.” And I’m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. ‘Cause I get through airports quick, man. I’m like, “Fucking there you go.” And she went, “Put your ID away. I don’t need to see that.” And I went… “I think you do.” And she went, “I don’t… Why would I need to see your ID?” And I said, “I might be a terrorist.” And she went, “Would showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?” “No, I’d probably still blow the plane up.” So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I’m so good at the airports. I’m already taking my shoes off as I’m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I’m American, and they’re losing their fucking shit. They’re like, “Oh, for fuck’s sake! One of these cunts, eh?” And the TSA guy goes, “Hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” And I went… [Shouting] “I don’t know! Maybe they’re bombs?” And he went… “But they’re not, are they?” I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone’s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “Jeez, mate. That’s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?” “It might also be a bomb.” And then the guy said the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. He went… “Oh, come on, mate. You wouldn’t have two bombs.” [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense.\\nAll right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You’re fucking missing out, mate. If you don’t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine’s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone… He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine’s Day, right? Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running’s their second sport. You wouldn’t have thought that. Anyway… I’m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here’s the difference. Picture my accent, but I’m punching a black person. What I’m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So… she’s coming out of the shower. She’s been drying her hair. She’s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He’s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] “What the fuck is this? I’ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.” And she’s like, “Oh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?” “Who am I? I’m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That’s who the fuck I am.” “Well, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [Audience exclaiming] – I know. [Audience laughing] “Oh! Fuck you!” “No! Fuck you! I’m leaving you!” And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “You fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day… that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don’t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!” That’s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. “Oh, you’re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.” She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn’t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar’s one of the few men on Earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so… Boing! Ah! So… I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now… in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look… I’ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. I’ve never raped a man, but… if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. Like, “You want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?” There’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He’s the hero.\\nAll right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, – I thank you very much for coming. – [Audience groaning] No, I said, “soon,” not “over.” It’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always… I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I’m going to go, “Fucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.” [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don’t think I’ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don’t know if I’ll be invited this time. They’ll be like, [In South African accent] “We don’t like him. He’s no good.” Anyway, so, I’m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You’ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um… But it was all right ’cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn’t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice ’cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I’ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. So… I’m wearing a white T-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, “Hello,” and the lady goes, [In South African accent] “Oh, Mr. Jefferies, I’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” I said, “You what now?” She goes, “Business class is full. You have been downgraded.” And I said, “I understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.” And she went, “I’m sorry, sir. There’s nothing I can do.” And then I just went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” Now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” And she went, “Please do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!” And I said, “Are you, a white South African, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” Anyway… tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] “What is wrong here? What is wrong?” And I said, “I bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.” And he goes, “What do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can’t do anything.” He goes, “I’ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, “There’s nothing I can do.” So I walk off with my ticket. I’m walking through the airport like, “Fucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, “Tickets, please.” And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] “I’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” And I said… [Inhales sharply] “I bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “Next.” [Audience exclaiming] “Listen here, you fucking cunt.” [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, “Don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” And I said, “I want to speak to Simon Fulcher,” like I’m… And they go, “All right.” They ring the manager up, and then they go… He goes, “Is it the pale Australian man?” And the guy went, “Yes.” He goes, “We’ve had problems with him. Let him through.” Right? So I go through. I’m sitting there, I’m eating my peanuts. And I’m just angry now, going, “Fucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking…” Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all… And whenever I see Americans abroad… I’ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. You’re just walking around going, [In American accent] “Oh, this is great! Look at that. That’s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what’s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.” Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] “Did anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.” And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, “You can fuck off and all! You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve been downgraded!” And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “Fucking downgraded!” And the woman in the group was doing this, “Don’t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?” And all the men in the group were like, “Hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.” ♪ It doesn’t matter These people seem very angry, so ♪ And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] “Hey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.” And then I thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and I said, “Look, mate, don’t worry about it. It’s not like it’s your fault.” And I said, “Why are you in such a big group anyway?” And he goes, “Oh, we’re in Neil Diamond’s band. That’s Neil Diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and I reacted like he was one. I went, “Neil Diamond!” And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] “Hey, what’s going on?” And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, “Neil! Me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” And Neil went, “Oh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.” “You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!” And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don’t know if you have the Internet, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. “Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!” Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let’s have a drink. Bye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJim Jefferies, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.”\\nYou’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.”\\nIt’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?\\'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around.\\nI talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?”\\nMy wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.”\\nI grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.\\'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.”\\nMy wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.”\\nI have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.”\\nI loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!”\\nI didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo.\\nIt’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was.\\nAnd there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.”\\nKids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.”\\nNo, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.”\\nMy dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.\\'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero.\\nThe weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.”\\nWhat are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy.\\nI was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.”\\nI temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.\\'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy.\\nThat’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it.\\nI wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.\\nThat is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president.\\nAnd I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton.\\nMy mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton.\\nNow, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later?\\nSo, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!”\\nI learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!”\\nAnyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service.\\nWe land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life.\\nAnd I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992.\\nLet’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.\\nGood night, Chicago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJohn Mulaney, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

What’s happening? What’s going on, Bay Area? Listen to me, tonight, tonight’s gonna be special, San Jose.\\n[music ends]\\nYou know what I love when I look out here? I love the diversity I see here. [audience laughs and cheers] Not racially. Financially. [audience laughs] [Hasan chuckles jokingly] The good stuff. The stuff that matters. The stuff that’s real. The money, all right? There’s money in this room. But there’s also not money in this room. [audience laughs] That’s the Bay. You’re not as progressive as you think you are, Bay Area. In this room right now, there’s a guy who owns three homes. And he’s sitting directly next to a dude who only owns three hoodies. [audience laughs] And one of y’all’s getting stabbed tonight. It’s probably the landlord.\\n[laughs]\\n[audience laughs]\\nBecause it’s all here. I can see it. It’s all here. Whoo-hoo. We got it all here. We got the one percent, right? We got, like, Palo Alto, Los Altos. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Stanford area, right? Yeah, the one percent. Yeah! Yes. You definitely drive a Tesla. I can see it. [audience laughs] Yeah, the one percent right here, eh? Then way the fuck back there, we have the 99% just… [audience cheering] Hayward, Richmond, East Oakland. Yeah! Yeah, this is your landlord! Kill him! Kill him! Why does he keep raising the rent? [laughs] This is why I had to do it in the Bay. Even when you’re rich in the Bay, you’re poor. [audience laughs] You could be a Google engineer making 900 grand a year, and you have to live in a trap house in East Oakland, and you’re on OnlyFans making them cheeks clap just so you can pay rent. Just so you can pay this uncle rent. Dude, we have Zillow.com, and we’re still a functioning society. How? Do you know what Zillow.com is? Zillow.com is a website where you can type in the address of someone you’re jealous of… [audience laughs] and you can see their mortgage payment. [audience laughs] Dude, we’re never gonna own. Millennials, Gen Z, y’all are never, never gonna own homes.\\nAnd it’s our fault.\\n[woman] Yup. We fumbled the bag. Because for years we were praying to God. “God, please fix the housing crisis.” “Please open up the supply of available homes in this country.” And then, in March of 2020, God was like, “Here.” [audience laughs] “Here’s a disease that specifically kills old people.” [audience laughs] And we were like, “No!” “Wear a mask!” “Save Grandma!” “Stop the spread!” Let it spread. [audience laughs] Let God cook. [audience laughing and cheering] Yeah, we’re idiots, Californians. We’re fucking idiots. Look at all the states that were anti-mask. Plenty of homes. [audience laughs] Nevada, Georgia, Florida. Plenty of homes. Plenty of dead grandmas. These people accept God’s blessings. [audience laughs] All I’m saying is if you were pro-mask, you cannot complain about housing prices. What do you want? You wanna save Grandma or you want a backyard? You can’t have both. [audience laughs] Dude, the same problem with the housing market, these fucking Boomers will not die, is the same problem with the US government.\\nThese fucking Boomers will not die.\\n[audience cheers]\\nOur entire government is just a mass nursing home-dot-gov. I mean, it’s fucking… Uncle, why are you clapping? That’s you. You’re like, “Yeah!” What? Even he’s like, “They’re too old, man!” [audience laughs] This is gonna come out right before the election. People are arguing about the president. Fucking zoom out. Look at Congress. There’s 535 members of Congress, and they’re all old as fuck. Dude, Nancy Pelosi is 84 years old. [audience murmuring] Is anyone here 84 years old? [audience laughs] Yeah, of course not! Yes, it’s 7:00 p.m. Of course not! It’s seven o’clock. You’re asleep. Of course you’re not here. Why would you be here? Why the fuck would you be here? People are like, “Oh, Hasan, you’re really ageist.” “That really age…” Yeah, I am capital-A ageist. [audience laughs] Write about it. Substack it. Make it the headline. “I am age…” Age matters. Ask Drake. [audience exclaims] It is a pertinent detail. Hey! Hey! Hey! I thought we were the science people. Progressives, “Trust the science.” “Believe the science. Don’t let your kids on social media.” “The synapses in their brain…” “The synapses in their brain are still develo…” “The synapses.” Senator Chuck Grassley is 90 years old. [audience laughs] What do you think the synapse…? What… [audience cheering] He has the MRI brain scan of an NFL quarterback. It’s fucking applesauce up there. Why don’t we treat our politicians the same way we treat our professional athletes? Here in America, the moment you lose just a little bit of edge as an athlete, we fucking turn on you. [audience laughs] Within two years. Even the GOATs, right? Michael Jordan with the Wizards. Kobe with the Achilles. Look at the way that we treated Tom Brady. The moment Tom Brady couldn’t give us an eighth Super Bowl, we were like, “Brady, you got two more years.” This motherfucker lost to the Rams, right? “One more year, Brady.” Then this motherfucker lost to the Cowboys. “Bring this old geezer to the back of the shed.” “Let’s put two bullets into his skull.” “Let’s tear apart his marriage. Let’s ridicule his children.” “Let’s roast his ass on Netflix in 190 countries and just piss all over his legacy.” Just, “Tudum!”\\n[audience whooping]\\n[laughs] Now look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [audience exclaims] Eighty-seven years old! Ruth Bader Ginsburg battled cancer, five times in the last 20 years of her life. And Barack Obama was like, “Please, Ruth, for the love of God, retire so I can replace you.” And this geriatric coffin-dodger was like, “Fuck you, Barry.” [audience laughs] “I’ll see you in fucking hell.” [audience laughs] And every progressive was like, “Yas, queen!” “Notorious RBG.” If we treated Ruth Bader Ginsburg the same way we treated Tom Brady, abortion would still be legal in all 50 states. [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s interesting? Depending on where I do that joke, the audience reacts very differently. Sometimes when I do that joke, Trump fans get mad at me. Sometimes Biden fans get mad at me. But here’s my thing. Why are you a fan? [audience laughs] You know? Like, you’re like a fan of a president. You have like a T-shirt. You have like a poster on the wall. Like, “This is my guy!” “He’s my…” Like, being a fan of a politician is like being a fan of a national bank. [audience laughs] Imagine walking through downtown San Jose and seeing some loser with a T-shirt. Just like, “Citibank!” You see another guy, “No, fuck you, bro! Wells Fargo!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Do you wanna be on the right side of history?” It’s like, dude, I’ve banked with both. They will disappoint you for different reasons. Because I’ve met these people. I’ve met all of them. I’m part of the Illuminati. [audience laughs] They all reach out to me during election season. They think I’m the brown whisperer. [audience laughs] They think if we have lunch, I’ll blow the conch. Know what I mean? I’ll be like… [imitates blowing conch shell] “Browns… we must vote for Andrew Yang!” [audience laughs and applauds] No, why are you clap… No, don’t clap! They’re all fucking insane. I am 38 years old. This will be the tenth presidential cycle of my lifetime. Every president in my lifetime goes into office a sociopath and then leaves a war criminal. [whoops] Because they all want one thing. You know what they want? They want the ring. Ooh, they want the ring of power. They want it. They want it more than marriage, more than family. More than their kids. Look at Hillary Clinton. Look at how bad Hillary Clinton wanted to be president. Hillary Clinton wanted to be president so bad, she was willing to sit in the same office… [audience exclaiming] Not a different office. Not a replica House of Cards office. The Oval Office. That is sociopathic ambition. That’s why there’s so many Indians in politics. [audience laughs] Bro, we got sociopathic ambition. In one generation, look how many Indians there are in politics, running the highest offices around the world. One generation. Rishi Sunak. Nikki Haley. Vivek Ramaswamy. Half of Kamala Harris when she wants our vote. We are fucking killing it!\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Hasan laughs] Dude… Look at the Republican Party. There are more Indians in the Republican Party than my bachelor party. [audience laughs] And right now it’s wild. Y’all, more minorities with melanin, ooh, joining the hard-R Republicans. It’s happening more than ever. And all my white NPR tote-bag friends, it fries their brain. They’re like, “What the fuck is going on?” “Why are all these Mexicans voting for Donald Trump?” [audience laughs] “He calls them rapists!” I’m like, “Chelsea… do you know what I would let a politician call me if I could pay zero percent federal income tax?” [audience laughs] “I would let you body-cavity search me at every airport.” “Spit in my mouth and call me a terrorist.” [imitates spitting] Daddy wants to pay zero-percent FICA. That’s the thing Caucasia will never understand about Beige-istan. We are way more practical than we are progressive. [audience laughing and cheering]\\nSir, what’s your name?\\nNicholas. Nicholas. Great, perfect.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] You’re clapping at “Beige…” Do you know what Beige-istan is?\\nSort of.\\nOkay. You’re like, “Sort of”? Gentlemen, let me bring you into this as well.\\nMy good sir, what’s your name?\\nVlad. Vlad. Perfect. And…?\\nIan.\\n…Ian. Okay. So there’s… There’s white America. There’s Black America. Then there’s Beige-istan. [audience laughs] And, I mean, that’s just everybody. Indians, Latinos, Filipinos, wherever the fuck Bruno Mars is from. Beige-istan. Right? Okay? Listen, Beige-istan, we got four issues. Politicians, they pander to us. We just got four issues. You do these four, we’ll vote for you. Send this to the governor. These are the four issues. Number one. Give me a green card. [audience laughing and cheering] [laughs] You see that? Everyone, “I’ll suck your dick! Give me that green card!” “Give me an H-1B!” Number two. Believe in God. Preferably one of the religions that makes you feel bad after you masturbate.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThose are the real ones. Number three. I told you, I don’t like paying taxes. [audience laughs] Number four. Don’t bomb my home country. [audience cheering and whooping] But if you give me number one… I’ll let you do number four. [Hasan laughs maniacally] The way you leaned into him, you know what I’m talking about! You know the Beige guilt. We feel so much Beige guilt. Oh! We talk about white guilt all the time. You know what you did. God knows what you did, right? Black people, you have no guilt. That’s why you guys can dance, right? You didn’t hurt anybody. Like, “Look at the rhythm.” He can’t dance. Like, “Slavery!” Fuck, right? It’s too much. It’s too much. But Beige guilt’s different. Beige guilt, we’re immigrants. We’re immigrants by choice. We know the world is like Star Wars. You have the Empire ran by Lord Vader, that’s America. [audience laughs] The Empire has all the money, the weapons, the military bases all over the galaxy. And for the past half-century, the Empire has been bombing the shit out of the Rebellion. That’s Beige-istan. Cambodia, Korea, Vietnam, Japan. [scats “The Imperial March\\nDarth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza. [scats “The Imperial March\\nDarth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Then in 1982, my dad got a green card to go live in the Empire. And for the past 40 years, we’ve been funding the destruction of Tatooine. And we did all that… for a white BMW 3 Series. [audience laughing and whooping] Which ironically looks like a Stormtrooper. [audience laughs] I’m joking, by the way. I don’t own a white BMW 3 Series. I lease… [audience laughs] …a 2023 Kia Carnival. I lease it. So if you wanna fact-check me, I just wanna let you know, I lease a 2023 Kia Carnival, $431 a month. We leased it from Columbia Kia. We got it at the Summer Kia Sales Event. You can get a brand-new Kia Sorento or Kia Carnival for zero down, zero APR financing. The Kia Summer Sales Event starts now. Kia, movement that inspires. I have to do this now, you guys. I have to be factually accurate. Because I don’t know if you saw this last year. The New Yorker fact-checked my stand-up comedy.\\n[audience whooping]\\n[laughs] Yeah. They were just like, “Ah! Ho-ho-ho! Breaking news. Magicians aren’t wizards.” And now, now I have a “controversies” tab on my Wikipedia. [audience laughing and applauding] No! Why are you… No! Don’t clap! What are you doing? Why are you clapping? What the fuck is wrong… It’s a dorky controversy. What is wrong with you guys? It’s not even a good one. I didn’t fuck a porn star. [audience laughs] I didn’t diddle a boy. [audience laughs] I got caught embellishing for dramatic effect. [audience laughs] Same crime your aunt is guilty of over Thanksgiving. [audience laughs] [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s wild? This is the greatest irony. The greatest irony of all of this is that if you want to call me out for being a liar, you don’t have to fact-check my stand-up comedy. I’m a heterosexual man. [audience laughs] I lie all the time. [audience laughs] I let that shit fly like Steph. Like, I’m just like, “Lie.” Oh! Lie. Like, let it fly. Over dumb shit. Stupid… I’ll be at CVS checking out. Just… [imitating scanner beeping] Like, “Oh, my God. Hey!” “Um, do you wanna donate to the American Diabetes Association?” I’ll be like, “Oh, yeah, maybe later.” I’m never donating. [audience laughs] And both my parents have diabetes.\\n[audience exclaiming and laughing]\\n[Hasan laughs] Yes! You can’t guilt… No, don’t you fucking judge me. I have already donated to the Minhaj Diabetes Association. I bought my dad a fucking Peloton. He never uses it. [audience laughs] He only uses it to hang his wet towels. He’s like, “Oh, look at that. Wow.” “Look at how fast it dries, Hasan. Wow! Why aren’t you donating?” I’m like, “Why aren’t you pedaling?” Let’s start with the problem and not the symptom. I’m never donating. And I’m definitely getting diabetes. That’s the crazy part. And I should care. I’m almost 40 years old. I can feel it. The midlife crisis has hit. There’s a lot of guys my age, around this age. I can feel it in the room. Every guy my age is trying to get rich or ripped as quickly as possible. [audience laughs] Just software engineers out here biohacking. Fucking cold-plunging. Fucking doing Brazilian jujitsu. Fucking doing this shit. [audience laughs] Fucking flipping tires. Idiots. Idiots. Fucking pharmacist hard pivoting into financial experts. Getting into crypto. Idiots. Every woman in my life, y’all could not be bothered by crypto fucking currency. You’re just like, “Nah.” “I know what this is.” “I had an aunt that sold Avon. This is some bullshit.” [audience cheering] “This is Herbalife for men.” Go back upstairs and keep playing fantasy football, you fucking idiot. [audience laughs] How old are you, my man?\\n17.\\n17? So you were looking into crypto for sure. [laughs] You know what it is? I’m part of a generation of men that don’t read, but listen to podcasts. [audience laughs] Terrifying. All my homeys out here texting me alpha-male memes, just… “Hard times make hard men.” “Hard men make good times.” “Good times make soft men.” “A society will never value its men until the wolves are at the door.” I’m like, “Sanjay, you’re a software engineer.” “Shut the fuck up.” Why… [audience cheering and whooping] Why are you texting me like you’re Julius Caesar? “Whatever, bro.” “Mamba mentality.” Mamba mentality! Sanjay, you blew your knee out playing pickleball and you’re quoting Kobe Bryant. If Kobe knew you were quoting him, he’d put you in a helicopter and crash that shit himself. [audience exclaiming] [man coughing] You okay, bro? Don’t die. You all right? [audience laughs] [laughs] It wasn’t… How old are you, bro?\\nI’m 19.\\nYou’re 19. Big chain poppin’! Ooh! [laughs] [Hasan laughs] There’s a lot of chains on right now. Just a lot of, “Ooh.” A lot of just Desi Drake energy here tonight. The way y’all are lined up is fucking Algebra 2 Trig, just like, ta-ta! Ninety-degree angle just fucking make it. Make it perpendicular. Ladies, you wanna know why all these guys secretly listen to Jordan Peterson?\\n[woman 1] Why?\\n[woman 2] Why? I’ll tell you why. I’ll tell you. We’re scared. We’re so afraid that the best is behind us. The best hairline. [audience laughs] The best body. The best dick. [audience laughs] Back there. You’re 17, right? [scoffs] I remember 17, man. How old are you?\\n[man] I’m 39.\\nYou’re 39? Remember when you were 17? Remember when your shit was just like, pow! Remember when it was just… [yells] Right? It was like the Bruce Lee one-inch punch. You’re just like… [yells] [audience laughs] You remember that shit, man? When I’d be at a urinal, it was just… Tsst! Tsst! Tsst! It was like a laser. It was just like fucking SEAL Team Six taking out Osama bin Laden. Just, “Got him!” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, “Clear! Got him!” Right? And now, 38, my shit is just… Whoo. It’s just… Pew! It’s just like an Israeli drone strike. Just… Oh fuck, it’s a school. Oh fuck, it’s a church. Oh, fuck, it’s a refugee camp. I didn’t mean for it to go there. [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs] That really divided the room. You know, it’s interesting. That’s every issue in America now. Everything is binary now. War, the economy, politics, it’s just two sides. It’s not what the media’s telling you. It’s not rich versus poor. It’s not Black versus white. It’s not Democrats versus Republicans. It’s insane people and insufferable people.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s it! All right? [audience cheering and whooping] [Hasan laughs] You know the insane people. You know them. You went to high school with them. They’re still on Facebook. They have a gun in their Facebook profile photo. You’re like, “Whoa, Travis.” “What up?” “Where were you January 6th?” [audience laughs] They’re nuts. They’re nuts. But Travis is fun. [audience laughs] Then there’s the insufferable people. [sighs] [clicks tongue] A lot of them are here tonight. [audience laughs] Just these dorky-ass, teacher’s pet, hall monitors. Just, “No, no, no, no, no!” “No, but actually.” “No, but tech…” These vitamin D-deficient, mouth-breathing, insufferable lo… “You said this, but it’s actually this. You wrote this, but…” “Did you see my Slack? I pinged you.” These insufferable losers that pick pointless fights. The type of insufferable losers that will go on a daytime talk show like Ellen and get mad at Ellen DeGeneres for mispronouncing their name. I mean, what type of insufferable fucking loser would do such a thing?\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, that was me. I was that person. Yes, that’s a rhetorical question. Yes, you were 13 when this happened. Years ago, I went on Ellen’s talk show and I go, “Hey, Ellen.” “Hey, Ellen DeGeneres.” “My name isn’t Hasan Minhaj.” “It’s Hasan Minhaj.” “Say it right.” “This is the name of my ancestors.” Of course she couldn’t say it right. Because she’s Ellen. [audience laughs] She’s a 65-year-old white billionaire who lives in Montecito. She can’t speak Urdu. [audience laughs] She’s Ellen, she’s not a Sufi poet. [audience laughs] And ever since I fought this pointless fight, people say my name worse. [audience laughs] People run up to me in the street and they shout the wrong name at me with vigor. [audience laughs] Like they’re trying to score points on Duolingo. [audience laughs] They’re just like, “Hussein!” [audience laughing] “Hummus!” “Hamas!” Ding, ding, ding! “Yes! Yes! Yes!” “I knew his name was Hamas!” “Five letters. Starts with an H.” “He looks like a Hamas.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Take me to the tunnels.” I’m like, “I don’t know where they are.” Oh, no. Ian! My life is perfect and I’m out here arguing with Ellen over vowels. Why did I do that? Why did I… Why wasn’t… [muttering] Why did I do that? I was so insufferable. I used to make fun of my Chinese friends for having two names. Yeah. I used to make fun of Ronny Chieng for being an Asian sellout. [audience laughs] Wait, you think Ronny Chieng’s real name is Ronny Chieng? [audience laughs] Look at his face. Look at his Chinese-Malay… No! His real name is Xin Yi Chieng. But he knows if he meets Ian… Ian will be like, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, streaming now on Disney Plus.” So instead…\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n…he goes, “Hi!” “I’m Ronald McDonald.” “Nice to meet you.” “Here to bring shareholder value to the company.” “Call me Ron-Ron.” [audience laughs] Because Chinese people are smart. They know you have to have a Chinese name, and then Americans-are-dumb-as-fuck name. [audience laughs] But I was the problem. “No…” [muttering] “It’s the point!” And it bit me in the ass. I remember I used to close my set with this joke. In New York City it would be my closer. I’d be like, “Ronny Chieng is an Asian sellout, good night!” I’m leaving the club. And this woman in the audience gets up and chases me into the street. She was like, “Excuse me.” “Oh, ho-ho! I could be a normal person, but I have a point to prove.” [audience laughs] And I’m not gonna say her ethnicity… [audience laughs] [audience laughs] …but her name was Ashley. [audience laughs] E-I-G-H. Just…\\n[audience exclaims]\\n[yells] “Excuse me. Can I see the manager?” “Hi! Hello. Hi.” “Hey stop.” “Hello.” “Hmph.” [audience laughs] “I saw your skit back there.” “And I have to say, ‘really?'” “Really?” “Making fun of Asian names.” “These are the jokes we’re making with our platform?” [audience laughs] “Um, Hagh-hen…” “India is a part of Asia.” “Do better.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Ash-league… [audience laughs] …no the fuck it’s not.” “There’s Indians and there’s Asians.” [audience laughing and whooping] “And we don’t fuck with each other.” [audience laughs] “In fact, Ashley-egg… you can’t stop Asian hate because Asians all hate…” [woman] Each other! “…each other,” thank you! “Furthermore, Ashleg-ha… here’s a dirty little secret.” “White people… [scoffs] …you’re not even the best at racism.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Wait, no, don’t get me wrong, they had a lot of hits. They had some bangers, right? Slavery, Jim Crow. Just, mwah, classics. But… But… some new teams have emerged to compete for the title. [audience laughs] See, now this is important. Fact-check me here. See, when white people are racist, they’re racist against people that don’t look like them. [audience laughs] Which is wrong. But it kind of makes sense. Asian people? [audience laughs] We hate people who look exactly fucking like us.\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\nIn fact… if you touch countries with us… [laughs maniacally] …we hate you even more! It’s fucking crazy. Look at us, right? Hindustanis, Indians. Who do we shit on?\\n[man] Pakistanis!\\nPakistanis, right? Pakistanis. You shit on Bengalis. Bengalis, you shit on Sri Lankans. Sri Lankans shit on Nepalese people. That’s just the hairy Asians. [audience laughs] Let’s talk about the hairless Asians, shall we? They’re here. Let’s talk about them. Let’s air it out. Let’s say what we can’t say at the DEI meeting. Let’s just get it out, right? Right? Chinese people. Yes! You shit on Koreans, right? Koreans shit on Japanese people. Japanese people shit back on Koreans. Both of those people shit on Chinese people. Meanwhile, Taiwan and Tibet, they’re like, “Hey!” “What about us?” And China’s like, “Shut the fuck up.” “You don’t even exist.” [laughs] Oh. Oh. You think Fox News dads are the problem? You think Ian’s dad is the problem? [laughs] Really? Try talking race relations with an Indian or Chinese father. Try asking this Indian uncle what he thinks of Black people. Oh, fuck!\\nOh, ho-ho! Oh!\\n[audience exclaiming] Enter the 36 chambers of fucking insanity. Try… [laughs] He’ll be like, “The phones are locked, right?” It’ll be fucking crazy. Try explaining George Floyd to an Indian dad. Oh, I did. Oh, we all did. June, 2020. I’m upstairs in Sacramento, in my childhood bedroom. My dad runs into my bedroom panting. “Oh my God, Hasan, are you watching the news?” “Why is Target on fire?” [audience laughs] This was his line. Target is ablaze. The civil war has begun. Where will I get my towels to hang over my Peloton? [audience cheering and whooping] And I was like, “Dad, stop it.” This is an important moment in our nation’s history. For the first time in 40 years, Beige-istan has been asked to pick a team.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd we have to pick a team tonight. My dad’s like, “What are the teams?” [audience laughs] I’m like, “All right, Dad, sit down.” This is important. Let me just explain this to you. [sighs] All right, Dad, there’s two teams. All right? So there’s Black Lives Matter. All right? Black people are saying, “Hey, treat us like human beings.” Then there’s All Lives Matter. And they’re like, “Hey.” “No!” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Those are the teams. Which team do you wanna pick? And he’s like, “Hasan, both of these people are idiots.” No one matters. [audience laughing and whooping] What? “What’s your GPA? I’ll tell you if you matter.” I mean, this dude is fucking Thanos. I go, “Dad, never say this in public. Don’t go to work and say this.” “We live in America.” “This is a multiracial democracy, Dad, all right?” “We’re trying to unspool the vestiges of white supremacy.” He’s like, “Hasan, white supremacy isn’t real.” “Don’t let them colonize your mind, man.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Come to my office.” You know, every dad has an office. It’s just some room in the house with dusty filing cabinets and a Windows 95 CD-ROM drive. He goes, “Hey, come sit before my Compaq Presario that I’ve had for the past 28 years.” “Sit here. I have to teach you a lesson.” My dad, on his computer, has pulled up a PDF of the US census. It is queued up to income by ethnicity. He’s like, “Read it.” [speaks in Urdu] Okay. These are the highest earners by ethnicity. Number one. Indian Americans. [audience cheering] Average dual, median income, $120,000 per year. [man] Wow. I know, that’s nothing in the Bay. [audience laughs] [laughs] I heard a guy, “Wow.” Number two. Distant second. [audience laughs] Whites. Parentheses, non-Hispanics.\\n[audience laughs]\\nRacist. Yo, the US government is so racist. They’re like, “None of you light-skinned, Bad Bunny-looking Latinos.” “None of you Ricky Martin, Pau Gasol-looking Latins.” “We want purebred, Viking, Mayflower white.” Average dual, median income, $76,000 per year. My dad goes, “Hasan, you see that?” [audience laughs] “Ha. Even on their best day, the white man is three-fifths of an Indian.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] I know. Yo! Bars, Dad. Fucking bars. Up top, Pops. Up top. He’s like, “Now look how much Jews make.” I’m like, “No, no, no. I’m not doing that.” “Come on, man. It’s for research.” I go, “That sounds worse.” Don’t say it’s for research. But that’s my dad. He’s Mufasa, I’m Simba. He lives within me.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd now I have a four-year-old son. I can’t teach him that. [laughs] I can’t be like, “Hey, son, no one matters.” Mwah! “Go live your life.” [audience laughs] “Life is nothing but an elephant graveyard.” I can’t do that. I remember I was back home in Sacramento. I was visiting my parents because they have diabetes. [audience laughs] This is a powerful moment in my life. Because I have two children now. I have my kids and I have my parents. [audience laughs] I’m sitting in between. We’re sitting on the couch. Seventy-four-year-old dad. Four-year-old son. I’m in the middle. And they’re both just screaming into their iPads. [audience laughs] They’re like, “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” Right? I’m like, “I’m here, don’t you cry.” “Don’t you cry.” [speaks in Urdu] “Don’t you cry. I’m here.” I’m the halftime show. I have to figure out, what am I taking from this old man and passing on to my son? What is some shit I got to delete?\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s our biggest challenge, right? How do we break generational trauma? We have to figure out, what’s an heirloom that we take from our past and pass on? And what is some baggage we gotta leave at Goodwill? [audience laughs] Because our parents, they fucked us up. They gave us a lot of baggage. But at the same time, there’s a lot of beautiful heirlooms that our parents gave us in Beige-istan that we took for granted. Uncle, we took this for granted. Here’s something you gave your children that they took for granted. No matter how bad you fuck up in Beige-istan, tax evasion, fraud, stand-up comedy… [audience laughs] …you can always go home. In fact…\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n…our parents’ greatest dream would be if we never left home. I’m almost 40 years old. I have a wife, I have two kids. My mom’s greatest dream would be if I moved back upstairs to my childhood bedroom. Just quietly having an orgasm underneath the Scottie Pippen poster, just… Just, “Oh, babe, keep it down.” “Sweetheart, my mom’s downstairs. Just be quiet.” My mom would be thrilled. “Wow, my son is climaxing under Toy Story sheets.” “This is what I always wanted.” “Our khandan is together.” She would come in with sliced fruit, just… “Kids, do you want apples?” I’d be like, “Mom!” [audience laughs] “I told you, I like peanut butter!” [audience laughs] “Bring me peanut butter!” But Ritz-cracker Americans? Purebred capital-A Americans? No, no, no, no, no. Zero to eighteen, you get to live at home. The day you turn 18… I’ve been to the graduation party. Dad gets on the mic. “Travis!” “Ha, ha. Happy graduation, bud.” “Get the fuck out of my house!”\\n[audience whooping]\\n“The next time you walk through that door, you better PayPal me, bitch.” I mean, this… [audience laughs] This is why there’s so many homeless people in America. None of these people can go home. [audience laughs] Oh, are you getting uptight? You getting uptight? Really? Really? Let me ask you a question, San Jose. Have you ever seen an Indian homeless person in America? [audience cheering and whooping] Huh? No. Hey, I’ll bet you a Kia Carnival. [audience laughs] Let’s go to the worst part of the Bay… Let’s go to the Tenderloin tonight, all right? Just imagine seeing a 5’7″ bespeckled Indian man. Cardboard cutout, “Hungry, homeless.” “I need help.” You’d be like, “Rajif?” [audience laughs] “Go home.” [audience laughs] “Come home. Live… What are you doing? Get in the car.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, to be fair. To be fair… There are a lot of Indian homeless people in India. [audience laughs] There’s like a lot. They’ve won the Oscar, they made documentaries, it’s crazy. [laughs]\\nWhere’s your family from originally?\\nBangalore.\\nBangalore? Ever been back?\\nYeah. You remember when you go back to the motherland, back to Beige-istan, and you’re sitting in the rickshaw with your mom the first time.\\nRight? 17, you’re young.\\nThey walk up… Yeah, then the kid with one arm walks up to the… Starts banging on the window with the stub, just… “Madam! Madam!” “Please, madam, please!” [speaks in Urdu] “Give me one rupee, please.” Then your mom, she’s a piece of shit. She goes, “Don’t look at them!” “Don’t you look at them. They’ll steal your soul!” “Don’t look at them!” And she goes, “I’m sorry!” “I’m sorry, I don’t have any money. I have to buy jewelry.” [audience laughs] “I have to buy bangles. Do you understand?” “See, bangles, they go on your arms.” “But you don’t have any arms, so you wouldn’t understand.” [audience laughs] “And me getting bangles is more important than you eating.” Am I lying? Am I lying? Go into any Desi woman’s closet. That shit is like the cave scene from Aladdin, just… “Touch nothing but the lamp.” I mean, auntie, look at you. Just fucking bedazzled. You just robbed pirates. Look, just… Ah! Just fucking rapper bling. [audience laughs] You know all those kids, right?\\n[boy] Huh?\\nYou know, when you sit in the rickshaw. And all those kids surround your car like The Walking Dead? [hisses] Right? [audience laughs] They’re all related. They’re all family. That’s what I want for my kids. [audience laughs] I’m not giving them shit. I want them to beg as a family. [audience laughs] But they can live with me. That I will allow. Mi casa, su casa. Come and go as you please. No boundaries. We don’t believe in boundaries. [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, let me ask you a question. Watch me hit this… This is a Tim Duncan bank shot. Watch me land this joke perfect. Okay? I’m 38. He’s 17, right?\\nWhat’s your name?\\nSunaad.\\nWhat’s that?\\nSunaad. Sunaad? Watch this. Sunaad, growing up, could you close your bedroom door and then lock the bedroom? Of course not! This is what I’m talking about! No! If I… [audience cheering and whooping] If I locked my bedroom door, that shit would turn into The Shining within sec… “Hey! Hey! Hey!” “Are you watching pornography?” And it’s like… [audience laughs] [audience whooping] I am. [audience laughs] But it’s none of your business. “Never lock the door!” Why? Why? Uncle, why? What’s the logic? Why? Why can’t we… It doesn’t make sense! “Never lock the door.” I tried to explain this to my… “Dad, what if I have to go to the bathroom and take a dump?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Then close the door.” “But don’t lock it.” [audience laughs] “I might have to take a shower.”\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\nYou laugh. No, no, no, you laugh. That’s how much my dad loves me. He’s willing to take a hot shower in my shit fumes. [audience laughs] Just… [singing in Urdu] [imitates farting] That is love. [audience laughs] You wish your dad knew your scent, Ian. But no. No, no, no. In Caucasia, you love your boundaries. “Boundaries!” “Hey, Mom? Boundaries!” “Mom? Hey, bitch, these are my boundaries, you bitch.” “I know I ripped through your vagina to your taint, but these are my boundaries, you bitch.” Not only are you obsessed with emotional boundaries, you’re obsessed with physical boundaries. You literally pick the boundaries for the entire world. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh…” [audience whooping] “Africa, here are your boundaries.” “Asia, here are your boundaries.” “Middle East, here are your boundaries.” “Peace.” No, there’s no peace. [audience laughs] We’re around the corner from the election. What’s the biggest issue that the Republicans are using in regards to your safety?\\n[man] The border.\\nThe border. [audience laughs] A bunch of Republican senators are out here acting like hormonal teenagers. They’re like, “Hey, Mexico.” [audience laughs] “Respect our boundaries.” [audience laughs] Then there’s a bunch of Mexican uncles at the border. They’re like, “Señor, why is the door locked?” [audience laughs] [speaks in Spanish] “Why is the door locked? Esta es mi casa.” “Don’t ever lock the door!” World War III is about to pop off because disputes over what? Boundaries! Boundaries. That’s gonna be the downfall of Western civilization. Sunaad, do you know what our downfall will be? [man] What? Hoarding! [audience laughs] Our parents love to hoard. [man whoops] Everything, just fucking Subway napkins. Ha, ha! Taco Bell fire sauce. Red crushed pepper from Dominos.\\nJust poverty mentality.\\n[audience cheering and whooping] Go into any immigrant household. Go to the drawer next to the spoons. [audience cheering and whooping] “Why do you have six kilos of Parmesan cheese… [audience laughs] …from Round Table Pizza?” “You can take my green card, but you can’t take my Parmesan cheese!” [man whoops] Not only do our parents physically hoard, they emotionally hoard. [audience laughs] Oh, every grievance, every trauma. Right here. Right here. Every time you fuck up, “I’ll remember.” They never clear cookies and cache. [audience laughs] My parents, they’ve been together 40 years. Okay, they’ve been adjacent for 40 years. [audience laughs] I’ve never seen them hug. I’ve never seen them kiss. They’re just planking in their stubbornness. Just, “Fuck you!” “No, fuck you!” “Fuck you!” “You die!” “No, you die, that way I get the house and I can talk shit about you to the grandkids!” I had to have an intervention. I go, “Mom, Dad!” “You clearly don’t like each other.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You obviously don’t love each other.” “So either get a divorce, or go to therapy.” And my dad’s like, “Hasan, I’m not paying someone $200… [audience laughs] …when we can argue in this kitchen for free.” [audience laughing and whooping] And now I’m in therapy. Because I don’t wanna end up like them. But here’s the thing, I don’t think it works. Do you have friends that are in therapy, but they’re still shitty people? All my friends that are therapied up are the most mentally ill people that I know. They’ve just learned fancy words to avoid accountability. I have a friend that still owes me money for a concert. I tried to call him on it. I was like, “Scott, you owe me $350.” He’s like, “I hear you.” [audience laughs] “I receive you.” “But I don’t have the bandwidth.” I’m like, “Dammit, Scott!” Get more bandwidth. [audience laughs] Look, therapy’s important, but it is not a flex. Stop bragging about it. “I’m doing the work.” “I’m unpacking my tru…” I don’t need you to unpack. I need you to change.\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\nYou know what it is? Therapy has to be like a haircut. You can’t tell us about it. We have to notice the difference. [audience laughing and whooping] Listen, man, I’m telling you from experience, I’ve done it all. Don’t waste your money. I’ve done it all. I’ve done all the therapies. CBT. Couples therapy, immersive therapy. Let me just say this, okay? If you go to therapy, you deserve a therapist that understands you culturally. [audience cheering] Because I’ve had all the therapists, okay? I had Janet, okay? Janet didn’t cut it. [audience laughs] Janet, big-scarf energy. Buddha statue. She’s never been to Asia. I was her little anthropology experiment. She’s like, “Interesting, fascinating. This is like a trip to the Orient.” “You know, Hasan, every time we’re in a session and your phone goes off and it says ‘Mom cell, ‘ ‘Dad… ‘ You have this need to pick up.” You go, “boop.” “Why?” “Why?” “Can we talk about boundaries?” [audience laughs] And I’m like, “Janet, shut the fuck up.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nYou guys are individualists. We’re collectivists. How do I get you to understand where I’m coming…? “Okay, Janet, pretend this doesn’t say ‘Mom cell.'” “Pretend it says ‘dog cell.'” “Can I pick up?” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Of course!” I’m like, “What’s up, dog? You good?” “Oh my God, Janet, My dog needs insulin.” “Should I give her insulin or establish boundaries?” She goes, “What kind of dog?” “A goldendoodle.” “Not your goldendoodle!” I go, “I know.” [laughing] Oh! I see the dog people are in their feelings right now. [laughs] Oh, shit. My buddy Prashanth told me, he’s like, “Hasan, do not do the dog material on Netflix.” “Dogs are sacred in America.” “Talk about something less controversial, like the Middle East.”\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\n[laughs] But it’s not… No! It’s insane. It’s fucking insane. There are… “I love my dog.” “My dog is a member of my family.” You people are out of your fucking minds. “But you don’t… you don’t get it.” “You don’t get it.” “Once you lock eyes…” No, no, no, I get it. The only reason why you love your dog is because you’re never in trouble with your dog. You’re a piece of shit, and your dog is too dumb to know that you’re a piece of shit. [audience laughing and whooping] You love your dog. And you love your mom. But only one of them gets to live in your home. [audience laughs] Oh, ho-ho, but best believe the day your dog is able to talk, and it’ll happen in our lifetime… [audience laughs] …and he’s like, “Hey!” “Why are your pillowcases so dirty?” [audience laughs] You’ll be like, “Chauncey… boundaries.” [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] What was I expecting? Why the fuck was I listening to Janet give me opinions on how to deal with immigrant parents? We fired Janet. “Janet, you’re out.” “Jithra, you’re in.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nNow we have a South Asian therapist. She gets it. Jithra’s downloaded all the seasons of our culture’s trauma, okay? She knows all the baggage we wanna get rid of. She knows all the heirlooms we wanna pass on. She knows that we’re building a new future for our kids. I remember in one of our sessions, like ten minutes in, she cut me off, she goes, “Hasan, I know what’s wrong. I’m not supposed to, but I’ll tell you.” I go, “Jithra, this is what the fuck I’m talking about!” “You know we love shortcuts.” “Be direct. Talk to me.” She goes, “I don’t know if anyone’s told you this, Hasan, but you’re pretty manic.” “Now, you have something that the eldest child in every family from Beige-istan has.” [woman] Whoo! “The eldest child always has something called, ‘Good kid syndrome.'”\\n[audience whooping and applauding]\\n“The eldest child of the family feels like they have to take care of everybody in the family.” “Oh, Mom needs this.” “Oh, but your dad needs this.” “Your sister said this, but your brother did that.” “Your aunt’s doing this, but your uncle did this.” “And you feel like you have to plug every hole.” “But you’re always one hole behind.” [audience laughs] And I go, “That’s how I feel.” [audience laughs] “You probably feel really anxious around your loved ones.” “I feel so anxious.” [audience laughs] “You probably have a lot of secrets.” I go, “I have so many secrets.” “Dark secrets.” I go, “They’re fucking dark, Jithra.” “Now, if you wanna cast a light on that darkness, we really need to talk about your kinks.” [audience laughs] What? “What are your kinks, Hasan?” We don’t talk about this in Beige-istan. Individual pleasure. BDSM, sadism, voyeurism, torture, humiliation. [imitates whip cracking] Whipping. “What’s your kink?” And I… Acceptance. [audience laughs] That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I don’t want a ball gag.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nI don’t want latex. Just put me in a padded room with my wife and my dad, and have them gently whisper in my ear. “Hey, big boy.” “Guess what?” “No one is mad at you.” [audience laughs] And I will cream my pants. This is my wife’s kink, all right? We’re in a padded room. My dad’s not there. [audience laughs] And I whisper in her ear. And I go, “Hey, babe.” “Guess what?” “When my mom is old and decrepit, I won’t let her live with us.” [audience laughs] [Hasan] Ho, ho! I see a lot of women clapping! Really? Really? I thought we were the good progressives. I thought we support all women. Except my mother-in-law. Fuck that bitch! Really? That’s where our beautiful collective spirit dies. It dies at mother-in-law? Dude, I’m in the session. My wife’s kink is boundaries. I go, “Babe, we cannot have this.” “I know my parents are insane, but we cannot do this.” “Let’s not even be progressive. Let’s be practical.” “If we kick our parents out and our kids see it… [audience laughing] …we might be the first Indian homeless people in America.”\\n[audience whooping]\\nBecause best believe 40 years from now, we’re both gonna be built like gulab jamuns. I’ll have diabetes. Both of our knees are gonna be replaced. I’ll have the CPAP machine. I’ll be 80. Thinking about running for president. Imagine this. Think about it. In 40 years, what if we show up with the CPAP machine and the cane? What if we show up to our son’s door and he’s got a chain on the door? [imitating ragged breathing] Just like, “Oh.” “Oh, hey, Mom, Dad, what up?” [imitating ragged breathing] “What up?” “Son, can we die in your home?” “Oh, Dad!” “Dad, this is a bad time, Dad.” “See, I’m dating this girl from Palo Alto, and we’re in couples therapy, and the therapist says we should establish boundaries, especially with our mothers.” If my son said that about my wife, I would fucking kill that kid. I would run to the car. I’d get a gun. I would blow that fucking door down. I’d go, “Get on the fucking ground, you ungrateful piece of shit!” He’d be like, “Oh my God, Dad, where did you get that gun?” “I got a gun for this joke, you idiot. Don’t fact-check comedy.” “Listen to me, we gave you everything.” “We got rid of all of our baggage. “We gave you every heirloom.” “We still go to therapy. We still fuck.” “You have any idea what you did to your mother’s hips? I love them.” “But you destroyed your mother’s hips, so guess what?” “She gets to die in your fucking house.” “And how many times do I have to tell you this?” “In Beige-istan, we never lock the door.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[“On My Way” playing]\\n♪ Don’t you slow down ♪ ♪ Don’t you look down We’re at new heights now ♪ ♪ All on my feet and my heart… ♪ San Jose, thank you so much.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.”\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!”\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.”\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.”\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!”\\n♪ A whole new world ♪\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.”\\nI’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!”\\nI don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore.\\nI’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.”\\nI can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody.

Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not.\\nI love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it.\\nI love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all.\\nNow, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny.\\nNow, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits…\\nDo you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do.\\nI of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot.\\nYeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it.\\nI once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me.\\nI hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it.\\nI get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday?\\nI had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets.\\nYou guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans.\\nI assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them.\\nI like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end.\\nMan, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing.\\nLast year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.”\\nI never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony.\\nYou. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky.\\nThe other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend.\\nI’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them.\\nYou guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny.\\nI think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink.\\nYou’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking.\\nI’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer?\\nIt’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich.\\nAnd who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.”\\nMy grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on.\\nBut I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.”\\nThank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself.\\nI like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?”\\nNo. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand?\\nNow I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.”\\nThis might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAnthony Jeselnik, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t4 thoughts on “Anthony Jeselnik: Thoughts And Prayers (2015) – Full Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuca 20/02/2022 at 01:56  \\n\\n\\nThis man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAriel 30/03/2022 at 06:11  \\n\\n\\nExcept for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.

Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part.\\nThe, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore.\\nSo February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know.\\nLet me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen.\\nLike, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just…\\nThis is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.”\\nI really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.”\\nThis is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good.\\nSo… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense.\\nSo… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening.\\nTwo years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.”\\nAs the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.”\\nSo I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love.\\nThree weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.”\\nThe point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.”\\nYou could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!”\\nSo we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.”\\nSo… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.”\\nSo we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.”\\nAt this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her.\\nI get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me.\\nThe next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.\\nThank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much!

Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people?\\nI had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit.\\nWe learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud.\\nYou don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if it’s you living another life.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nI mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em.\\nWe live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump.\\n[man 2] No. Boo!\\n“No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense.\\nNobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that.\\nThe White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is.\\nWell, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.”\\nHow’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles]\\nThe whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?”\\nObama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs]\\nYou know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole combo attractor. It’s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes.\\nI saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.”\\nEveryone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it.\\nI watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that.\\nOh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a good cult.\\nSome cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this isn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird.\\nBecause when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike.\\nAnd that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.”\\nThat’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs]\\nI have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses]\\nIt’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom! Go to bed!” [audience laughing]\\nJokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school.\\nMy daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly.\\nDebbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents.\\nSo out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful.\\nBut there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, “An open letter to Jennifer Lopez… Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “Let me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck!\\nThis is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure.\\nIs this what we wanted? I don’t know.\\n[woman] No!\\nNo.\\n[woman] No!\\nAre you sure?\\n[woman] No!\\nWhy are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom?\\nWhat’s happening?\\n[woman 2] No!\\nAre you White Panthers? What is this?\\n[man] Life sucks!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are you saying?\\n[man] Life can kind of suck sometimes.\\nLife can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!”\\nWhen you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit?\\nNo one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’ll do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.”\\nBut I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect!\\nWe’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out!\\nAn American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nThank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys.

I was out by nine, n*gga. “Somethin’ don’t look right, n*gga.” “It’s slippery in here, n*gga.”\\n[crowd gasps and laughs]\\nAtlanta saved my life.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nThe internet tried to kill me.\\nKatt Williams!\\n[audience jeers]\\nKatt Williams got in on it. Did y’all see the special? Katt Williams said he knew. [imitating Katt] “Jamie Foxx got so much money.” “They say he’s sufferin’ from a mystery illness.” “A mystery illness?” “What the ♪ Fuck?” ♪\\nThat shit sound just like that, n*gga.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nThat n*gga said… “Goddamn, that sound… [imitating Katt, dramatically] …a mystery illness.” “What the fuck?” [scoffs] That n*gga turned into the Wicked Witch of the West. [imitates Wicked Witch] “A mystery illness.” “I’ll get you my little Jamie and your little dog Toto too.” [cackles]\\n[crowd laughs]\\nKatt will say 2,000 things that don’t make sense, right? But then say four things that make sense and put “sir” after it. “The glass is half full, sir. I just filled it to the top, sir.” [crowd laughs] “Man goes to bed with an itchy ass, he wakes up with a smelly finger, sir.” [audience chuckles] [Jamie] I know, man. Y’all know me, man. And I’m so glad to see y’all here. I’m so glad to be here. [audience cheers] This is what I needed, man. You got a lot of people that prayed to make sure I was here.\\n[audience] Yes.\\nYes. And I appreciate every prayer, man. Now, what’s interesting is Katt Williams might be onto something. Because it is a mystery. [clicks tongue] We still don’t know exactly what happened to me. [sighs] All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer. Because I needed… every prayer. I appreciate every well-wish, Atlanta. Uh… to the world, I… I can’t thank you enough, even when I see people on the street, and they roll their window down and yell out, “Man, we glad you here.” As I look out, and I see my family and I… see my friends. [clicks tongue] I can’t tell you how good it feels. If you could see it through here… it feels amazing.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nIt actually happened here in Atlanta. A little history, Atlanta, I started doing stand-up comedy back in 1991, right here in Atlanta. So it’s fitting that I came back here to tell you, uh, the story because… what had happened was… [clicks tongue] [sighs, exhales deeply]\\n[sniffles]\\n[woman 1] We love you.\\n[woman 2] Atlanta saved your life.\\nHey, hello. You did. [crying] Wow. Man, please, Lord. Let me get through this. [crowd cheers]\\nPlease.\\n[woman 3] All right, you got it! You got it! [cheering continues] April 11th, I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for a aspirin, and I realized quickly that when you in a medical emergency, your boys don’t know what the fuck to do. And I was like, “Damn.” But I was having such a bad headache. So, I asked my boy, I said, “Listen, I need a… a… a aspirin.” Before I could get the aspirin… [ominous tones play] [clicks tongue] …I went out. [sniffles] [music fades] I don’t, um… I don’t remember 20 days.\\n[woman 1] Oh, man.\\n[audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What they told me was, was that… [clicks tongue]…they took me to the first doctor. And that doctor just gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home. [crowd murmurs] Yeah, I don’t know… What the fuck is that? [crowd chuckles] I don’t know if you can do Yelps… [audience chuckles] …for doctors, man. That’s half a star, n*gga. [audience laughs] You know? “No, he good. Give him that.” Man, what the fuck? But my sister… said, “No.” [woman] All right. Four foot 11… of nothin’ but pure love said that something’s wrong with my brother. She came over to see me, and I was… They told me I was leth… lethargic. And she says, “Get him in the car. That ain’t my brother right there.” My little sister who’s always played the background, now gotta play the lead. [man] Amen. [inhales sharply] They say she drove around Atlanta, sorta aimlessly. She didn’t really know where the hospitals was. But as she was drivin’ around, she came up on Piedmont Hospital. Give it up for Piedmont. [crowd cheering] What’s interesting about it is that as she drove around, she didn’t know anything about Piedmont Hospital, but she had a hunch that some angels is in there.\\n[woman 1] Mm-hmm.\\n[crowd murmurs in agreement] ‘Cause she said, “That’s what we gon’ need.”\\n[scattered applause]\\n[man 1] All right. [woman 2 whoops]\\n[man 2] Yes!\\n[woman 3] Hallelujah!\\n[woman 4] Love you.\\nLove you.\\n[woman 5] Atlanta saved your life!\\nAtlanta saved my life. [crowd cheering] So they tell me my sister took me into the hospital. And this cool white boy, Dr. Schuette… Cool white boy. They say he had on a Laker jersey. Just cool as shit, you know? But… he told my sister some horrible news about… her big brother. He said… “He’s havin’ a brain bleed…\\n[audience murmurs]\\n[Jamie sighs] …that’s led to a stroke.” [clicks tongue] Damn. [emotionally] Me. Me, man. Me. [softly] Wow. Here’s the thing. When you dream about what you want to be in life, you don’t dream tragedy.\\n[crowd] No.\\nYou dream everything is good. “I… I got the life. I got the cars.” “I got all that.” [sniffles] You don’t dream that something would go wrong. But when something does go wrong… you need a sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nFour foot 11.\\n[crowd] Mm-hmm.\\nFull of nothin’ but love.\\n[audience cheers and applauds] [sighs, sniffles] The cool doctor with the Laker jersey, white dude, said, “Listen.” “He’s havin’ this brain bleed that led to a stroke, and if I don’t go in his head right now, we’re gonna lose him.” [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What I was told was my sister fired right back and said, “You can go in his head, but you ain’t gonna find nothin’.” [audience laughs] He said, “Why you say that?” She said, “Have you seen how big this n*gga’s head is?” [audience laughs] My sister made a joke because sometimes you gotta laugh…\\n[crowd] To keep from crying.\\n…to keep from cryin’.\\n[crowd murmurs in agreement, applauds]\\n[cheering]\\nWhat actually happened was the doctor said, “If I don’t go in his head, we’re gonna lose him, and she fired back and said, “You can go in his head, but you’re not gonna find anything ’cause I already talked to God.”\\n[woman 1] That’s right.\\n[crowd cheers] The cool white doctor, named Dr. Schuette, shot right back and said, “I’m a religious man too.”\\n[woman 2 whoops]\\n[woman 3] All right. But I gotta do my job. [woman 3] All right. So, what I was told is that they take me in to operate on me, and, uh, my sister knelt down outside the operating room and prayed the whole time. [woman 3] All right. [quietly] Your life doesn’t flash before your face. It was kinda… oddly peaceful. I say this all the time. I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. I didn’t see the light. [audience chuckles] I was in a tunnel, though. It was hot in that tunnel.\\n[woman 1] Ooh!\\n[audience murmurs and chuckles] [laughing] [audience murmurs] Shit, am I goin’ to the wrong place in this motherfucka? ‘Cause I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the devil.\\nLike, “Come on, n*gga.”\\n[audience chuckles] Or was that Puffy?\\n[audience gasps and laughs]\\n[Jamie] I’m fuckin’ around. But if it was Puffy, he had a flamin’ bottle of Johnson &… No, I’m just kiddin’. [imitating Puffy] “Come on in!” No, I’m just kidding. [laughter dies down] No, I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. [clicks tongue] But my sister… [sniffles] …prayed the whole time. And when that cool white dude… [sniffles] …Dr. Schuette came out, he said, “Well, um, you was right.” “Your prayers are answered. We didn’t find where it was comin’ from.” “But he is havin’ a stroke.” “He may be able to make a full recovery.” “But it’s gonna be the worst year of his life.” [sniffles] That’s what it was, Atlanta. You finally got the story.\\n[man] Amen.\\n[clicks tongue]\\n[woman] Saved your life!\\nSaved my life. [crowd cheers] That’s why this moment is the most incredible moment. ‘Cause you do take it for granted. [sniffles] But I’mma tell you something about my sister, Deidra Dixon, and my daughter Corinne Marie Foxx. [dramatically] They held me the fuck down! [audience cheers] “Nobody sees him!” They cut it all off. [crowd cheers] They held it down. They didn’t want you to see me like that. I didn’t want you to see me like that.\\nI want you to see me like this.\\n[crowd] Yeah! [audience cheers] There’s another reason too why my daughter didn’t want nobody to see me ’cause I was dizzy from the… the stroke. I was so dizzy. So, my head would do this.\\n[crowd laughs]\\nStop… Stop laughing. Laugh. Go ahead, n*gga. I understand. But she says, “They gon’ meme the fuck outta this motherfucker.” [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I was doing that. [laughs] But now I have a better appreciation when I see people out and they doing this. I be like, “Oh, I know what that is. What’s up?” [crowd laughs] “What’s up with you?” “What’s up? Just chillin’.” “Just hangin’ out. What’s new?” I know. It’s fucked up, right? [audience chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles die down]\\n[woman] You look good!\\n[Jamie] Thank you so much. I feel good.\\n[audience cheers]\\nTwenty days I don’t remember. [sniffles]\\nBut on May 4th…\\n[crowd] Yeah? I woke up. [snaps] [crowd cheers] And when I woke up, I found myself in a wheelchair.\\nI couldn’t walk.\\n[audience groans] Couldn’t walk, bro. In a wheelchair, and I was like, “What the fuck is…?” “Why am I in a wheelchair?” I’m just coming out of some shit. I looked at Dave Brown. I said, “What am I doin’ in a wheelchair?” He said, “Foxx, you don’t remember?” “No! Why?” “What y’all doin’?” He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” [clicks tongue] “Dave, knock it off. Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.”\\n[audience chuckles]\\nHe said, “You don’t remember?” “I don’t remember, but I know Jamie Foxx ain’t got no stroke.” “‘Cause I’m Jamie Foxx. Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” “And don’t try to get out of that chair, ’cause you can’t walk.” I said, “N*gga…” [hesitates] “Shit!” [audience laughs] “What the fuck you do to my legs, Dave?” I said, “Dave…” [splutters] “What’s going on, man?” He said, “Foxx, it’s real.” “Come on, Dave, man. That’s a horrible joke.” [man 1] You right! I said, “Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [sighs] [crying] “It’s a bad joke, Dave.” [sniffles] “I don’t get strokes. Come on, man.” [audience murmurs sympathetically]\\n[man 2] We love you, man.\\nI love you back. [audience cheers] [quietly] “I don’t get strokes. I don’t get strokes.” “That’s old man shit, man. I don’t get no strokes, n*gga.” Stop this fucking… prank. [sniffles] [clicks tongue, sniffles] They flew me to Chicago for my rehab. Chi-town. [audience cheers] Right there. They took care of me. Shirley Ryan, right over there. [audience cheering] Took care of me. [clicks tongue] But when I got to the rehab, there was this lady that was all over me. She was all over me, brushin’ my teeth, and… and… and… and washing my face, fixin’ my clothes, pushin’ my wheelchair.\\nAnd I’m like, “Damn…” [mumbles]\\n[audience laughs] “Who is this bitch all over me, man?” “She all over me, n*gga. She all over me, n*gga.” I said, “Dave, is she a fan? Did she see Django? Like, what? Shit.” “Why she all over me like this, dawg?” And Dave says something that stopped me in my tracks. He says, “Foxx, that’s your nurse.” I said, “What kind of old man shit is that?” So, the first night, she says, “Okay. Time for the showers.” I say, “Okay. Somebody put me in the chair, get me to the water, I’ll knock it out.” She says, “No, I’m gonna bathe you.” I said, “No, the fuck you ain’t.” She says, “Well… “I say, “No, no, no.” “You not finna… No. You not finna see this pickle.” [audience laughs] She said, “What you mean?” I say, “Uh-uh. It’s…” “Why?” I said, “No. ‘Cause there’s shit goes along with this pickle.”\\n“I’m Black.”\\n[audience laughs] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “It’s a whole lot of shit goin’ on here with this pickle.” “I just can’t let you see this pickle just on… out the package that quick.” [audience laughs] I said, “There’s something wrong with it. I don’t know if it’s been cold.” Fellas, you know how it is. You don’t ever take your pants off right away in front of your girl. You gotta… pump some oil in that motherfucker. Your girl… Ever pull your drawers up? “Bitch. Hold on!” [crowd laughs] “What’s wrong?” “Ain’t nothin’ in this motherfucker yet.” And that shit be stuck to your thighs. She’s like, “Are you okay?” “No! You got to give me a three count.” [audience laughs] “Give me a three count before you expose my pickle like that.” I gotta… You know… That bitch… Even if we ain’t finna fuck, it gotta have a certain… [inhales sharply] So, I’m sayin’ this to the lady. I said, “You can’t see my pickle,” and she hit me with some crazy shit. She said, “J, you don’t remember, do you?” “What?” “I’ve been bathing you for the past month and a half.”\\n[audience exclaims, laughs]\\n[imitating Katt Williams] I said, “Mystery illness?” [audience laughs] “What the fuck?” She been bathing me for a month and a half. I said, “You been in there?” She says, “All in there.” Goddamn! – “All in there?”\\n[emphatically] “Yes, all in there.” [inhales sharply] Fuck! That affected me more than the stroke.\\nI’m like, “Damn, is my dick dead?”\\n[crowd laughs] “Because I need my dick!” [audience laughs] But, yeah. She said she’d been all in there, and then I asked a silly question. I said, “Well, was I representin’?” [audience laughs] She says, “I don’t know what that means.” She don’t, but we know what that means, right, brother? I’m like, “Fuck!” [inhales sharply] “Shit!” “She’s seen it!” “And I don’t remember her seein’ it!” So it hit me. I ain’t seen my dick in 20 days. So I rush to the bathroom, pull my pants down, look down. That motherfucker had a stroke too. [audience laughs] I said, “Man, what’s wrong, n*gga?” “You tell me, n*gga, what’s wrong?” “What happened?” “I don’t know. The lights went off.” [audience laughs] “You cool?” “No, I ain’t cool!” “Did you see the nurse?” “I seen the bitch. I didn’t do nothin’.” [audience laughs] Uh… [chuckling] [clicks tongue] Then it was the process of the therapist. They’d bring therapists for my therapy, and I didn’t want to hear that shit. I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need no fuckin’ therapists. Why did this shit even happen to me? I’m Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx. So, every therapist that came in, I said, “Get the fuck out.” “I don’t want to do this shit.” I… I… I felt like, uh, Wesley Snipes in New Jack City. When he was at the table at the end and Gee Money would walk up. [as Gee] “Yo, you, Nino.” [as Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] “Huh.” “Is that what this is about? Over a fucking skeezer?” “I don’t give a shit about that ho bitch.” [crowd laughs] [scoffs] “Yeah, yeah.” “Don’t nobody know nothing, huh? Hmm, well, I’ll be goddamned.” “Huh. Hmm. Ha. Huh.” [audience laughs] [as Gee] “If you’d have been…” [as Nino] “What?” “If I’d have been what?!” “That’s what I thought you said. ‘Cause that’s all I got.” “Nothin’!”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n“Now, leave me.” [imitating Gee] “Yo, Nino.” [imitating Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] That’s my movie. [chuckles] Remember the old dude? [imitating Bill Cobbs] “Your soul is required in hell, young man.” “Look at you in here, sellin’ drugs to your own people.” [chuckles, imitating Nino] “Cancel this bitch. I’ll buy me another one.” “Sit your five-dollar ass down…” [crowd] “Before I make change!” [Jamie] That’s my audience. That’s Atlanta! Huh. Yeah. [crowd cheers] I was Wesley Snipes. I was arrogant. “I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need nothin’. I don’t want to see no therapist.” They say, “You got a second chance.” “I don’t want a second chance.” “What’s wrong with my first chance?” What’s wrong with my first chance? So, I was… irreverent. I was… I gave up. [sniffles] Then… I heard in the other part of the room… I heard ’em go, “We need Holly.” [audience chuckles] Who the fuck is that? “We need Holly for this one. Only Holly can get him goin’.” “Holly is the one.” I’m like, “I don’t give a fuck about no Holly.” “She gon’ get the same shit.” “And she comin’ here on that bullshit.” You know them movies, “It’s only one person could do this.” “We gotta get Holly.” I’m like, “Man, bull-Holly.’\\n[sniffles]\\n[audience laughs] I’m layin’ in my bed. That’s all I could do every day. I could walk a little bit, but I couldn’t walk. So it’s early in the morning. I hear, “Get up!” Goddamn! “I’m Holly, motherfucker!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[woman] Oh, damn. I said, “Hey, Holly.” [imitating Holly] “Yes, listen. You gotta knock this shit off.” “This whole Jamie Foxx shit.” “Stop this arrogant bullshit.” “That stroke doesn’t give a fuck about who you are.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker.”\\n[audience cheers]\\n[woman] Go, Holly! “All of this ‘I’m Jamie Foxx’ and this Wesley Snipes shit you’re doin’.” “New Jack City.” “Fuck that city.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, and I can get you there, but you gotta tell me the truth and cut this ‘Jamie Foxx’ shit.” I say, “Yeah, miss lady, I’m good.” “Oh, you good?” “You can beat this?” I say, “Yeah.” “Walk to me now.” I said, “Yeah…” [audience chuckles] [woman 1] Aww. [woman 2] Oh. [man] Damn, bro. She said, “I can help you, Jamie Foxx.” [sniffles] “But you gotta tell me what’s really goin’ on with you.” “You’re dizzy, right?” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” “You’re so dizzy, you can’t walk.” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” She says, “You remember the movie Karate Kid?” I say, “Yes.” She said, “We gonna wax on… [with audience]…wax off.”\\n[audience cheers]\\nI said, “What that mean?” She says, “I’m gonna help you with that so you can go back to bein’ a man.” She said, “Take your right hand, and put it on your left shoulder.” “Your left hand on your right shoulder. Now close your eyes.” And I fell. She picked me back up. “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “I want you to look left, and I want you to look right.” I look left. I look right. I fell. She said, “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “This is it. Look left and look right.” I look left. I look right. I got that. And then she said, “Now, Jamie Foxx, now you got that? I want you to look up and look down.” I look up, look down, I got dizzy. I fell back in my bed, and I said, “Miss Holly, I don’t want to do this no more, man.” “What has happened to me?” [shakily] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “I don’t want to do this.” And she said, “I got 15 more minutes left.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, motherfucka.”\\n[applause]\\n[woman] Holly! “You look left, and you look right.” I looked left, right. She said, “Go to sleep!” [snores] [crowd laughs] The next mornin’… “Get up!” Goddamn, bitch. You gotta get a bell around your neck or somethin’. [audience laughs] She said, “Look left, look right.” Huh? “Look up! Look down!” I said, “Yeah.” “You gotta kill that old Jamie Foxx in order for the new Jamie Foxx to walk outta here.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience cheers] Next morning came, Holly came in. I was already out of bed. “Hey, bitch.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I knew you was coming, bitch. I’m up!” “Knock it the fuck off.” “Left, right, up, down. Get the fuck outta here.” So I got down again, and Holly took me into the big facility, but there’s other patients in there, and I was down in the dumps. She says, “What’s your fuckin’ problem?” “What is your problem? You don’t want to fight?” She said, “Jamie, when you walk in this facility, look to the left of you, people that ain’t gonna get outta here.”\\n[audience groans]\\nAnd I did. I looked… There was a quadriplegic. There was a person in a wheelchair. There was another guy’s whole side was gone. She said, “They not gettin’ outta here.” There was one little white lady. All she could do was… turn this little pinwheel. She said, “What do you think now?” And I wept. Cryin’. I said, “God, to all the blessings, go over there.” [man] Yes. [Jamie crying softly] So, then they called my… my psychiatrist, Dragana. He knew I was going through some shit. He says, “What’s goin’ on with you? Why can’t we just talk it out?” I said, “Dragana, we can’t, man, ’cause I’m angry.” “I don’t know why this is happenin’ to me.” And as I said that, I knew why this was happenin’ to me.\\nIt was God.\\n[woman] There it is. [gently] It was God. It was God. I talked to him different. I was like, “Hey, man. You sure you got the right dude?” He says, “Who’s this?” I say, “It’s Foxx!” “Who?” “Foxx!” “Come on, G, it’s J!” “Foxx! Jamie Foxx.” “The one down here puttin’ smiles on people’s faces.” “Who?” I said, “Damn. You want my government name? Eric Bishop.” [audience laughs] “Terrell, Texas? The one that beat the odds, that got the Oscars?” “The one that got the Grammys? C’mon, G. It’s J.” “Come on, man!” He said, “What’s up, my n*gga?” [audience laughs] You can tell by that phrase alone that God is not white.\\n[crowd laughs]\\n‘Cause I wouldn’t even let the Messiah call me that. That’s how me and God talk. I said, “Damn, man, you sure? Why am I going through this?” “Is it a clerical error?” “Did Peter write down the wrong name? I mean, did you read it wrong?” “I’m not sayin’… I’m just sayin’, you been at this for a while.” “Maybe you just… read that shit wrong, my n*gga.” [crowd chuckles] He said, “No. This should be happenin’ to you.” I said, “What? Why?” I said, “God, look at all these bad people.” [crowd murmurs] “Look at all these bad people down here.” “Shouldn’t these bad people be goin’ through this?” You know what he said? “Those bad people already belong to somebody else.” [audience exclaims and murmurs] “You belong to me.”\\n[crowd cheers and applauds]\\n“Remember when you used to say your grace before you ate your food?” “You belong to me.” “Remember when you played the piano for the church?” “When’s the last time you been to church, my n*gga?” [audience exclaims]\\n[man] Mm.\\n[woman] Mm! But I shot back, “God, I get it.” “But the crime don’t fit the punishment.” [crowd laughs] “The crime don’t fit… I’m serious!” “This is too much on me. I’m still down here. I’m gregarious.” “I’m makin’ people laugh, making ’em have fun.” I said, “But look, what this is doin’ to my family, God.” I said, “Look what it’s doing to my kids.” And you know what he said? “You see what they did to my kid?” [audience exclaims]\\n[applause]\\n[woman] Heavy. I gave you two beautiful daughters. [man] Amen. That was my only… begotten son. [scattered applause] And then I said, “Man, why you bringing up old shit?” [audience laughs] As soon as I said it, I got dizzy. I said, “Okay, okay!” “G, come on, man! Come on. Knock it off, bro.” “C’mon, my n*gga. I’m just…” “Bro, I’m a kidder!” [chuckles] “Bro, I’m joking. Come one, man.” “Let me out this bitch. Come on, bro.” “I’m fuckin’ around, bro.” “Okay. I didn’t mean to say ‘fuckin’.” I’m foolin’.” “Just let up off me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd finally, it came to me. It’s about blessings.\\n[woman 1] Yes.\\n[woman 2] Right.\\nGod blessed me with this talent.\\n[man] Amen. He blessed me with all this money and this fame. And when I forgot about God… [woman 3] Mm! …he blessed me with a stroke.\\n[sound distorts]\\n[gentle piano music playing]\\n[crowd applauding]\\n[Jamie crying] Just give me one second.\\n[gospel singer] ♪ Change me, O God ♪ ♪ Make me more like you… ♪\\n[Jamie] Y’all know I couldn’t wipe my own ass?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[sweet tune fades slowly] [hushed] I couldn’t wipe my own ass. That’s what really got me at one point. I went from Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx to, “Okay, lean over.”\\n[crowd laughs]\\n“Okay, we’re gonna go in there.” I said, “Damn, y’all gotta go all the way?” Damn, this is… Oh, this is fucked. Ugh. I can’t wipe my own booty… Ass. [inhales sharply] I lost everything. But the only thing I could hold onto was… was my sense of humor. I never let that go. I couldn’t necessarily walk that good. I couldn’t talk that good. But I… But I didn’t let go of my funny. I said, “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” So I was always crackin’ jokes to the point to where the nurses thought I was really losin’ my mind. And I was never myself. Never myself. ‘Cause it’s a wellness check, they ask you who you are. For five days, I was Denzel Washington. I was Denzel. [as Denzel] “All right.” [chuckles] “All right, so that’s what you’re tellin’ me. Okay.” “All right.” [chuckles] “You gotta wipe my ass, huh? Okay.” “All right. Okay.” “That’s what you’re telling me. I had a stroke. Okay.” “All right. You gotta wipe my…” [chuckling] Ah. My nurses. My nurses. [chuckles] “So, you’re tellin’ me… That’s what you’re tellin’ me.” “You gotta wipe my…” “Okay, I’m gonna lean over. Okay. I’m gonna lean over.” [laughs] “I’m gonna lean over. Get on in. Okay. You goin’ too far.” “You get your fuckin’ hands off me!” [crowd applauds] “You think you can do this shit to me?!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You’ll be serving tapioca pudding in Pelican Bay when I’m done with you!” [audience chuckles] “You had a stroke, sir.” [with audience] “That stroke ain’t got shit on me!” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For three days, I was Dave Chappelle. [imitating Chappelle] “Damn, it’s crazy!” “I can’t believe I came in, they said, ‘Dave, you gone and had a stroke.\\'” “There’s no way Dave could have a stroke. I was incensed!” “Damn, there’s no way. I’m strong! Said they gotta wipe my ass.” “No way! I’m strong!” “Wu-Tang, n*gga! Pow!” [crowd laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For six days, I was Mike Tyson. [imitating Tyson] “I’m heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “Hello, I’m Mike Tyson. Heavyweight boxing champ of the world.” “Somebody told me I had a sthoke.”\\n[crowd laughs]\\n[as nurse] “Sir, it’s ‘stroke.\\'” [as Tyson] “No, ‘sthoke.’ I had a sthoke.” [as nurse] “You’re not saying it right.” [as Tyson] “I can say it however I want.” “Because I’m Mike Tyson, heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “So, I say, ‘sthoke.\\'” “You’re not gonna wipe my ass. Nobody’s goin’ near my culo.” [audience chuckles] “They said I had a sthoke.” “And I gotta fight, and I don’t care who I fight.”\\n“I’ll fight Logan Paul.”\\n[crowd laughing] “I’ll fight Jake Paul.” “I’ll fight RuPaul. I don’t care who it is I fight.” “Because I don’t get sthokes.” “I give sthokes.” “I be sthokin.\\'” “That’s what I be doin’.” [laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for like five days, I was Jay-Z.\\n[crowd exclaims]\\n[chuckles slightly, imitating Jay-Z] “Last night was crazy.” “It’s crazy. They told me I had an ailment.” “I said, ‘Impossible.\\'” [audience laughs] “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles slightly] “I started… started off in Marcy Projects, you know.” “Dame had an idea.” “Y’know, he said, ‘Well, you do music.\\'” “I said, ‘Great.\\'” “Then later, he came with the clothing line.” [restrained chuckle] “And then I met B.” [awkward, drawn-out laugh] “So, they told me I had an illness. I said, ‘Impossible.\\'” “They said, ‘Are you mad?’ I said, ‘No.\\'” “And then they said I need a bedpan.” “And I said, ‘I don’t do bedpans.\\'” “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles timidly] “And then I shit all over myself.” [audience laughs] [Jamie] “I said, ‘Oh, shit.” “I think I need a bedpan.” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for three days, I was this dude.\\n\\n\\n\\n[imitating Trump] “There’s lots of great nurses.” “Lots of great nurses. I see the Blacks.” “I like the Blacks.” “They’re hungry. They’re eating dogs.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“They’re eating pets! They’re eating dogs!” “They’re eating pets. I like the Blacks.” “The Haitians. Sak pase.” “Map boule. They’re eating dogs.” “I like all of the nurses. I like…” “I like the nurses. I like the nurses.” “I like ’em. They like me. I like them. I like the white nurses.” [emphatic] “I like the white nurses.” “I like the Black nurses.” “I like all of the nurses. The Black…” “I like… I have a huge, huge Black following.” “I got a huge… There’s a Black. There’s another Black.” “There’s another Black. Oh, Puerto Rican. Same shit.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I like Kamaya-maya.” “Kamaya-maya Harris.” “I love Kamaya-maya.” “What’s her name? Kamala! Kamala!” “I love Kamala. I love… I love… I love Kamala.” “I love Kamala. I love Kamala.” “She’s Black. She just turned Black. I don’t know where she was.” “She just became Black. She just… ‘Poof, I’m Black!\\'” “This is fine. If she wants to turn Black, she can turn Black.” “I like her because she’s Black and she’s Indian.” “I like that. I like it.” “She’s mixed. She’s Black. Hey, for real, though. And Indian.”\\n[imitating Native American chant]\\n[audience exclaims] [panting] If I can stay funny… [all]…I can stay alive. [crowd cheering] [Jamie clicks tongue] ‘Cause it was touch and go. [clicks tongue] It was touch and go. [clicks tongue] And they told me, uh… They said the first 15 days, they thought they were gonna lose me because my vitals were out of control. [imitates monitor beeping] They said, “We’re gonna lose him.” So it was a 13-or 14-day period where he says, “We gotta keep him calm.” “And we’ve given him every medication. It’s not workin’.” “We have to keep him calm.” “His vitals are so high, we’re gonna lose him.” You know what the worst thing to have when you tryin’ to stay calm in a hospital room? Black family members. [audience laughs] Aka, n*ggas. ‘Cause you know they come in with, “Oh, Lord!” “Good God Almighty!”\\n“Not my baby! Not now! Not now!”\\n[alert beeps] “Ooh, good God Almighty! Please save him, Jesus!” My Black family was goin’ so crazy, my white doctor said, “Hey, we need to keep these n*ggas outta here so he can stay alive.” I’m jokin’. He didn’t say that. Now, you know if I was to say that, that’s what TMZ would report.\\n[imitates news fanfare]\\n[imitating TMZ announcer] “Jamie Foxx said his white doctor had to call him ‘n*gga’ in order to stay alive.” That’s not what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. All right? He actually said, “Get these Black motherfuckers outta here.” No, I’m kidding. But it was real. My vitals were so bad, they were gonna lose me. And… that’s when a miracle happened, and that miracle was working through my youngest daughter. She’s 14. I didn’t want her to see me like that. But she snuck into my hospital room with her guitar. [crowd] Aww. And she says, “I know what my daddy needs.” [breathing shakily] She said, “That’s my daddy.” What’s interesting is my daughter used to carry her guitar all the time with her. And they said, when she was playing, my vitals… went down. The nurses at the nurses’ station were baffled. Like, “Wow, what did they give him?” So they rushed into the room, and she said, “Shh.” [softly] I got him. My daughter used to carry that guitar when she was ten years old. She would carry it everywhere. She carried it everywhere. I was like, “You gonna carry a guitar?” Going to Disneyland, she got that guitar. [crowd laughs] We going to a football game, she got that guitar. Everywhere we went, she had the guitar. But you know what I found out? It was God in that guitar.\\n[women] Yes.\\n[crowd applauds] God was in that guitar. That’s my spiritual defibrillator. [crowd] Aww. [crowd cheering] [woman] Aww! That’s Anelise.

I want to get through this ’cause every time I run into somebody now, that I haven’t seen in a while, I cry. ‘Cause y’all my people. You’ve known me for so long, so every time I run… Especially when I run into my homies. I ran into T.I., I cried. I think he kinda cried… But he was like… [as T.I.] “What you sayin’, my n*gga?” “What you sayin’ with me, partner?” “I pray for you, partner. Period.” “I pray for your partner. I pray for you. I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, partner.” “I prayed expeditiously for you, n*gga.” [audience laughing] But every time I run into somebody, I cry. I ran into T.I., I cried. I ran into Candice Parker, I cried. Then, somehow, I ran into Halle Berry. [audience exclaims] I didn’t cry as much.\\n[crowd laughs]\\n‘Cause Halle just rushed me and hugged me so tight. I was like, “Ooh, Lord, have mercy, Jesus.” “This here is Halle Berry.” And she don’t realize how fucking sexy she is. And I don’t want to blow the moment ’cause it was heartfelt. She said, “Jamie, oh my God!” And she hugged me. I said, “Ooh, oh, my gosh.” She said, “There’s so much I wanted to tell you.” And I said, “There’s so much I gotta tell you!” ‘Cause she was huggin’ me. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Please don’t let me disrespect this moment.” So I had to relay… ‘Cause the hug was so nice, I had to relay to my pickle. “Hey, stand down, n*gga. This ain’t that kind of hug.” He shot back, “Shit!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“N*gga, that’s Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” “Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” I’m like, “Man, don’t blow this for me, my n*gga. She’ll feel it!” “Please!” And she’s holding me. She’s talkin’ to me, this close to my ear. I said, “Goddamn!” She right here in my ear. I said, “Damn!” Know how women pretty like that always have a fragrance you’ve never smelled. That shit… I said… [sniffs] “Ooh, what the fuck is that?” “God, this smells like Heaven.” I said… [inhales] I took that shit in, and she was hugging me. I said, “Oh, God, please. Please stay with me, Lord. Please.” “Don’t let me fuck this moment up.” She hugged, and then she… As I tried to pull away, she hugged tighter. Oof. I said, “Good God Almighty.” [crowd laughs] And I could feel my hips. I said, “Hips! Hips, stop! Stop!” But I did just clench up to let her know I’m there.\\n[crowd laughs]\\nSo she’s huggin’ me, and I’m trying to get out of this moment, and as I’m trying to push away from her heartfelt sexual grip, I tried to push away, know what she did? She kissed me on my neck. [crowd exclaims] And n*gga, I came… [crowd exclaims] …to my senses! [crowd laughing] You nasty motherfuckers. Yo, man, I ain’t finna come like that with Halle. And as she was huggin’ me, “Oh my God, thank you so much.” So Halle, when you see this, please understand what I’m sayin’. You just so beautiful. That’s all we wanna say. Halle you’re beautiful. So she let me go. She let me out of her clutches. I said, “Thank you, Jesus!” But then, I felt a rumblin’. I felt something rumbling. I said, “Ooh, whee!” “I can’t wait.” So I rushed to the bathroom to see what was rumblin’. And I pulled my pants down, and I said, “Oh, shit!” “Somebody back!” [laughs] “Somebody back!” And then I ask him, “Hey, n*gga, what got into you?” Know what he said? “Sometimes, you gotta pop out and show n*ggas.”\\n[intense beat playing]\\n♪ We back!

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all.\\n“The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n“My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”\\n“The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n“Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.\\n“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”\\n“Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n“Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”\\n“Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”\\n“First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.\\n“Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!”\\n“Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.\\n“Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!”\\n“Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending.\\n“Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.\\n“If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n“Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

[audience laughs] [Keith laughs] Oh, I had two strokes, man. Two! Yeah. One more, I’m gonna be Mitch McConnell.\\n[audience laughing]\\nStaring all… [laughs]\\n[audience laughs] I gotta admit, man, the first stroke wasn’t shit. [audience laughs] I’m like, “What the fuck?” “You call this a stroke?” [audience laughs] Now, the second stroke, oh, shit! [audience laughs] “Now this is a stroke.” [audience laughing] Mwah! [audience laughing, clapping] Huh? That’s what I call “different strokes.” [audience laughs] I should be kicked off the stage for that shit. [audience laughs] [chuckles] There’s a lot of different strokes, there really are, man. This woman was on Investigation Discovery. Right? She had a stroke. And became a psychotic killer. I’m like, “Oh, fuck.” [audience laughs] “I gotta worry about that now?” I’m walking down the street, “Oh, shit.” “Oh, shit!” “Am I gonna murder?” [audience laughs] I couldn’t kill a bunny rabbit, what the fuck am I talking about, man? But everybody… every audience I go to people know somebody who had a stroke. Right? But they think they become stroke experts. ‘Cause they tell me, “Come here, man.” Like they selling me drugs or some shit. [audience laughing] “My Uncle Bill had a stroke.” “He took four cups of green tea with a tablespoon of Seemox.” [audience laughs] “After six months, no more stroke.” [audience laughs] You gonna get the fuck out of my face, man. [chuckles] I mean, I did it, I followed…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] It is a pain in the ass, man, this stroke shit. ‘Cause now it’s like it’s weird, man. I was in Philadelphia taking my grandkids boxing, you know what I mean? I was getting ready to try to park the car when a UPS truck drove and took my spot. My handicapped spot. [audience laughs] Now, when you’re handicapped, you become the Handicap Police. [audience laughs] I’m like, “What the fuck? Oh, no, you don’t.” [audience laughs] And I, like, beep the horn… [imitates honking] And I point to my placket. [chuckles] Like it’s a badge. I’m like… [audience laughing, clapping] He goes, “Get the fuck out of here.” Now I’m mad as shit, you know what I mean? I step out my car, close the door and lean against the car. I’m waiting for him to bring his ass back. I’m against the car trying to get my balance, you know what I mean? He gone come, I see him walking. “Come here for a minute.” He come on the right side. “No, could you move to the left a little bit?” [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Eh, ah! [audience laughs] I could do a one over on him, you know what I mean? [chuckles] A little slip and a turn, mmm! He’d beat my ass though, you know? [audience laughs] A lot of people ask me, “What did you learn from having a stroke?” Well, I learned, you know what I mean, to live in the moment. Live in the now.\\nNever… All right.\\n[audience claps, whoops] Never put off tomorrow what you can do today. In other words, if there is someone you wanna punch… [audience laughs] Punch them now! [audience laughing loudly] Knock the shit out of them! You know how many unpunched faces I left out there? [audience laughs] Oh, shit, these strokes is a pain in the ass, man. I don’t like it whatsoever, man, I’m like, “What the fuck?” You know what I mean? I’m brand new at this handicapped shit. I never was handicapped before, I’m brand fucking new. Only problem with that,\\nsometimes…\\n[cane thuds]\\nThere you go. [audience laughing, clapping] [audience whooping] Now, some of you are clapping like, “Oh, yeah, that’s all right,” while some of you are clapping like I’m at the Special Olympics. [audience laughs] “Come on, you can do it!” Mmm-mmm. Oh. [audience cheering] Hurry up, here… [audience laughing] …white girl. [laughs]\\nOh.\\n[audience cheering, clapping]\\nIt’s good to have friends, man. It’s very good to have friends. [audience cheering, clapping] You know, like, being handicapped, it’s my first time being handicapped. I never was handicapped ever. The only problem with that, sometimes I forget that I am handicapped, but I’m such an asshole… [audience laughs] …I find myself laughing at handicapped people. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? I see them walking, I’m like, “Ah!” [audience laughing] [chuckles] They’re like, “Look at you!” “Oh, shit.” “I forgot, man.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Y’all can laugh, don’t worry about me. [audience laughs] [chuckles] Now I got my trusty cane. It’s noisy as shit. You know what I mean? “Clunk! Clunk!” I gotta put tennis balls on the bottom to stop it being so fucking noisy, man. But it just, “clunk, clunk, clunk.” I’m walking through the Village, all the homeless guys are, like, “Who that new motherfucker?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m, like, “It’s me.” [chuckles] But all of a sudden, people think I’m homeless because I got a fucking cane. You know what I mean? An old white guy… I only have to tell what he did, but he’s white. [audience laughs] He shook his… [chuckles] …boxes of pizza at me. “Mmm?” [audience laughs] “I’m wearing a Tom Ford shirt, you motherfucker.” [audience laughing, clapping] “The hell out of my face.” [audience cheering, whooping] Eh? Well, people… [chuckles] Like, they really think I’m homeless, man. Like, this was last week. I’m walking there. Beautiful girl. She smile at me. I smile at her. I’m, like, “Oh, shit, here we go.” [audience laughs] This bitch… [audience laughs] …reaches in her bag. “Are you hungry, sir?” [audience laughs] “Would you like a sandwich?” “I don’t want no damn sandwich, I want some pussy!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nNo.\\nI didn’t say that. I did not say that.\\n[audience cheering, clapping]\\nI didn’t say it. I thought about it, but I didn’t say it. So I took her sandwich anyway. [audience laughing] [laughs] But usually I wouldn’t fuck with anybody, especially the comics. We’re comics. Anybody can mess with an old man. Ah. You know what I mean? I wasn’t voted the funniest guy in elementary, junior high school and high school because I said nice, encouraging shit. [audience laughs] I ain’t standing in front of a class, “Hey, leave the fat kid with the glasses alone!” [audience laughs] [laughs] [laughs] But everybody can mess with me. Anybody. Like, I see… Comics see stuff, we say certain things. We’re supposed to question the obvious. You know what I mean? Like today, in today’s world, man, like, kids, eight, nine years old, are telling their parents how they identify. What the fuck? [audience laughs] I can’t imagine my son coming to me at eight years old, “Dad, I think I wanna be trans.” “Oh, son, we can’t afford that right now.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “I just bought your ass a 60-pack of Fruit of the Loom, goddamn it!” [audience laughs] “We’re gonna try this boy shit at least three more years.” [audience laughs] [audience clapping] Oh, come on, man. That was not a transphobic joke. That was an economics joke. [audience laughs] Now this is a transphobic joke, right. [audience laughing] [chuckles] [chuckles]\\n[laughs]\\n[audience laughs] Well, everybody like, “Oh, man, you can’t say shit like that.” “You’ll be cancelled.” “God already cancelled my right side, man.” [audience laughs] “What more you want?!” [audience laughing, clapping] It’s all that social media shit, that’s the problem. Everybody yapping. It’s too much yapping. Everybody’s fucking yapping and yapping and yapping. Even so-called gangsters are yapping. “Yo, my name is OG Deathtrap. I shoot at the block.” “I pull bitches by the hair!” “If you like what I just said, hit that subscribe button for me.” [audience laughing, clapping] “Hit the subscribe butt…” What the fuck? [chuckles] But how I got over my stroke, man. I ain’t get over, but how, you know, I got through it. My religion. I believe in God.\\nYou know what I mean?\\n[audience cheers, claps] Any religious people out there? [audience cheers, claps] [laughs]\\nWow, that’s, like, 12 people.\\n[audience laughs] What the rest of you do? Go home and write manifestos? What the fuck? [audience laughing] What the hell? [laughs] Nah, man, I choose a religion with the best afterlife program. [audience laughs] Some religions have better afterlife programs. And some religions got real shitty afterlife programs. One religion you got… you get reincarnated and come back here. The fuck I’ma pick that shit, man. [audience laughs] What if I come back a white guy with a stroke, what the fuck, man? [audience laughs] Plus, I don’t fuck with any religion whose worship service don’t produce R&B singers. [audience cheers, claps] That’s for the Black folks. [audience laughs] You haven’t laughed at a damn thing I said so far, lady. Don’t look around, you! [audience laughs] She hates handicapped Black men, I’m sure of it. [audience laughing, clapping] [raucous laugh] What the fuck was that laugh? [audience laughs] [imitates raucous laughter] [continues imitating laughter] I see the Black… It looks good seeing Black folks smiling. You know, usually you go to a Black neighborhood, they be… [unintelligible] …face, [grunts]. [audience laughs] Black folks, we don’t get along, until we’re in an all-white country. [audience laughs] You’d be so happy to see another Black guy, he’d be a rival gang member, “Yo, my man!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] But I fuck with people, man. Nobody gave me a break when I was, um… when I had my stroke. None of my friends gave me a break. They kept fucking with me, man. I’ll never forget, I went to The Comedy Store, all right? And I go in there, and I’m with my cane, clunk, clunk, clunk. And I drop my cane, and I bent down to pick it up and that bitch, Amy Schumer… [audience laughing loudly] kicked my cane across the floor. [audience laughing loudly] Asshole Chris Rock calls me Stroky Robinson. [audience laughing loudly] That’s funny as shit, man. That is funny as shit! [audience laughs] That’s why I never understood why Jada Pinkett, who’s one of the most beautiful women in the world, got upset that he called her another beautiful woman. Demi Moore is beautiful. But, I know, womens, like, “Oh, no, she got alopecia.” Motherfucker, I had a stroke! [audience laughs] Alopecia is one step above having severe dandruff. [audience laughing] [laughs] [chuckles] That was pretty funny, man, come on. [audience laughs] I remember, like, I… When I had my stroke, I questioned God, man. I questioned God, I… “What did I ever do to deserve this stroke?!” “Oh, yeah, that’s right.” [audience laughing loudly] [audience clapping, whooping] “That time I hit that homeless guy and kept driving, fuck!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Was it the time I robbed those prostitutes?” [audience laughs] Oh, come on, man, come on! You know how many prostitutes robbed me? [audience laughing loudly, clapping] [audience whooping] Especially now! “Where you going? Ah, give my money… Ah, shit!” “At least bring back my cane.” [audience laughs] [laughs] No, but, like I said, when I got out of hospital, I went straight to Popeye’s Chicken, man. You know what I mean? The drive through. I wasn’t supposed to be driving, but fuck it. [audience laughs] That’s why I hit that homeless guy. [audience laughs] [Keith chuckles] Chicken fingers all over the place. [audience laughs] But y’all know, when you go to any drive through, when you can talk real clear, they barely understand you. [audience chuckles] [audience laughs] They got mad at me! [audience laughs loudly] [chuckles] The guy cursed at me. I’m, like, “Can I have…” “Sir, we don’t understand you.” “Well, could you please give me…” “Damn it! We don’t understand you!” And then I got mad. And when I get mad, I can talk real clear.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m, like, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] “You’re Popeye’s Chicken.” [audience laughs] “You sell nothing but chicken!” [audience laughing loudly, clapping] “Guess what I want?” [audience roars with laughter, claps] “It’s not like you have a variety of shit.” “Could I have the duck ravioli, please?” [audience laughs loudly] “Give me my three pieces and let me get the fuck out of here, man!” I know how I sound, man. You think I don’t know how I sound? I know. You know what I mean? My asshole grandson says I sound like Squidward. [audience roars with laughter] He’s a bitch-ass nigga, man, fuck him! [audience laughing loudly] [Keith chuckles] No, look, man, I love him, but I don’t like him. [audience laughs] He gone come at me on Father’s Day. Huh. “You know you’re not my favorite grandfather, right?” [audience laughs] [audience whooping] And I’m, like, “And you’re not my favorite grandson, asshole!” [audience laughs] He’s an asshole. [chuckles] I want to punch him right in the back of his head Soon as this hand gets better. [audience laughs] He don’t know, man. See, people… He don’t realize that my speech… When I first had my stroke, my… my second stroke, when I first had it, man, I wasn’t able to talk for two years. [audience] Aww… I’m lying, man, fuck it. [audience laughs] “Oh. Aww.”\\n[audience laughing loudly, clapping]\\nY’all dumb, little, old faces. “Oh! Oh, no, oh, no!” [chuckles] [laughs loudly] [audience laughs] Ah, that’s what y’all get for the fucking… No, my voice was fucked up, though. [chuckles] You know, my biggest challenge being handicapped… My biggest challenge, man, is crossing that long-ass street… [audience laughs] …with a light with a countdown on. [audience laughing] “Fourteen seconds, what the fuck?!” [audience laughs] “Don’t you have a handicapped two minutes?” The crossing guard comes, shoots a gun, “Wow, go!” “Oh, shit!” “Fourteen, thirteen, twelve, aaah!” [audience laughing, clapping] Ass-old cars revving the engine. [imitates car revving] Now I’m gonna race with an old woman in a walker. [grunts] [audience laughs] “Ten, nine…” [grunts] [audience laughs] Finally get across the street just to get hit by a Citi Bike. What the fuck? [audience laughs, exclaims] Oh, y’all can laugh at me being hit by a Citi Bike. [audience laughs] But the homeless guy, aww… [audience laughs] [laughs] I was in London, man. Anybody from London?\\n[person whoops]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah. Fuck London. [audience laughs loudly] Some of the lights in London count down from seven seconds. Fast as shit. Seven, six, five, four! Had to go back, “Aw, shit.” [audience laughing loudly] [laughs] [chuckles] [cackles] I was in London for two weeks, I only see one side of London. [audience laughs lightly] I never crossed the street, come on, goddamn it! [audience laughs] When I had my first stroke, right, I remember running to my car to call my kid’s mom, Tracy Rome. My best friend, I called her. But I did so much lying and cheating. She didn’t believe shit I was saying. [audience laughs] I’m, like, “I can’t take you to dinner tonight, I’m having a stroke.” “Mm-hmm.” [audience laughs] “If you’re having a so-called stroke, FaceTime me and let me see that shit.” [audience laughs] [chuckles] I had to call looking… [garbled] “Oh, look at me!” [laughs] That’s a true story, man, true. When I got my… [chuckles] …my second stroke, man, I flew from Newark, New Jersey to Arizona to get laid. [audience laughs] First class. [audience laughs] I’m not gonna have a stroke in coach. The fuck I am. [audience laughing loudly, clapping] What kind of animal am I? [chuckles] Like, if you fly first class you know they give you all the drinks you want. You know what I mean? Never stop. No drink minimum, nothing. Bam!\\nBoom!\\n[audience laughs] Slip-slop! [audience laughs] Slip-slop with 15 drinks in. [audience laughs] I’m drunk as shit. [laughs] I mean, time flew past. The pilot makes an announcement. “Twenty minutes left in the flight.” Okay, I’m doing the math. Twenty minutes left in the flight, ten minutes to the girl’s house, total of 30 minutes… What takes 30 minutes to kick in? [audience laughs raucously] [screaming] Answer me! [audience laughs loudly] Viagra, damn it. I popped the Viagra. Men… [chuckles] …never take a Viagra on an airplane. [audience laughs] I was fucked up, man. I was, I fucked up. You know what I mean? I’m, like, “Oh, shit.” My vision was blurry, I’m, like, “Oh, fuck.” I got an Uber. I start passing in and out of consciousness. [audience laughs] But I never panic… [audience laughing] …when I know I gotta make a decision. [audience laughs] “Should I go to the girl’s house and get laid?” [audience laughs] “Should I go to the hospital and live?” [audience laughs loudly] So I’m knocking on the girl’s door. [audience laughs loudly, claps] [audience whooping] She opened the door, I bust in, take my clothes off real fast. I’m in a rush right now. [audience laughing] I have to beat that stroke, you know what I mean? She’s laying on the bed butt naked. I’m butt naked, I’m walking toward her like the living dead.\\n[Keith groans]\\n[audience laughs] [flatly] “Must complete the mission.” My arm goes down. My leg goes down. Only thing still working? Ha! [audience laughs, claps] I should make a commercial out of this shit. “When everything is going down, Viagra stands strong!” [audience whooping, clapping] Now, ladies, don’t ever let me hear you say again in your lives, “We enjoy sex just as much as you men.” Bullshit! How many of you are willing to die for it? [audience laughs] [angrily] Answer me! [audience laughing] [audience laughing loudly] What have you ever sacrificed, lady? What have you ever sacrificed?! Yeah, you! Would you lose your job for it? Of course not! President Bill Clinton… [audience laughs loudly] [audience claps] …sacrificed the most important job in the world… [audience laughs] …for a slice.\\n[audience laughing loudly, clapping]\\n[audience whooping]\\n[audience members whistles]\\n[chuckles] The only thing that got to me, man, is my son. My son cursed at me for the first time. Ever. I’m sitting in my house in a wheelchair. [chuckles] My son comes over. He was crying, man. “Dad.” [imitates sobbing, chuckles] [audience laughs] “We almost lost you, Dad, we almost lost you!” “All for some fucking pussy!” [audience laughs] And I looked up at him from my wheelchair, I’m, like, “Son, are you gay, what the fuck?” [audience laughs loudly, claps] [audience whoops] [chuckles] “Of course that’s what it’s for, what the fuck?” “How do you think you got here, asshole?” I was in the hospital, and a speech pathologist came in. You know what I mean? And the speech pathologist, her job is to see what you can remember, long-term, short-term memory. But she thinks, and thought in her mind, the louder she talks… [audience laughs] …the more I will understand. She’d come into the room, “Hello.” [louder, in singsong] “Hello!” [loudly] “What is your name?” And I would fuck with her, “Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.”\\n[audience laughs loudly, whoops]\\n[chuckles] You should see the look in her face, “Oh, shit, he’s fucked up!” [audience laughs] [laughs] And then she would give me these long-ass word math problems. And she was all excitable. “Are you ready?” [audience laughs] “I’m laying in bed with a stroke, I can’t be more ready, more!” “Here we go! Little Billy went to the store.” [audience laughs] “He had 16 marbles in one pocket, $32 in another pocket, and he left the house with four… fluffy… puppies.” [audience laughs] I’m, like, “Come on!” “On the way to the store, he stopped past his aunt’s house.” “He gave her two of the fluffy puppies.” “He continued to the store.” “Unbeknownst to him… [pretending to cry] …he had a hole in his pocket”. “He lost seven of his marbles.” “What the fuck, am I four years old? Go on!” [audience laughs] “At the store, he spent 10.75.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gravely] Oh, shit. [audience laughs] “He got another pack of 19 marbles.” Fuck! [audience laughs] “All he got was the marbles, the fluffy puppies, and the change.” “What did he bring home?” [audience laughs] I didn’t know this shit before the stroke, what the fuck? [audience laughing, clapping] [audience whooping] [unintelligible] [audience laughs] What are you, a fucking teacher, what the fuck? “Now, see, what he did is…” It’s a joke! [audience laughs loudly] Why do you explain to him? [audience laughs] The what? [audience laughs lightly]\\n[woman, unintelligible]\\nOh, shit. [audience laughs] I just fucked up. All right. Why do you explain it to her? [audience laughs loudly, exclaiming] No, I… My vision is bad from my stroke. [audience laughing raucously] [audience claps] H… Hey, little girl… [audience laughing] I use my st… my stroke for an excuse for everything. [audience laughs] The cops stop me for drinking and driving… [chuckles] “Sir, have you been drinking and driving?” “I had a stro…” [laughs] [audience laughs] “What the fuck, is that alcohol on your breath?” “My medicine!” [audience laughs, claps] [chuckles] “Your medicine smells like Hennessy?” [audience laughs] Ah, goddammit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. [audience laughs lightly] I have, you know… [chuckles] I remember when I… Like, when I went to the hospital, the pandemic was first starting. Do y’all remember when the pandemic first started? I know Black folks, we thought, at first, COVID didn’t infect us. [audience laughs lightly] We didn’t think COVID infected us. We were having block parties…\\n[audience laughs]\\n♪ We don’t get no COVID ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat shit lasted for two hours.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI remember CNN, Jake Tapper came on. [imitating Tapper] “Breaking news!” “More Black people die of COVID than anybody else!” What the fuck?! [audience laughs] Why do we always get the worst of this shit? More Black people die of cancer. More Black people die of diabetes. More Black people die from mountain climbing. “Wait a minute.” [audience laughs] “We don’t mountain climb!” “Yeah, but when you do, you die!” [audience laughs loudly, claps] Like, I was in the hospital for two months. Two solid months, man. Right in the heat of the pandemic. You know, when the pandemic hit, your family couldn’t come to the hospital with you. So I was by myself with me and the nurses. [person whoops] Any nurses here? [some whooping and clapping] [audience laughs loudly, claps] The nurses treated me like shit.\\n[audience laughing loudly]\\nAll those hoes are not heroes! [audience laughs] They left blood samples on my food tray. And I’m now, “Fuck, fuck this. Defund the nurses!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] Except her. [audience laughs, claps, whoops] No, man, I got jumped by a pack of nurses. They fucking jumped me! I wanted a room, ’cause I was falling, like, in the hospital, I fall. And they… start measuring my head. Like, “What the fuck you measure…?” “Well, we’re gonna put a helmet on you.” [audience laughs] “I’m not wearing no damn helmet.” “You’re gonna wear the helmet.” “I’m not wearing a helmet!” I mean, how can I harass the nurses with a fucking helmet on? [audience laughs] You know how dumb that shit looks? “Hey, baby, ahh…” Big, dumb helmet, stickers all around it, like… She, like, “You’re gonna wear the helmet!” “I’m not wearing the helmet!” Matter of fact, take me to the bathroom. And she go and throw me a bedpan. A small-ass bedpan. You’ve seen them. Why don’t you just give me an ashtray, what the fuck? [audience laughs] Matter of fact, gimme the helmet, I’ll shit in the helmet.\\n[audience laughs loudly, claps]\\nAnd so I just threw the bedpan back at her. [groans] But I had a stroke, I didn’t have much strength, so she just caught the bedpan midair. [audience laughs] And she goes and tells me, “I don’t give a shit if you poop yourself.” “You better not get out of that damn bed.” I’m, like, “Oh, shit.” She slammed the door, bam! I’m stuck by myself in my own thoughts. I’m, like, “What the fuck?”\\n“Who she talking to?”\\n[audience laughs] “I’m from South Philly!” [audience laughs] I don’t even know what that meant, but it felt good saying it. [audience laughs] [chuckles] When you are in a brain injury unit, they always keep a camera on you. All the time, they’re watching you, they keep a camera on you. You know what I mean? So I looked right at the camera. [audience laughing] And I put my hospital socks on. You know hospital socks. They come with the suction cups on the bottom. The Air Jordan of socks. [audience laughs] I put them on one by one. [groans] [groans] I wanted to get out the bed. As soon my feet touched the floor the alarm went off. Those bitches came running in with pepper spray and Tasers. [audience laughs loudly] And I’m trying to haul ass like it’s a light, “Oh, shit!” “Twelve… eleven…” [audience laughs] “Ten.” [audience claps, whoops] Some fast-ass Jamaican nurse ran me down. [audience laughs] [chuckles] She was strong as shit. Had me in a full nelson, my feet dangling in the air. I’m, like, “Put me the fuck down! Put me down!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] She put me down. When you have a stroke, you get spasms in your legs, spasms. And my leg just kicked up in the air. I end up kicking this Irish nurse right in the gut. Bam! And she’s, “Oh!” “This motherfucker wanna fight!”\\n[audience laughs loudly]\\n“No!” “No.” “Spasms, I got spasms!” “Fuck your spasms!” And she threw a jab at me, you know what I mean? But I used to box, I just caught that shit, bam! She’s swerving, I slipped it, ah! [audience laughs loudly] [audience claps] “South Philly, bitch!” [audience laughs] But I celebrated too fast. Fucking Puerto Rican nurse was next. She came with a lot of movement, you know what I mean? [audience laughs] Like Zab Judah, she… [grunts] She’d fake with the right, hook with the left. Knocked me the fuck out, man. [audience laughs] Before I went, I heard her say, “South Bronx, motherfucker!” [audience laughs raucously] [audience clapping] Wait a minute… [laughs] Y’all ain’t supposed to applaud for that shit. [audience laughs] I was out cold, man. I woke up, I was in the COVID section. [audience laughs] With a helmet on, what the fuck?!\\n[audience laughs loudly]\\nNo, they did put me in the COVID section, man. No lying, I had no symptoms. No runny nose, no sore throat, no coughs. I think they put me there for bad behavior. [audience laughs] [chuckles] And the COVID section was, like, dark. In a dungeon almost. They ran me through the corridor and all that shit. The ceiling was leaking water. [audience laughs] A guy was playing the organ. [audience laughs loudly] I’m, like, “What the fuck is going on?” And they had a big 70-inch TV with CNN on. And at that time, CNN was showing a death count. And you’d see the clicker. Click, click. I’m, like, “Oh, fuck!” “I see my name, ah, no!” [audience laughing] “I’m here!” They put me… in a room and locked the door, man. And those were the worst days of my life, man. It was horrible, you know what I mean? And none, I mean, none of the NOCs came to see me or anything. Nurses of color. [audience laughs] And there were four Black nurses, I’ll never forget, outside my door, talking. “I’m not going near that nigga, he got COVID.” I’m, like, “What the fuck?” “I can hear y’all!” [audience laughs] Well, I’ll tell you what, thank God, thank God for the white “Make America Great Again” nurses. [audience laughs loudly] They didn’t give a fuck about COVID.\\n[audience laughing loudly]\\n[audience clapping]\\nThey came walking into my room, no masks on, coughing, sneezing. I got nervous, I put my mask on. [audience laughs loudly] They snatched my mask, “Oh, get this fucking mask off!” [audience laughing] Kiss me on my lips, mwaah! That COVID section is a bitch, man. It is. The nurse is telling you, ’cause your family can’t come in, they say… And they show you outside. Or your family can only come and see you if something seriously happened to you, they can see you through a window. I can’t imagine… What the fuck? I’m sitting there, I’m ready to go, I see my family give me… [audience laughs] What the fuck is that? [chuckles] Well, man, I did my time, in the COVID section, honorably. Ten toes down. [audience laughs] All right, seven toes, ’cause I had a stroke, and… All right, fine. You know what I mean? I was an honorable guy snitching on nurses. No, when you’re leaving… the hospital, you know, you’re leaving the hospital, it’s like leaving a penitentiary. They give you all your shit in a plastic bag. [chuckles] And the head nurse was admonishing me. “Don’t come back to this place.” [audience laughs] “You better not come back here.” I’m like, “I’m not coming back.” “I’m gonna do better.” [audience laughs] Well, that asshole Puerto Rican nurse, that motherfucker, going straight to Popeye’s.\\n[audience laughs loudly, clapping]\\nHey, man, thanks so much.\\n[audience clapping, cheering loudly]\\n[audience whooping]\\n[mellow music playing over cheering]\\n[cheering fades]\\n[rhythmic music playing]\\n[music fades]\\nIt’s so easy!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nKeith Robinson, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

I’m gonna tell you a story about something that happened to me. But first I wanna tell you about something that happened to this gorilla.\\nOoh. Okay. So there’s this gorilla named Koko. Has everyone heard of Koko the gorilla?\\nYes. Some for yeses. Koko the gorilla, for those of you that don’t know, is a gorilla that spoke fluent sign language. And in 1999, this is true, Koko met Robin Williams. And a couple of years ago, they told Koko that Robin Williams had passed away. And Koko went, “Koko friend, Koko sad.” Aw!\\nYes, which is sad, but on the plus side, how funny was Robin Williams, that even gorillas are like, “This guy!”\\n“He’s unbelievable.” My comedy barely works if you’re not from the Upper West Side. Robin Williams crossed the species barrier.\\nBrilliant comedian. Also, and obviously, did they have to tell… …the gorilla that Robin Williams had passed away? She wasn’t gonna catch it on CNN or anything like that. I heard about this in, like, September of 2017 and I couldn’t stop imagining somebody walking into a gorilla enclosure, just like, “No. I’ll do it. I’ll do it. Let me.”\\n“Hi, Koko?”\\n“Can you put down the banana?” “We have some bad news.” And they tell Koko and Koko’s like… “Oh, no.”\\n“But Prince is fine, right?” Like, “Get the gun. Koko. Koko, calm down.” And Koko’s like, “Why was the last David Bowie album so sad?”\\nAnd they’re like, “Koko!” And Koko’s like, “What else do you know–” And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like… And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like, “Who is the president right now?” Those are the kind of jokes I write. I write jokes that are so dumb and simple that part of it is like, “Oh, I can’t believe someone took the time to think about that.” “I can’t believe that someone thought that was worth informing an audience of.” I can’t believe– This is true sadly, that in the middle of a pandemic, someone spent 500 dollars on sign language lessons over Zoom… …for a joke about a gorilla. I love a dumb joke. I love a silly joke. It’s my job. It’s my currency. I wrote a joke a while ago that was so dumb, it took a month and a half to realize it was actually too dumb to ever grace a stage.\\nHere it is. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fat horse. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fat horse. Maybe that’s because they get four times as many steps as we do.\\nI… I know, I know. And a month and a half later, I was walking through a Whole Foods and out of nowhere I was like… “Twice as many steps.” They don’t have eight goddamn legs.\\nIt’s twice as many steps. And that’s what this show was gonna be when I started writing it. It was gonna be a show full of benign silliness, like I’ve done my whole comedy life, and then something happened. So, I write radio comedy shows for the BBC. Nobody listens to these things.\\nNo one. People my age don’t even know what a radio comedy show is. Like, I’ll tell people, “I write radio comedy shows.” And they’re like, “What’s a radio comedy show?” And I have to explain that it’s like a podcast, but for the dying. And like, this radio show comes out and there’s this massive wave of indifference, right? No one cares. It’s a radio comedy show. But there are two tweets. Just two. And one tweet’s actually very nice. It’s very complimentary, because the tweet is from my Aunt Nancy in Teaneck, New Jersey.\\nAnd it said– Her fans are everywhere, of course. And the second tweet is from someone I’m not related to. And this guy’s just listened to the show. And this guy’s very upset. And this guy’s very upset, largely by the fact that I… am a Jew. And sometimes people can tell that I’m Jewish because of my name, or my face, or anything about my personality. But this guy’s very upset by the fact that I’m Jewish, and he lets me know, and I make a mistake.\\nI respond to the tweet. I know. And then he writes back and then I write back, and then he writes back, and then other people get involved. And then I go to bed, and I wake up the next morning, and my Twitter feed, it’s just this avalanche of antisemitism. Nothing but anti– And it bothered me. It’s never fun to see that stuff directed at you. And then it stopped bothering me because I started adding these people to a Twitter list. Do you guys know what I mean, generally when I say Twitter lists? A couple of yeses, a couple of blank stares. All right, fine. By the way, you don’t… you don’t need to know what this is. I promise you, it’s an obscure function of a dying platform.\\nLike, you don’t truly need to know. But on Twitter– Yeah… But on Twitter, the way it works is you follow folks. You know that, you follow people, everybody knows. But imagine you’re interested in, like, a common area. Imagine you’re interested in, like, opera or the NBA, but you don’t feel like following a whole bunch of NBA players. What you can do is, you can make a list of NBA players and then follow that list and check it occasionally, right? So I did that, but with anti-Semites. And because of certain issues within the NBA at the moment, there would indeed be some crossover between the two lists. But I made this list of anti-Semites and I like it immediately. I like it for two reasons. Reason number one, let them be on a list for once!\\nOkay? Okay? Even Schindler, not a Jew, we make the list now. And reason number two, these guys got a notification when they were added to the list.\\nAnd the name of this list, and they saw this when they were added, was Jewish National Fund contributors. And I got so many tweets from anti-Semites going, “Take me off your goddamn list.”\\n“I have never contributed to the Jewish National Fund.” And I would always write back, “There’s still time.” “We’re planting a million trees outside of Haifa, be part of the Zionist dream.” And I love my list. I love my list for these two silly reasons, but then I get to love it for a third reason, which is that it’s got all of the worst opinions on it. And that’s one of the reasons you go on social media.\\nRight? You wanna be offended. Right? Same reason you watch cable news. You’re not a moron, you know you’re not getting real news. But you get to be upset. Right? You get to be upset at something someone on the other team did or didn’t do, or something they did or didn’t say. And I have a list. I have a digital terrarium of assholes. And occasionally, with great sanctimony, obviously, I go down the list and be like, “Oh, my God, that’s so racist. Oh, my God, that’s so sexist. Oh, my God, that’s so homophobic. I don’t have any of these opinions. I’m such a good boy.” Anyway, it’s a Tuesday night and I’m doing my favorite thing. When I’m alone, my favorite thing to do is I lie on my couch and I hold my phone like an otter, like an inch from my face. Do you know what I mean? Just a brisk nine, ten hours in a row, just going like this? And I see this tweet from someone on the list. And the tweet says, “Hey!”\\n“Hey.” “If you live in NYC and you have questions about your Whiteness, come to 441, 27th Avenue,” which is in Queens, “Tomorrow night at 9:15.”\\nAnd I saw the tweet. And I thought to myself, I live in NYC. And as an Ashkenazi Jew, I have some questions about my Whiteness. And I’m free tomorrow night at 9:15. And I took a screen grab. I took a picture of the tweet. And I sent it to my best friend in the world, this guy named David Burstein. And I wrote, “David… …do you wanna come with me to this meeting of Nazis in Queens?” And I saw the three dots on the iPhone, that means someone’s texting you back. And then the dots disappeared, then they reappeared, then they disappeared again. And then he called me. And he said, “What’s going on?” And I said, “I’m gonna go to this Nazi bar.” And he said, “Why?” And I said, “I’m gonna listen to everything they have to say. I will learn something. It’ll be fascinating, illuminating.”\\nAnd he’s like, “You’re so brave.” And I was like, “I know, I am so brave.” And the next night around 9:15, I take the subway into Queens, and I get off and I walk to the address of this Nazi bar, and it’s not a bar.\\nIt’s an apartment building. And I thought to myself… “How brave are we?” It was January. It was so– I stood outside this building, freezing, dithering, for like 20 minutes, being like, “Maybe I’m an idiot. Maybe my mouth is writing checks that my butt can’t cash.” And there was one moment where I was like, “Well, obviously I’m in the wrong place.” But I knew I wasn’t. I knew I was in the right place ’cause there was a sign on the front door of this building and the sign just said third floor, but it said it in Comic Sans font, the most radical of all the fonts. And after a while, I sort of rediscover the intestines that I left on the 7 train.\\nAnd I go upstairs… to the third floor of this building. And there’s this long corridor, long, doors on either side of me, overhead lighting, bad. And there’s one open door in this hallway. And when I walk in, the first thing I see in the foyer of this apartment is this older lady. She’s in her seventies, at least, or like eighties, but she moisturizes.\\nAnd like… And she’s got this table in front of her. And on this table is the biggest jigsaw puzzle I have ever seen. A jigsaw puzzle. Here’s how big it is. When I walked in and I saw the puzzle, involuntarily, I just went, “Oh, wow.” And without looking up, she went, “12,000 pieces.” She knew exactly what I was talking about from, “Oh, wow.” And I said, “That’s so much puzzle.” And she went, “This isn’t even all of it.” “This is, like, a quarter of the puzzle. I’ve been working on this part for, like, six months.” And I thought to myself, “You should be further into that puzzle, probably.” Although, maybe White supremacists’ jigsaw puzzles are harder. You know, ’cause, like, all the faces look the same. She’s sitting. I’m standing. We’re making small talk about her tonnage of puzz.\\nAnd like— And she tells me how much like, the puzzles mean to her. And for what it’s worth, I like jigsaw puzzles. And I like people that do them, like, it’s a very, like, thoughtful, fulsome exercise, there aren’t a ton of those left. And it’s even, like, a tidy metaphor for why I’m here, right? Like— Because, as with the world, with a puzzle, you need every piece for a complete picture. You need every piece for a full perspective. If you’re missing even one piece of your puzzle, it is suspect or worthless. But even a metaphorical puzzle, I can do quicker than this lady. Like, she’s making zero progress, and at some point she just went, “You know the last one of these… took, like, three years.” And I said, “Last one?” And she points behind herself, down this hallway. And I follow her finger. And as I go down in, I pass two enormous, framed, framed jigsaw puzzles. Framed. And then to my right, there’s like a threshold. Like a doorway with no door. And when I walk through this threshold, I’m in this living room. And it’s like a… It’s a pretty spacious living room. And there’s, like, a hodgepodge of chairs around, and folks are walking around talking. And of all– Oh, and to my– Sorry. To my left, there’s, like, a big table of, like, pastries and orange juice. And even though I was a little scared, I was like, “Oh, sick! Pastries!” So, I’m eating this Whites’ only muffin. And on the other side of the room… I see this cute girl. And this is how dumb of a moron I am. I saw the girl and I thought to myself with no irony… you never know. You never know, right? You gotta shoot your shot. So, I put down my racist pastry and I went over. And I said, “Hi, I’m Alex.” And she went, “Oh, hi, I’m Chelsea.” And we start chatting and it’s good chat. But a few moments in, Chelsea just went, “Ah! Hey, Alex! The White House! Hmm?” And I thought to myself, “This could go… anywhere.” I actually have a thing for this. I have a thing for this. If anyone ever asks you a question and you know they want a specific answer from you, but you’re not sure what that answer is, there are four words that will save you every single time. Every– Sir, sorry to bother you. Would you mind asking me if I saw the game last night? Did you see the game last night? Oh, can you believe it?\\nWell done. That was very nice. Okay. Very nice. “Can you believe it?”\\nGuys, this works. It’s amazing. “Can you believe it?” It means people’s three favorite things in a conversation. It means I know what you’re talking about, I agree with you, and most importantly, you talk.\\nIt works every single time. By the way, I’m from New England. There is a New England version of this. If you’re ever caught in a stalled conversation with a New Englander, just go, “Fucking Brady, right?”\\nIt works every single time. But this is better? It is evergreen. “Can you believe it?” I have a neighbor in L.A. I never know what he’s talking about. I use this in every conversation with him. He’ll be like, “Oh, recycling!” And I’ll be like, “Can you believe it?” And he’s like, “They should take it out on Thursdays.” And I’ll be like, “Okay.” Or he’ll be like, “Minor League Baseball.” And I’m like, “Can you believe it?” And he’s like, “They should pay the players more.” And I’m like, “Absolutely.” And my favorite one ever, this is like six months ago. He just went, “Hey, Alex, the Kennedy assassination.” And I was like, “Can you believe it?” And he said, “Bobby did it.”\\nAnd I was like, “Oh.” “Well, he got his, didn’t he?” I mean… “Can you believe it?” It is a mirror of a question of an answer, and it works here. Because she just went, “The White House! Hmm?” And I said, “Can you believe it?”\\nAnd she went off on this rant about Jared Kushner.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump’s Jewish son-in-law, and she goes off on how “Kushner and his friends” are ruining the Trump administration and the country. And I so had to stop myself from doing what I desperately wanted to do, which was go, “Oh, I hate Jared Kushner. He sits behind me in synagogue on the Upper East Side.\\nHe’s so goddamn loud.” That’s true, by the way. It’s 1,000 percent true. Kehilath Jeshurun on 85th and Lexington, it’s where he goes. He’s fucking loud.\\nAnd he’s arrogant. That’s the word. He’s so– Like when they call him up to the Torah, he walks up like he wrote it. He’s got a problem, I’m telling you. And– Anyway, she’s off on her rant about the Kush.\\nI’m standing there. I’m nodding, I’m trying to focus more on the face, less on the opinions, you know. And we talk for like 15 minutes. And she does most of the talking, which is a red flag, but not a deal breaker, you know. And after about 15 minutes, I feel someone kind of, like, lurking in my periph.\\nLike I’m being haunted. And when I turn around, there’s this guy standing there. And this guy’s sizing me up with a look on his face that I would honestly most accurately describe as… “This is a Jew!” Like, “I’m pretty sure this is a Jew!” And he said to me, “Hey, can I help you?” As if I was gonna be like… “Yes! Well, I was on my way to synagogue for Yom Kippur! But I got lost and I stumbled in here. Do you know if these muffins is kosher?” But I tried to be neutral and I said, “Hey, man.” And he said, “Can I help you?” And I said, “I’m here for the thing.” And he said, “You’re here for the meeting?” And I thought about saying, “Can you believe it?” But I had just used it, so I said, “Yeah, man, I’m here for the meeting.” And he said, “Chelsea, he’s with you?” And Chelsea just went, “Oh… …we just met, but he seems cool.” And I thought to myself, “Nice.”\\nYou never know, right? And then this guy, like, fumfers for– Like this guy’s not quite sure what to say. But when he recovered, he just said, “Okay. All right. But who is he? Excuse me, who are you? Like, what’s your name?” Here’s the thing.\\nHere’s the thing. Growing up… …I always wanted to be White.\\nYeah, yes. I’m aware there are a few of you looking at me like, “Mission accomplished, buddy.” “Does he not…?” I am White. I’m definitely White. But I grew up in a place where there were different kinds of White people. I grew up in a place where there was a strict hierarchy for Whiteness. I grew up in Boston. I grew up in this really racist part of Boston called Boston.\\nAnd in Boston… And in Boston, there are different kinds of White people, there are different kinds of Whiteness, right? Like, there are Ashkenazi Jews, like me, and we’re in places like Brookline and Newton and an outer suburb way to the south called Sharon, there are the Russians. In Eastie, in East Boston, there are the Greeks. In Dorchester, there are the Italians in the North End. And of course, Irish Catholics, right? ICs practically synonymous with Boston, and they’re scattered all over, but a lot of them very famously concentrate in, anybody know? Southie. Southie, South Boston. Yes. And they’ve had an amazing century. No, truly, an incredible 100 years for the Bostonian Irish Catholics. They’ve gone up a couple of socioeconomic classes as a whole. They’ve had their own president, who was apparently killed by his brother.\\nRight? Like, there’s any reason… But they’ve not ascended to the top of this totem pole. ‘Cause at the top of this pyramid of Bostonian Caucasian, unquestionably? WASPs.\\nWASPs. Exactly. The WASPs. And let me tell you, that is the kind of White you wanna be… …in Boston. You know what I mean? The sort of, like, any country club you want White. Or, like, had a relative on the Mayflower White. Or, like, “I can’t read, but I got into Harvard!” Like, that’s the White you wanna be in Beantown. And growing up, I became so keenly aware of that and I started changing things about myself to appear a little less Jewish. Like, when I was a kid, no one called me Alex. Everyone called me David or David Yosef.\\nMy– My full name isn’t Alex Edelman. My full name, get ready, is David Yosef Shimon Ben Elazar Reuven Alexander Halevi Edelman. That is my full name.\\nI go– Sure. I go by Alex now and my family has noticed the shift. My father’s name is Elazar. That’s the name that he goes by. And he’s like, “You’re not proud of your real name?” And I’m like, “No.” And he’s like, “Why not?” And I’m like, “I don’t know, Elazar. Maybe because it sounds like we’re all in Slytherin.\\nThat’s why.” I have cousins Mikal and Penecost. You can’t even spell their names right in English ’cause there’s no English letter for phlegm. I don’t wanna get into a game of like, “How Jewish are you?” This is how Jewish we are. My brother AJ, or Adam Yitzhak Chaim… …qualified for the last Winter Olympics for Israel. This is not a joke. AJ– I mean, like, it is eventually a joke, but like this… AJ qualified for the last Winter Olympics for Israel. And whenever I tell people that, they always have a few questions. They’re like, “Your brother?” “Yes.”\\n“Your brother?” “Yes.” “Your brother’s an Olympian?” “Yeah.” If you’re wondering, turns out it’s nurture. “Your brother’s an Olympian?” “I know.” “For Israel?” “I know.” “The Winter Olympics?” “I know.” “Does Israel have winters?” “Not really. He had to train in Munich,” in what must be the irony to end all ironies. “What’s AJ’s sport?” “AJ’s sport is called skeleton.” Which is like… Which is like luge but head-first. By the way, my father says on television that I have to inform audiences that AJ is a hero, it’s an accomplishment, and we’re so proud of him.\\nThere. Okay. Skeleton– Oh, are you– No, no, no, no, no. It’s… It’s the dumbest sport in the world, it’s not a real sport, it’s a lunch tray and an icy hill.\\nHere’s… Here’s how dumb this sport is. We went to go see AJ qualify upstate Lake Placid, and this guy from Italy named Cicini, named Jean-Luc Cicini, he crashed at the top of the run, and his little sled went down without him, and the sled on its own finished in fourth place. And I think about that every day, ’cause my brother’s always like, “It’s a skill sport.” And I’m like, “It’s gravity, AJ!” A corpse and some duct tape would medal in this event. You turn on the Olympics and Bob Costas would be like, “Wow, Tom! Look at Simmons keeping his shoulders so still in those corners.” Also, I had no faith in him. No. Like, whenever they interview athlete families, they’re always like, “We knew.” I’m like, “You knew?” “Oh, we knew that Megan was special and she would lead the women’s team to the World–” There was none of that in my house. I made fun of my brother every day. I called him “The Frozen Chosen” for like four years in a row. And then my mom was like, “Stop calling him that.” And this is gonna be too Jewish for a couple of you, but I switched over to “Shul Runnings” and I am so proud. Shul means synagogue in Yiddish. We had T-shirts made. It’s like a whole thing. We’re at… We’re at the Olympics. We’re sitting on this bus from the Olympic village to the venue. And this Israeli reporter was interviewing AJ and he was like, “Adam… …what was it like when you found out you were going to be… an Olympian?” And AJ was like, “Oh, Guri, no one was more surprised than I was.” And out loud on Israeli TV, I just went, “That’s not true.” “It’s not true. I bet my dad 50 dollars that he wouldn’t make the Olympics.”\\nBut he did. He made the Olympics. He’s one of the 30 best skeleton athletes on the planet, out of the 42 skeleton athletes on the planet. And he did it for Israel. And that’s a whole separate kettle of fish, but we are proudly and emphatically Jewish. And it’s a huge part of my background and my upbringing and the filter through which I see the world, but… but… …when I’m standing in this apartment in Queens and this guy says, “What’s your name?” I tell him my name’s Alex, ’cause I’m not gonna give him the backstory.\\nI said, “I’m Alex.” And of course, I said, “How about you, man?” “Like, what’s your name?” And the guy thought about it.\\nHe just went… “My name’s Cortez.” And I said, “I’m sorry, your name is Cortez?” And with a real knife in his voice, the guy just said, “We don’t give real names to people who are here for the first time.” And he looked directly into my face. And I’m trying to look back at him, like not too aggressive, but also not like a coward, and it’s very awkward. There’s like a real moment of tension. But that tension is broken fairly quickly, ’cause this guy just came crossing from the other side of the room and he looked at us, and he just went, “Hey, Matt, we’re starting.” And I was like, “Nice to meet you, Cortez.” And then we start. We start. There was a moment before I walked in where I was like, “All right, if I get scared, I won’t… I won’t try anything fancy, I will leave. I will excuse myself to the bathroom and just go.” But nothing scary is happening yet. People are just pulling up chairs to the middle of the room, and everything’s like a little higgledy-piggledy. But we wind up with like a ragged circle of chairs that doesn’t quite close all the way on the end over here. It’s like a semicircle or like… an anti-semicircle.\\nIt’s… I’m over here. I’m over here. I’m over here. There’s, uh… There are 17 of us, okay? I’m gonna say us. I’m gonna lump myself in logistically. Seventeen of us. Twelve men, five women, including Chelsea, my new love. Chelsea’s, like, two, three seats away from me on this side. This side of the circle, a little bit younger than this side of the circle. But this side of the circle seems to know each other. Much better, a little more engaged, a little more hardcore. This side, of course, has Cortez, my pal. He’s, like, um, five, six seats away from me on this side, jigsaw lady’s sitting next to him, and we start. We start. And for the first 15 or so minutes of this meeting, these guys talked about the royal wedding. Meghan and Harry. It had happened since they last got together, and they were upset about it. And it took me way longer than it should have to realize why they were upset. Meghan Markle’s mixed race. Of course she is. I forgot that. I forgot. You know who didn’t forget?\\nWhite nationalists. They’re very upset. They prefer that he marry a first cousin as per usual. Uh, real quick, I have a connection to Prince Harry, which is that my friend Jack once did cocaine with him in a London nightclub bathroom. All right, that did not get the reaction that I wanted from you. I will sidebar for this. Prince Harry had a cocaine problem. It’s the best thing. We don’t talk about it enough as a culture. It’s in the new book. It’s fantastic. I don’t approve of cocaine, but I love that Prince Harry had a cocaine problem. Because in America, we forget this. But in England, the Queen is on all of the money. So that means at some point, Prince Harry rolled up a picture of his grandmother to do drugs that he bought with other pictures of his grandmother. That will never happen to any of you. None of you can walk into Times Square after this and the drug dealer’s like, “Excuse me, that’ll be 300 dollars.” And you’re like, “Excuse me. Here’s a picture of my grandma at her 50th Jubilee parade.” He’s like, “What?” You’re like, “Here’s a picture of my grandma with Winston Churchill.” And he’s like, “How’d you get this?” And you’re like, “Here’s a picture of my grandma planning the death of my mom.” It only works for him. What are you gonna do about it though, huh? What, are you gonna tell people not to watch the special? Fuck you. What are you gonna do? Just ’cause it’s not in The Crown, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Grow the fuck up. By the way, just so you know, cocaine has no effect on me.\\nNone. Zero. Because I’m part of this generation of over-medicated ADHD children. Do you know what I mean? Like, someone offered me cocaine a couple of years ago, and I tried it, and they were like, “How do you feel?” And I was like, “Like there’s homework to do!” “Do you feel like dancing? We’re going dancing.” And I’m like, “I can’t, I’m putting a bibliography together, aren’t I?” I’m gonna get started on the secondary sources. You fact-check the primary sources. Where are you going? We need 3,000 words on Moby Dick by Thursday. Anyway. They’re upset. And this is a huge group of nodders. Like, if anyone ever agreed with anything, they were like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” And someone’s like, “It’s a disgrace.” And everyone’s like, “It’s a disgrace!”\\n“It’s a disgrace.” And someone else was like, “It represents the sorry state of the West.” And everyone’s like, “The West? What happened to our standards in the West?” And jigsaw lady. Jigsaw– I’m fascinated by this person. Not much for eye contact. Always looking at her shoes, like they owed her money.\\nAlways straight down. But whenever she spoke, you knew who was talking. No one else had a register like this. And at some point, she just went, “Didn’t just happen though, did it? Didn’t just happen is what we’ve come to. This is what we’ve come to. A member of the royal family marrying a–” And then… she uses the N-word. And Chelsea just said… “You know… I’m not crazy about that word actually.” And I thought to myself, “There’s a spectrum of Nazi?” I kept falling in love with Chelsea a little bit. I did, for two reasons.\\nFirst of all, you never know. Second of all– Right? You never know. Second of all, I love romantic comedy films. Right? You wouldn’t watch this? What a great meet-cute for a rom-com, no? We meet at this meeting. She’s played by Anne Hathaway. I like to imagine I’ve booked the role of myself, but if we’re being honest, it’s Jesse Eisenberg or skinny Jonah Hill. And like, we meet at this meeting. And we start dating, and I have to hide the fact that I’m Jewish. And eventually, we start sleeping together, and she’s like, “Why are you circumcised?” And I’m like, “Don’t worry about it.” And, like, things are going really amazing, and I get down on one knee towards the end of the film at the top of the Empire State Building, in the rain, it’s a rom-com. And as I open up my ring box to propose, I lock eyes with my TALMA teacher from fifth grade, and I’m like, “Rabbi Klammer?” And he’s like, “David Yosef Shimon Edelman?” And she’s like… And she runs away. But her best friend, Rebel Wilson, is like, “Girl, you gotta go back to him. He is a good man.” And so we reunite, and we kiss, and the last scene of the movie, we’re married in my parents’ synagogue, right? Like that’s how that would go. You know, on Broadway, I’ve had to explain that to– The stomp to people. So, like, if you guys don’t know, when Jews get married, they wrap a glass up in a napkin and then they crush the glass because the glass represents… happiness. So, you’re just like, bam. Here’s the problem with my rom-com. I date very assertive women. I always have. So, what would really happen is, we’d meet at this meeting, we’d start dating, and then three weeks later… …I would be a Nazi. I’d be standing on my parents’ front lawn in Brookline, Massachusetts, holding a brick, and she’d be like, “Do it.” And I’m like… “Hi, Eema.” “Hi, Mom, this is Chelsea. This is Matt– Sorry, this is Cortez.” There’s so much complaining in this room. That’s the first thing that– There’s so much kvetching in this room. This is around the time they were taking down Confederate statues. Remember that? They’re very upset about that. They talked a lot about how White history is being erased. They’re taking down statues of White people. They’re pulling White people out of textbooks. Someone over here says, “They don’t even teach about White men in public schools anymore.”\\nAnd everyone’s like, “Mm-hmm.” “Mm-hmm.” And White people aren’t just being replaced in the classroom. It’s happening in real life. It’s happening in real life in their own country, in their own country, it’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And what’s enabling this replacement? What’s enabling, as the guy next to me says, “The slow-moving genocide against Whites in America”? It’s this myth. It’s this myth of White privilege. And this myth drives so much of the stuff they hate. It drives diversity hiring initiatives. It drives a popular culture they despise! Despise. And it drives reverse racism, which is when people are racist against White people just because they’re White. And then someone over here says, “It’s the biggest problem in the country today, and no one is brave enough to talk about it.”\\nAnd everyone’s like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” And I can give you two guesses… …at who they blame for this kind of thing. And you might not need your second guess. Because running through this meeting is this thick vein of antisemitism, but I’ve never seen this kind of antisemitism before. It’s almost exhilarating. It’s like thick, Technicolor, weapons-grade, conspiracy-theory level anti– Like, at some point, this guy two seats away from me, he just went, “Jews are sneaky and they’re everywhere!”\\nAnd I was like… “Seems like the wrong time to argue with this guy actually.” “That’s a disgrace.” “That’s a disgrace.” I see myself very much as a Jew. Obviously. But I see myself more than anything else as a Jew. Like when I wake up in the morning, my first thought is like, “Jew waking up.” And not just Jewish religious, observant, thoughtful about what it means in my life. If I was very secular, I’d be a completely different human being. Complete– If I was very secular in a fun, liberal city like New York or San Francisco, I think I’d consider myself bisexual. But because I was raised religious in a place like Boston, I consider myself straight with a couple of secrets. And I remember the first time I was aware of being Jewish. I should have been aware, like, eight days in.\\nBut the first time I was aware… The first time I was aware, I was, like, five years old. I’m at a Chuck E. Cheese at a children’s birthday party in Natick, Massachusetts. And I reached for a slice of pizza that had some sausage on it or pepperoni, something not kosher. And my grandfather was there, and he saw me reaching, and he kicked my hand. Kicked. And he said, “You can’t have that, David. We’re Jewish.” And I said, “What does that mean?” And with a totally straight face, he just went, “It means you’ll never be happy.” And I said, “Be’emet?” which means, “For real?” And he went, “Oh, yeah.” And I said, “Why?” And he said, “It means you’ll never be happy with the way things are. And you’ll always question things. And even when things are pretty good, they won’t seem that good to you.” And I said, “Papa, I don’t wanna be Jewish!” And then my grandfather laughed at me. And he just went… “Sweetie, that’s the most Jewish thing there is.” And it blows my mind when I meet non-Jews, and they say things to me like, “Oh, well, I get it ’cause I used to be a Christian, so.” “Sorry, what?” “Well, I was raised Christian, but a couple years ago, I decided I was nothing, so.”\\nNo– I understand that intellectually. I respect that, of course. But that is not how it works in Judaism. You can’t leave when you feel like it. Judaism is the Hotel California of religions. It is a mailing list, you can never “unsubscribe” from. And I worry that I’m not Jewish enough. I worry that. I– Which is crazy, ’cause to my comedy friends, I’m the most Jewish person they’ve ever met. I’m a beard away from their conception of rabbi. And to my family, I’m Lady Gaga. I called my father once. My father is this lovely, thoughtful professor at Harvard Medical School, religious, wears a yarmulke, a kippah. Every single day of his life. If something goes well, he says, “Baruch Hashem.” “Thank God.” And I called him, I said, “Dad, Abba, I worry that the life that I lead isn’t Jewish enough.” And he said, “Alex, I understand that concern.” And I said, “Do you ever worry about that?” And he said, “Of course. I worry every day that the life that you lead isn’t Jewish enough.” And I am so tough on other Jews. I am relentless with other Jews. It’s my least favorite thing about myself. Like… Like, I was at a friend’s house. I’m meeting my friend’s baby. So many of my friends are having babies or adopting. I’m thinking a lot about adoption, but I’m 34. And I think for adoption, that’s right on the line, age-wise. Right? Like, I think that’s too old. I don’t think anyone is gonna take me at this point.\\nBut like— I’m holding… I’m holding this baby, and the baby starts to cry. Oh, baby’s name is Yasi. My friend’s name is Mati. His wife’s name is Rahel.\\nThese are normal names where I’m from. They are. Those are normal names. And I’m holding the baby, and he starts to cry, which is fine. He’s a baby. But Rahel, who I don’t think’s ever really liked me, just went, “Huh.” “Looks like he’s not a fan of yours, is he?” And I said, “It’s fine. He’s a baby.” And she said, “He actually has a really good sense for men.” And I said, “He doesn’t have a good sense for anything. He doesn’t even know he’s alive yet.” And apparently, never say this to a new mother. I said, “He’s just like a brisket with eyes right now.” And she said, “He’s very intuitive.” And I said, “He’s not. He shits himself.” And the husband, who I’ve known forever, he’s seen enough and he just went, “Whoa! Whoa–” Still calls me David. That’s how long I’ve known this guy. I’ve known this guy forever. And he went, “Whoa! Sorry, David, we’re a little uptight– We are. We’re a little uptight, ’cause people have been judging us for the way that we’re raising the baby.” And I said, “What do you mean?” And he said, “Well, we’ve decide– We’ve decided that we’re not gonna vaccinate until we know a bit more.” And I was like, “Against COVID, you don’t need to. He’s an infant.” He’s like, “Not against COVID, against like mumps and measles and the other stuff.”\\nAnd I was like, “Oh!” “Oh, well, first of all, here’s your disease baby back.” “Second of all, what are you talking about?” And he said, “Well, we’ve read that the vaccines can cause autism.” And I said, “That is not true.” And Rahel went, “What do you know about autism?” And I was like, “First of all, I’ve been tested 11 times.” “You think you get like this without people asking a couple of questions?” I am so neurodivergent. I saw so many child psychiatrists growing up in the Greater Boston area, the last one was free. And I just have, like, one memory. I’m sitting on this brown couch in this doctor’s office, and my mom is outside in the waiting room talking to the doctor. And I just remember hearing her go, “What do you mean, ‘He’s fine?'” And I was like, “Yeah, vaccines don’t cause autism.” “Mati, you know that.” And like, it ends the conversation. He just went, “Well… it’s our opinion, isn’t it? We’re his parents. It’s our opinion.” And I don’t know that I would do this with someone who wasn’t Jewish, but I just went, “Oh, and you guys are embarrassed.” “Right, you’re mortified, ’cause it’s such a low-information opinion.” “‘Cause there’s no basis in science, and it’s so bad for the child, so you probably don’t tell people.” “Something so ill-informed.” And he said, “Excuse me, we’re his parents. You don’t have children. You’ve never had to make this choice. You’re judging us for our opinion?” And I was like, “That’s how we judge people!” “Their opinions and their actions, and the content of their character. It used to be skin color, but someone had a dream.” And he said to me, in Hebrew, in Hebrew, “David, you can’t judge us. Only God, only Hashem can judge.”\\nAnd that worked with me. No, but that calmed me down immediately, ’cause it reminded me how I know this guy. I know this guy ’cause we went to a yeshiva together, which is a Hebrew day school. And in a yeshiva, you study Torah every morning from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., because “yeshiva” is a Hebrew word that means “miserable.” In a yeshiva, when they teach you about God, they teach you that he acts through you. If you are kind, that is God showing kindness. If you’re empathetic, that is Hashem manifesting empathy. In Hebrew, the word is “kli.” It means “vessel.” You are a vessel for God’s action. And so he said to me, “David, you can’t judge us. Only God can judge us. Alex can’t judge us. Only Hashem. Only Hashem can judge.” I calmed myself down, and I remembered that we have this common language and lineage, and that on paper, we’re basically the same person. And I explained to him that it’s possible that God was judging him, but that I was the vessel through which he had chosen to judge him. And we have not been invited back to that house. But it’s worth asking why this guy and his wife, who I have everything in common with, that’s who I go toe-to-toe with in their own living room, I show them so little understanding. In this living room in Queens, where I have so little in common with anyone, I sat there listening to them for an hour. All right. Guys, I sat in a conversation without talking one time… …for an hour, which for me… unprecedented. I couldn’t even nod. Everybody else was like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” I had to nod at things out of context. Like at some point someone was like, “What it means to be a man in the workplace is changing.” And I was like… “That’s absolutely– Yeah, there’s a reckoning going on. I agree with that. It’s way better now. You can’t just, like, throw your interns out the windows. Mm-hmm.” And someone’s like, “Billionaires and corporations control our elections.” And I was like, “I’d like to see meaningful campaign finance reform in the United States.” “Such a progressive value, isn’t it? Yeah, that’s good.” And finally, I get a chance to talk. There’s this guy two seats away from Chelsea, and his name is Witt. And if such a thing can be said, he’s my favorite. You know how some people can be in their early thirties, but they have a vibe of teenager? That’s Witt. He’s a little blithe and slumpy. And, at some point, he’s like, “You know what’s really hard for us now? It’s really hard for us to reach new people on social media.” And I said, “Do you know why that is?” And Chelsea went, “Alex, do you know something about social media?” And I said, “Chelsea, I know a lot about social media.” And I started explaining this thing called the meaningful content algorithm. This is so interesting. All right, it used to be in the early days of social media, when you logged in, you’d see stuff chronologically. Remember that? You’d see things based on when they were posted. But now when you log in, you don’t see that anymore. You see what the algorithm thinks you’ll enjoy most first. That’s because of this thing called the meaningful content algorithm. And it’s Balkanized us into these social media echo chambers, which has made it so hard for new ideas, or in this, like, one specific instance, the oldest ideas in the world to reach new people. And so I start explaining the algorithm, I start explaining social media echo chambers, I start explaining Cambridge Analytica, the company that’s, like, best at this, and everybody’s listening to me. And, at some point, I looked around the circle, and people have got their arms crossed, and they’re nodding at each other, and they’re nodding at me. And I thought to myself all at once, “Oh, I’m positively contributing to this meeting of White nationalists.” I came as an observer. I’m gonna leave as, like, the “youth outreach officer” or something. But there was a moment… where I actually started to feel very badly for these people. I don’t want to be gratuitous, but these are not life’s winners. Hashem has not given with both hands to anyone in this room. They are not the brightest. They are not the wealthiest. They are very badly informed. And most importantly… …these guys are racists in New York City! They’re racists in Queens, the most diverse borough and the most– Guys, it’s Queens. In Queens, you can’t even get 17 Nazis together without a Jew being sat right there in the middle of you. This isn’t Arkan-ssippi. Are you kidding me? We’re two blocks away from Little Ethiopia. Things are going not well for these people. And at some point, I had a thought, which was so, like… I had a thought that was so self-aggrandizing, it took me two years to tell anyone about it. But at some point, I looked around the circle, and I thought to myself, “Wow.” “Look at me empathizing.” “Look at me feeling bad for these people when they’re so horrible, but I’m such a good boy.” “Am I the hero that we need in these difficult and divided times?” And then I thought, “Do I have a duty as a Jew… to hear these people, ’cause there’s actually something to that?” If you raise Jewish children correctly, empathy is the default. Empathy is the true north for every Jewish value. And all of the best Jewish moments of my life are moments where those values showed up in places you would never look for them. Like, once when I was a kid, my family had Christmas. This is totally true. My mom had this friend named Kate. And over the course of a calendar year, Kate lost her last parent and her last sibling. She had nowhere to go for the holiday. My mom said, “Kate, why don’t you come to our house? We’ll do Christmas.” That’s the kind of person my mom is.\\nMy father… did not want that. Mom is a Jew from Cincinnati. She’s a Midwestern Jew.\\nIt’s a slightly gentler existence. My father grew up Jewish in Boston like me, but in a time when it was so hard to be Jewish there, which is between the years 1500 and 1991. And he said, “Cheryl, I will not have Christmas in a Jewish home.” And my mom was like, “Elazar, we’re having Christmas.” And he’s like, “Over my dead body are we having Christmas.” So they compromised and we had Christmas.\\nSo… Yeah, obviously. Obviously AJ and I come downstairs one day. My parents are sitting in the living room. I don’t know if any of you grew up in a home like this. We were never allowed in our living room. Never. The living room is for guests and tragedies. Those are the only times. And every piece of furniture is covered in plastic, in case the real owners of the house show up one day. We come downstairs, no guests. AJ and I look at each other like, “Oh, no. Bubbe died again,” and we sit down… …on the couch. And my mom just said, “Boys… this year… we’re having Christmas.” And AJ and I were so young and insulated. We looked at each other and we looked at my dad and I just went, “Okay. What’s Christmas?” And my father said, “It’s like Hanukkah.” And my mom undermined him immediately and went, “Yeah, but maybe even a little bit more fun.” Hanukkah sucks, by the way. Hanukkah– I appreciate the politically correct world that everybody lives in where we all pretend that all the holidays are equal. They are not equal. Every– Hanukkah’s very much the Diet Coke to Christmas’ black tar heroin. There is no comparison. No– Go into a supermarket come December. Christmas is everywhere. Hanukkah’s one little nub at the end of the shampoo aisle, there’s Passover matzah in there for some reason. And non-Jews are gorgeous ’cause they’re always like, “Well, you’re so lucky. You get eight days of gifts.” I have never met a single Jew who got eight days of decent gifts. Here’s how it works. You get one gift over the course of the– Like if you’re getting a bike, you get, like, a pedal on the first day, handlebars on the second, then the wheel.\\nIt is absolute bullshit. Anyway, we do Christmas and oh, my God, do we do Christmas. We do the lights. We do the Christmas dinner. My… My mom put up stockings above the fireplace with our names on them in Hebrew and we… …we went whole hog. No hog. Kosher, Christmas. But we decked these halls. Deck! And Kate comes into our house. And Kate… …White. Princess Diana haircut, chunky gold earrings, Hermès scarf, shocking blue pantsuit. White. But she walks into our house like a little kid. Just like… And she starts to cry immediately. And my mom said, “Boys, whatever she wants to do, we’re gonna do.” And we did all this deep cuts Christmas stuff. We strung popcorn together on a string. We ate our way through an entire chocolate Advent calendar in, like, 25 minutes. And we watched Christmas movies. Please try to imagine being a young Jew and you’ve never heard of Christmas, and then on the day you find out about it, you watch, like, seven Christmas movies in a row. AJ and I are like, “Oh, so this holiday’s a huge deal, huh?” And the one that sticks out is the Peanuts Christmas special. Snoopy, Charlie Brown, best thing we’ve ever seen. AJ and I are like vibrating an inch from the TV. AJ’s like, “The meaning of Christmas, Snoopy.” And I’m like, “The spirit of Christmas, Charlie Brown.” My dad’s in the corner, like, praying for lightning.\\nLike… And at some point, a character on the screen just went, “Linus, we need to put out cookies for Santa Claus, don’t we?” And AJ and I look at each other. And we look at my dad, and I just went, “Abba… who’s Santa Claus?” And my father says this didn’t happen. And it is the single clearest memory from my childhood. My father rarely cursed in front of us and maybe he thought we couldn’t hear him, but he looked at my mom and he just went, “Cheryl… Jesus fucking Christ.” And my mom said, “Elazar.” And he said, “Come on.” And she went, “Just do it.” This is a direct quote. This is a direct quote from, like… …twenty-five years ago. My father walked up to us and he said… “Santa Claus, boys… he is a fat man.” “But it’s a good fat.”\\n“But it’s a good–” You know, like, Santa’s an avocado or something. “But it’s a good fat. And he comes down non-Jewish chimneys in the middle of the night and he gives gifts to young Christians.” And AJ and I are like… And AJ just said, “And he’s coming here?” My father’s like, “Sure. I guess he’s coming here.” We put out cookies for Santa Claus. We’re very skeptical, obviously. We go upstairs. We go to bed. We come downstairs the next morning. The cookies are gone. Guys, they’re gone. And AJ and I see that and we lose consciousness immediately. We, like, black out, and I know it’s happened, ’cause there’s home video, and on the home video, we’re going crazy. We’re like, “Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He was here! He was here! Eema, he was here! Dad, he was here!” And, at some point, AJ’s standing on the couch and he looked at me and he just went, “Santa came!” And I went, “Baruch Hashem!” And we ran out to the garage. Why? Because this is the one concession my father got from my mom. He’s like, “Cheryl, I will not have a Christmas tree in a Jewish home.” And my mother was like, “I can respect that, Elazar. We’ll put it in the garage.” And there are two photos of this. Weird photos. We’re wearing pajamas ’cause we’re children, but we’re wearing jackets ’cause we’re in a Boston garage in December, and we’re wearing yarmulkes ’cause we’re Jews. But we’re standing in front of a fully-decorated Christmas tree with a teddy bear wearing his own yarmulke on top of it. And we’ve got headphones on. Why? Because this is how long ago it was. We got cassette tape Walkmen. Remember the square dealies? We were thrilled. That was Santa’s gift. Kate had gotten us her own gift. Kate had pulled my parents aside the night before and she was like, “Don’t worry, Cheryl.” “Don’t worry, Elaser.” “I got your boys Jewish gifts.” My father was like, “Oh!” “Okay, um, Kate, when you say Jewish gifts, what do you mean?” And Kate’s like, “I got them gifts from the Torah.” This was Kate’s gift from the Torah. To put in our cassette tape Walkmen, Kate got us, on cassette, the cast recording of Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat… …where the role of Joseph was sung by– Anybody know? Donny Osmond.\\nDonny Osmond, thank you. Donny Osmond. Two photos. Weird photos. Pajamas, jackets, yarmulkes, Christmas, teddy bear, yarmulke, headphones, and on the headphones, an Old Testament story from the Torah adapted into a musical by a British aristocrat where the lead role, sung by a Mormon.\\nIt’s very interfaith. And we go to school that day because yeshiva, Hebrew day school, not canceled for Christmas. And we come home that night and my father gets a phone call. It’s exactly what you think. And the first thing the principal says to him is, “Professor Edelman, your sons have a lying problem.” My father said, “What did they do?” And the principal said, “Well, the teacher tried to explain to the children the very delicate topic of Christmas and Alex raised his hand and just went… ‘We had Christmas.'” And the teacher’s like, “You didn’t have Christmas.” And I was like, “Hmm, pretty sure we had Christmas.” “Lights, stockings, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, meaning of Christmas, spirit of Christmas. Pretty sure we had Christmas.” And the teacher’s like, “You didn’t have Christmas. You had Hanukkah three weeks ago, or four months from now, depending on the Jewish calendar year.”\\nAnyway… …non-Jews believe in this guy called Santa Claus. And in my mind’s eye, I see AJ raising his hand and saying, “We had Santa Claus.” And I’m wrong. The teacher came to the show. I’m wrong about two things. First of all, apparently, AJ didn’t raise his hand. Apparently, AJ lifted two fingers, in the words of the teacher, like he was “ordering his second martini”. And AJ didn’t say, “We had Santa Claus.” Apparently, AJ just went… “We know Santa Claus.” And the teacher’s like, “You don’t know Santa Claus.” And AJ’s like, “Hmm. But we do know Santa Claus.” And the other kids are like, “Who’s Santa Claus?” And AJ’s like, “Oh! He’s amazing. He’s a fat man, but it’s a good kind of fat. And he comes down non-Jewish chimneys in middle of the night, and he gives gifts to young Christians. But… But, last night, because he’s friends with our dad… …he came to our house and he left this Walkman underneath the tree that my parents put in the garage, and he ate all of the cookies.” And the principal said, “Professor Edelman, is this true?” And, apparently, my father just went, “No.”\\n“It… It’s not entirely true.” And Rabbi Falk said, “What do you mean it’s not entirely true?” Then my father said, “Cheryl and I ate the cookies.” “Santa Claus didn’t come to our house.” And my mom says there was a significant pause on the other end of the phone, and then the principal said, “I’m aware Santa Claus didn’t come to your house.” “You had Christmas?” And my father explained. My father explained that this woman was bereft. She had nowhere to go. And he had reservations about it, but he let it happen because he thought it was such a valuable, teachable moment, right, where he could show his children that doing the thing centered in Jewish values, the good deed, may not always appear… conventionally Jewish. Principal says, “Professor Edelman, I understand where you’re coming from but you’re wrong, ’cause what you’ve actually done is you’ve introduced this holiday, that is foreign and corrosive, into your home and you’ve clearly confused your children and perhaps harmed them permanently… …when you’ve given them this holiday. Next year, are you gonna take it away? Will you keep celebrating? What are you gonna do? And more than anything else, this isn’t a good deed. It’s idol worship. It’s the most serious sin a Jew can commit. And you and your wife need to begin atoning for it right now.” And my father, to his credit, said, “Well, clearly, Rabbi, you don’t understand the meaning of Christmas,” and then he hung up the phone. And, look, I love that story. I think it reflects so well on my parents, but there’s such a good question at the center of it, very Jewish one, actually, which is, like, to what do our empathies extend? Is it unconditional? Does it matter who they are? Does it matter how they feel about us? Does it matter why we’re empath– Does it matter why we’re empathizing? ‘Cause, for a while, I was empathizing. In this room, these people feel powerless, they feel voiceless, even if they are 1,000 percent wrong! Those are universal struggles. It’s hard to hate people up close. But once I realized I was empathizing, I was like, “Look at me.” By the way, not just empathizing.\\nConnecting. Once I started talking, I was in the flow of conversation so effortlessly, I thought to myself, “I’m gonna be a grand wizard in like two weeks at this rate.” I’m getting my hood tonight. Like, it’s happening. I keep making eye contact with Chelsea. That’s going amazing. But like— But now my fantasy’s not just Chelsea anymore. Now, it sort of flowered out to the rest of the room. Like, obviously, everybody here’s gonna be a table at the wedding, but like besides that, I’m– No. I’m gonna fix these people. Guys, me. I’m gonna fix them. By the time this meeting starts to wind down, my “good guy” fantasies are like a runaway train. I have spoken more than two-thirds of the people in this room. I am in. They like me. And there’s this guy sitting almost directly across from me, right where the circle gaps, and he’s sort of running the meeting. And, at some point, he was like, “All right, guys. We’re gonna take a break. Anyone who wants to get a pastry, can get a pastry. When we come back, we’ll talk next steps.” And I’m nodding at this point. I’m like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Next steps.” And Cortez, whose eyes have very rarely left my area, just went, “Hold on one– Brian, excuse me. Hold on one second.” And he said, “Alex?” And I said, “Mm-hmm.” And he said, “Where are you from?” And I said… “I’m from Boston.” And he said, “Cool. How long have you lived in New York City?” And I said, “Oh, I’ve been here about nine years.” And he went, “Great. What’s the ethnic origin of your grandparents?” And there was a little voice in the back of my head that just went, “Wow, that third question was so different from the first two questions.” And I was like, “Well, my father’s family is from Poland but my mother’s family… is also from Poland, actually.” And the guy starts peppering me with questions, one after the– He asks me where in New York City I live. He asks me if I live alone. He asks me how much money I make in a year. And, at some point, I got a little offended. And I was just like, “This guy’s got a problem. He’s obsessed with me. Everyone else in this room, they like me. It’s so weird that they’re not stopping him. It’s weird that he can read that.” And he’s like, “Where did you go to college?” And I was like, “I went to New York University.” He said, “What did you study?” And I said, “English Literature.” He said, “Where did you go to high school?” And I said, “I went to a school in Boston called Maimonides.” And he went, “Maimonides?” And I said, “It’s a yeshiva.” Oh! And halfway around the circle, this lady just went, “Oh, boy.” And Witt went, “What’s a yeshiva?” And I said, “It’s like a Hebrew day school.” And Chelsea, looking for any sort of out at this point I assume, just went, “Your parents made you go to a Hebrew day school?” And I said, “Kind of.” And she said, “Why?” And jigsaw lady, of course, not looking at me, of course, just went, “Chelsea!” “So very clearly a Jew.” And because it wasn’t that big a deal, I just went… “I mean, yeah.” “Yeah, I’m… I’m Jewish.” You know… people say that political correctness… is a big part of our culture, but maybe it’s great, because I think political correctness is the reason that after I said I was Jewish, there was a split second where everyone in the circle kind of looked at each other with a real energy of like… “Are we cool with that now?” “Did I miss an email or something?” “I don’t wanna be rude, but isn’t that, like, one of our big things?” And then one person starts to talk, and then another, and then… and then I realized I may have misread how welcome I am. And people are yelling, but no one’s yelling at me. They’re yelling at the guy running the meeting, and I felt a little bad for him. I was like, “They’re not gonna get to the next steps for a while, probably.”\\nAnd Cortez, this guy’s out of his seat like he’s won a basketball game. He’s like, “I told you. I fucking– So obvious. Look at him.” And I look at Chelsea. And as soon as I do, I regret it. She has such an expression on her face. She looks so aggrieved. She has an expression like a shattered and re-glued plate. She looks so upset. And I find it so hard to look at her after that. And this guy running the meeting calms everybody down, no small feat. He’s like, “Okay. Okay. No, I didn’t know.” And he said, “Alex?” And I said, “Mm-hmm.” And he said, “Why are you here?” Which, in retrospect, is an excellent question. And this is my favorite detail from the whole meeting. This is my favorite detail from the whole night. He said, “Why are you here?” And I said, “Oh, I saw this tweet that said if you have questions about your Whiteness, then come–” Before I can finish, Witt, almost brightly, just went, “Oh! That’s my tweet.” “Oh! That’s my tweet,” with a real energy of like, “See? We are reaching some new people on social media.” And even then, I was like, “Yeah, bud, I saw your tweet. And as a White man, I actually–” And I don’t get to finish that sentence. Everyone starts yelling except for– “No. You’re not White. You’re Jewish. You’re Semitic. It’s different.” Someone over here went, “He’s not even a real Jew.” And I was like, “Dad?” And he said, “He’s an impostor from the Khazars.” And I said, “Oh, I– Okay. Well, I don’t know where that is, but I am Jewish and I am White.” And everyone says, “You’re not.” And I thought this would help me. I really did. I went, “Guys. Guys, I know it’s complicated given… …given that Whiteness is largely a social construct… …but I actually benefit an enormous amount from White privilege.” And everyone’s like… “No. No. Are you kidding? Haven’t you been listening? White privilege isn’t real. White privilege is bullshit.” Someone over here just went, “You have Jewish privilege. It’s different.” I was like, “That’s so interesting. I never thought about that before. But actually, I benefit a great deal from my Whiteness.” And Cortez is incensed. He’s out of his seat. He’s like, “It doesn’t exist.” And I said, “Come on, man.” And he went, “Really.” And I said, “I benefit from it.” He went, “When was the last time you got something for being White?” And I said, “Matt, I got a free muffin for it like an hour ago.” I… I don’t wanna spoil the ending of this for you… …but Chelsea and I, we’re not gonna work out. Although it’d be so cool if I could say, “And here she is.” “Come on out, sweetie!” And she’s like, “Ah!” I actually started dating someone. I actually started dating someone a couple months after this. And when I told her about this night, the first thing she said to me, she said, “Just so you know, this is the epitome of White privilege.” And I said, “What do you mean?” And she said, “Nothing says White privilege more than a Jew walking into a meeting of racists and thinking, ‘This’ll probably be fine.'” “Things usually work out pretty good for me, honestly.” “Oh, look. Muffins. Those are for me?” I’ll be out there afterwards, by the way, if anyone wants to ask a question. I answer every question. But obviously, if you’re watching at home and you have a question, I’m obscenely easy to reach on social media. Even if you hated the show, tweet at me. There’s a list I can add you to, you know? And the two questions I get the most are, one, “Were you scared?” Not really. Here’s the thing. Nazis, hmm, far less intimidating than the way that my grandfather described them. Also, they’re not Nazis. But– I hate to clarify a joke, but being a Nazi is actually such a specific thing from an extremely specific moment in history. These guys wish they were Nazis. Like, you ever see kids in the park, and they’re hitting each other with tinfoil swords? These guys are Nazis the way that those guys are the Knights of the Round Table. These are Nerf Nazis, you know? And the second question I get asked every single day is, “Why’d you go?” “Did you really go?” “My wife and I can’t believe you.” “Why’d you go?” Thought I could make it work. It’s my job. I make it work. I get on stage every night, and I am pandering and solicitous. And I hope that it’s enough to make people enjoy the show or tell a friend. Please tell a friend. And it’s gross. And there’s a huge part of me that genuinely walked into this room thinking like they’re just anti-Semites ’cause they haven’t met Alex yet. Haven’t met David Yosef Shimon Ben Elazar Reuven. This… not that different from the meeting. Not for me. I’m only telling you stuff I think you’d enjoy. Right, like, if you really knew me, you might not like me, right? There’d be a political opinion you couldn’t stand, or I’d be too something. I’d be too pretentious, or ambitious, or lazy, or too Jewish, or not Jewish enough. There’d be something. You know who I think about constantly? Robin Williams. A gift for connection no one else could– A gorilla! A gorilla was like, “Oh, my God, the talent is undeniable.”\\nA gorilla! If Robin Williams can make it work with a gorilla, I should be okay with 16 White people in Queens. Trying to acknowledge their humanity with this analogy, but I am aware that in this analogy, these guys are gorillas and I’m one of the greatest comics who’s ever lived. But if you think about it, who gets dehumanized? Right? ‘Cause for a second, I’m in. I’m White. Finally. Right? Childhood dream achieved. And then they find out that I’m Jewish… and the walls go up. But it doesn’t reflect amazing on me, ’cause I wanted them to like me. I was performing. I am always perform– I got kicked out of this meeting, and it bothers me… …on a craft level… …’cause that’s what happens. This guy calms everybody down and he’s like, “Okay. Okay. We’re gonna take that break and anyone who needs to leave can leave.” And even though I’m not amazing with social cues, I was like, “I bet he means me.” And this is the kind of dumb joke the whole show could have been. Everybody else… …gets up and they all move… to the far right corner of the room. And I’m getting my stuff. I look sad now. I look like I’ve lost Wimbledon or something.\\nI’m like, “Oh, God.” “Can’t believe they would do this to the good boy.” And Chelsea… Chelsea. Chelsea crosses this vast expanse of floor to me. And I felt so bad for her in that– I remember thinking, “Man, horrible time and place for you to discover that this is your type.” And she gets to me. She said… “You’re Jewish?” And I said… “Can you believe it?” And for the first time, it doesn’t work. And she went, “So you’re fully Semitic or partial? What’s going on.” And I said, “Both my parents are Jewish.” And she said, “That’s so interesting.” She’s very calm, actually. “That’s so interesting. You know why? Because this is a private residence.” And I said, “Well, I was invited.” And she said, “You were… You weren’t invited. You’re committing a crime right now. You’re trespassing. You can’t be here. This is just for us. Go!” So… So the next morning, call David Burstein… tell him what he missed. And he’s quiet all the way through. He just lets me talk. I talk for like 40 minutes. But when I got to this part of the story, he interrupted me. And pardon the language, but he was like, “And you looked at her and you said, ‘Fuck you, lady.’ And then you looked at everybody else in the room and you’re like, ‘Fuck every single one of you racist, bigoted, anti-Semitic assholes.'” And I was like… “Yeah.” “Of course I put a finger in her face and I’m like, ‘Screw you. And screw– Screw all your little Nazi budd–‘” But that’s not what happened. What really happened is, I got scared by the trespassing thing. And I quailed immediately, and I just went… “Okay.” And on the way out, this is so much worse, I looked at everybody else, and I just went, “Sorry, you guys!” And I left. I left. You know, I had a conversation with someone the day before this run on Broadway started and… and he said to me, “Would you go back?” “A thousand percent.” And he said, “Really?” I said, “Yeah. What, I’m supposed to lock myself in a room with people who agree with me?” “That’s how you wind up like this.” But I get his point, because whenever anyone is like, “Oh, the way to reach these people on the far right or the far left is to extend this hand of brotherhood and connection, and let them know that in the marketplace of ideas, they are welcome–” Like that’s a lovely notion. That’s how I feel. That’s a Jewish value. But some of them want us gone. And when I say us, I mean, us. Like even if you guys aren’t Jewish or a person of color, the fact that you bought a ticket to this show… …I feel bad for you guys. You guys are screwed. See you on the trains. They hate you so much. I’m glad I went. I really took something away with me. Not like a lesson or anything like that. I really took something away with me and it’s very small, but I think it’s significant. And I think it’s significant because it’s one piece from a 12,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\\n♪ (“SECTION 14 ” BY THE POLYPHONIC SPREE PLAYING) ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n♪ And I know there’s a lot Outside the window ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot For you and me ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It takes the sun To make the sidewalk ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It takes the moon To burn my feet ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It means a lot To take some time ♪\\n♪ I know it’s right You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n♪ You gotta be good You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot to show ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You’ve got the time to grow ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot to show ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You’ve got the time to grow ♪\\n♪ You got 2,000 places ♪\\n♪ Whoo! ♪\\n♪ And time will show the way ♪\\n♪ And love will shine today ♪\\n♪ And time will go away ♪\\n♪ So love can grow ♪\\n♪ (SONG CONCLUDES) ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAlex Edelman, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 thought on “Alex Edelman: Just for Us (2024) | Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCat Nygaard 10/05/2024 at 01:41  \\n\\n\\nLoved, Loved, Loved this show!!

Stripping away the primal elements typically associated with the act, Novak invites the audience into a cerebral discussion on the subject, humorously dissecting its semantics, cultural perceptions, and the juxtaposition of physical desire with intellectual analysis. Her performance, characterized by self-deprecation, sharp wit, and a refusal to conform to conventional comedic tactics, offers a fresh perspective on gender dynamics, sexual expectations, and the often-comical reality of embodying a “thinking, feeling, desiring body” in a society filled with contradictions. Through her insightful and comedic lens, Novak navigates the complexities of sexual identity and expression, making “Get on Your Knees” a thought-provoking reflection on the absurdity of human sexuality.\\n* * *\\n[“Like a Prayer” by Madonna playing]\\n[horn honking]\\n♪ Life is a mystery ♪\\n♪ Everyone must stand alone ♪\\n♪ I hear you call my name ♪\\n♪ And it feels like ♪\\n♪ Home ♪\\n[crowd cheers]\\n♪ When you call my name ♪\\n♪ It’s like a little prayer ♪\\n♪ I’m down on my knees ♪\\n♪ I wanna take you there ♪\\n♪ In the midnight hour ♪\\n♪ I can feel your power ♪\\n♪ Just like a prayer ♪\\n♪ You know I’ll take you there ♪\\nThank you. Despite… Despite your warm welcome, that journey was hell. [audience laughing] The journey from backstage to a microphone always is. It’s fraught. And it’s ’cause for me what it reminds me of, frankly, uh, is the journey, you know… [audience chuckling] …from someone’s face, down their torso… [audience laughing] …to their pelvis, to give them a blow job. ‘Cause the whole way there, both scenarios, everyone knows what you’re headed to do, but you’re not yet doing the thing, so there’s just this question hanging in the air the whole way of, “Can she do it?” I mean, “Will she do the thing we’re all here for well or badly?” And oh God, the uncertainty, the [exhales]… the tenuousness. I mean… [exhaling] Can you feel it? [audience laughing] I am gonna talk about the blow job quite a bit tonight. “To the point of tedium,” said one early critic.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI think I do it in a way that allows us all to maintain our dignity. Uh, if you’re here with a parent or a sibling, it will be okay. I’m very concerned with dignity. I’m someone that, for example, prefers to call “doggy style” “the Hound’s Way.” [audience laughing] I think the position deserves a term with some gravitas. I think it’s one of our more noble positions. I feel like any of these positions where you’re staring into the eyes of your lover, you know, as if to become one, there’s something immature there, I’m not impressed. [audience laughing] To me, the Hound’s Way, it represents a more mature kind of love, where two lovers can look towards the future together. [audience laughing] You know, it’s not… it’s not sad. It’s not sad that I’m not looking at him, that I’m not making eye contact with him. Because it’s more like… it’s more like we’re these two pioneers headed west. And I gotta keep my eye on that horizon ’cause these are… these are tough times.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckling] But I’m a strong woman. I know hubbin’s gotten from behind. I feel him bringing it up the caboose. I just gotta put my face into the wind and keep on keeping on through this good night ’cause our young nation depends on it. That sort of thing. [audience laughing] I do have a sort of poetic sensibility I like to warn people about at the top of the show because I know it can be trying at times. I can’t help myself. Yeah, I used to write poetry in college. Like many, I gave it up. I grew tired. I grew tired of being in a constant state of enchantment. [audience laughing] You know, just so many hours spent curled in windowsills, just the muscles cramping, the eyes drying out from all that wonderment, just… Every night seeing the moon as if for the first goddamn time. I just wanted to grow accustomed to the moon, you know? I wanted to take moonlight for granted, like other girls.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI hope you’ve taken your opportunity by now just to, you know, take in my physical form. Uh… That is your right, you know. [chuckles] I take the stage, you show up, you get to look, and fair enough. Fair enough. But it is a nightmare, it is a nightmare for an intellectual like myself. [audience laughing] Really to be incarnate at all, frankly. I mean, as a woman of ideas on some level, everything, everything from the chin down feels beneath me. I don’t know what else to say. “Limbs and torso, there she goes.” All a bit common. You know? The female form, this female form of mine, this sort of sack of sex potatoes, you know, this tits and ass that can’t leave home without, oh, an explanation for. “Why would you bring those out if you didn’t bring enough for the class?” [audience laughing] I can’t leave them at home. No taters for sale tonight. You know? No. No, I like to keep it moving on stage ’cause I know, I know how you people operate. Okay, okay, I stand still for too long, you see something you like, you take a mental snapshot. Who knows what you’ll do with it later? I… I much prefer… I prefer to keep things moving, keep ’em blurry. Thank you very much. Try to take a mental snapshot and it’s nothing but a gray blur. Simple self-preservation. No, I look forward to it. I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, through death, of course, as a ghost.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSpecifically. I look forward to being a ghost, think of myself as a future ghost, the body as training wheels I can’t wait to cast off and fly free. You know? Not too free, of course. In order to become a ghost, you gotta get stuck here, and I’ll do what it takes. You know? You know, manufacture some unfinished business, do what’s necessary. My meditation practice these days, it’s getting too strong, you know? It’s getting too consistent where spiritually I’m kind of in a place where I die I sort of instantly transcend, instantly dissolve into the one. And that’s not what I want. I want to linger. Do you see, I wanna linger as me. I want to haunt a house, and I know perhaps that’s a quaint dream, you know, unoriginal, but it’s mine, nonetheless. I mean, imagine. To night after night, to night after night just watch television behind someone watching television. [audience laughing] Just giving yourself over to their programming choices. I mean, that… that would be a meditation in its own right, the surrender required there, you know. I just, uh… I wanna be a ghost, but if I make it as a ghost, I wanna be a strong ghost, a robust ghost, you know. No blurring away at the edges for me. I wanna have fully articulating fingertips. I want to be 75% opacity at minimum. [audience laughing] I’d say 85 max. I want you to know I’m a ghost.\\nOtherwise, what’s the point?\\n[audience laughing] Primarily you just wanna make sure you don’t end up as one of these orb figures, uh, the orb characters, they’re kinda the embarrassment of the ghost community, depending on who you talk to. [chuckles] I don’t know if you guys watch quite as much nonfiction, paranormal programming inside the home as I do. I watch quite a bit. I’m a lifelong learner. [audience laughing] But if you don’t know… if you don’t know the orbs, those are those, uh, small, transparent circles of light that occasionally appear in a photograph and someone’ll say, “Oh, great-grandmother did come to the wedding.” It’s nice. It’s really nice stuff. [audience chuckling] But people are so rude about orbs. I mean, if you try to talk about an orb with anything resembling seriousness, they come for you. They simply come for you, you know? And it’s just so rude. I mean, because imagine if you were the great-grandmother and you did it, you know? You managed to gather your strength in the afterlife and appear for your family as anything at all. I mean, a little circle, that’s pretty good. I mean, have any of you ever made yourselves appear as anything at all using your consciousness alone?\\nI certainly haven’t.\\n[audience laughing] One of the basic shapes. And then to be dismissed, just summarily dismissed by some surely unrigorous skeptic of a great-grandson. [laughs] I will not have that happen to me. No, everyone will know who’s present. It’ll be, “Hi, Johnny, it’s me.” You know? But that’s not the point. That’s not the point. Well, you know, if you insist on such a thing and you would, wouldn’t you? No, the point is I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, uh, its needs, its wants, you know, all hideousities to me, uh… I am what many would historically call a heterosexual woman, and no, I’m not proud. [audience laughing] It’s a patent humiliation in this day and age. I know what you’re thinking. Does she even read? [audience laughing] And I do, I do, and yet, you know, how can I when I’m just a… a girl with a ponytail just lusting after the common shaft? [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t believe it happened to me. I mean, just that simple cylinder, that… that familiar tube, that object of seemingly no nuance. The word I’m avoiding saying, of course, is “penis” and now I’ve said it.\\nAnd do I feel better? No, I don’t.\\n[audience laughing] I don’t love the word, few do, you know. A big part of me would probably rather say the word “cock” for you people. I think a lot of you’d rather hear it. The boyfriends sure did, you know? [audience laughing] Cock is a good word, it has a kind of dignity to it. You know, you gotta wind it up and kick it from the back of your mouth. “Co” but then “ck.” It lands. A “ck, ck.” It lands on the same damn consonant it started on, you know? Penis. Penis just sort of slips out the side of the mouth.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Penis.” “I’m sorry. Did you say something?” “Well, I’m not sure anymore.” “I thought a word and I felt something happen.” You know? People say, people say, “Well sure, I wouldn’t use the word penis sexually, it’s too clinical.” I don’t hear the voice of the clinician in that word. I don’t think penis is our most medical-sounding word. I mean [chuckling]… I think the problem for people… I think the problem for people with the word penis lies in its sort of tender emotionality. I don’t think the word penis is a problem for people ’cause it sounds accurate to what it is. Penis. Penis. [chuckles] It sounds like a soft heartbeat. Penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis. And I think that’s the problem. I think… I think… I think the problem lies in the syllables themselves too. I don’t think this is one of these Rose-by-any-other-name scenarios. No, “Pe-” is clearly a problem. Pe… Peener… Pee-pee. You know, it’s been mocked for ages and rightfully so. You know? But to me, the true… the true tender syllable of devastation, oh, it’s the “nis.” It’s the “nis.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI mean, can you believe that’s been there the whole time? “Nis.” “Nis.” And that’s why no one speaks of that syllable. That’s why… that’s why no one says, you know, “Show me that nis.” [audience laughing] Wait till you see this nis? Nis-nis? They won’t even make a joke. No, it’s too tender. It cannot be spoken. No, “cock” clearly, clearly… “cock…” Clearly “cock” is the sexy word. You know? But there’s an issue. There’s a problem with the word “cock” for me. In a way, it becomes unsexy. And the problem is that when I call the penis a cock, I’m not actually calling it like I see it. [audience laughing] I’m kind of telling it what I think it wants to hear. [audience laughing] I’m worrying about the feelings of the penis. I’m coddling the little ego of the penis. I’m humoring the penis. Like, when I call the penis a cock, I don’t throw it away. It’s not cock, it’s cock. “Who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” [audience laughing] When I call a penis a cock, I’m humoring it. Like I might humor my little nephew, for example, or a friend’s son, you know? [laughs] You know, one of these guys, these over and down guys. These little… the person I love and the little guy below them. Like… when I call the penis a cock, I treat it like I treat my little nephew. He’ll come running into the kitchen where the adults are talking wearing a little monster mask or something, and we… we see him and it’s sort of like, “Oh, sorry, sorry… Ah!” and then right back to talking. [audience laughing] ‘Cause he didn’t scare us.\\nHe was unsuccessful in his little ruse.\\n[audience laughing] And you hear his feet… you know, he’s coming around again. You give him it even faster the second time. “Ah!” Right back to it. No showmanship… [laughs] …and yet he’s been rewarded. Now… Do you love your nephew? Of course. But do you respect him? [audience laughing] I don’t think you do. No, no, true respect… true respect for the nephew isn’t “Ah!” Right? No, true respect for the nephew is “What? No, you didn’t scare me, but I believe you can.” “So… so try again.” And to me, it’s the same with the penis. True respect for the penis, you know, it’s not, “Oh, who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” Right? True respect for the penis is, “Penis.”\\n[moaning]\\n[audience laughing] If the penis is enough, then the word “penis” should suffice, you know? If the penis has a chance at being sexy, then the word penis should have a chance at being sexy. And in theory… in theory, it’s enough, you know? You know? In theory, it suffices. I mean, arguably, I’m a fan in the sense that I show up for it time and again with a regularity you can count on. I’m a sort of church mouse to the wafer crumb on Monday morning. There’s me. Sniffing about, hoping for a taste of the divine. So if the penis isn’t the fucking cock, that I feel like I have to act like it is in its presence, but I’m still showing up for it. I’m still a fan. Then what am I showing up for? What is the penis to me? What is its nature?\\n[exhales]\\n[audience chuckling] Well, it’s tender.\\nIt’s responsive. You know, it’s like…\\n[audience laughing] It springs up under certain conditions. That’s why I think it has the soul of an artist, you know. [audience laughing] It sees something that intrigues it and it sort of… [audience laughing] It fills with inspiration. And it is a filling to me. It is a filling to me much more than it is a… [clicking] …erection. I think erection’s a little architectural for what’s happening there. I don’t think anyone should go in that building, I don’t think it’s safe. It’s not up to code. [audience laughing] And unlike a building, it doesn’t… it doesn’t topple, it withers. It dies on the vine. [audience laughing] The penis… the penis, it blooms and it withers and it blooms again. This kind of eternal flower stretching towards that which nurtures it, you know, as if warmed by the sun. I mean, it’s moving. It’s a romantic figure, a boldly romantic figure. I mean, it gathers its strength, you know, to just stretch away from the rest of the body. Just goes for it in this plea, you know. It just… [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] “Love me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience applauding]\\n“Touch me, please.” “Touch me.” “Touching you, touching me.” “Quick, I only have a minute.” [audience laughing] Meanwhile, they try to tell you the vulva is the flower, you know. The vulva is the rose, the petals of the rose. You know, the vulva. I appreciate those comparisons, you know. They’re trying to say that the vulva is beautiful, and I agree, you know. But if someone gave me a bouquet of roses and one of them looked like my vulva, [audience laughing] I’d say, “I think someone stepped on one of the roses.” [audience laughing] It slipped from the bouquet, someone stepped on it. Then they tried to get rid of the evidence by kicking it into a crack in the wall. And it just won’t fully disappear inside there, will it? No. And why are the petals so thick? [audience laughing] No, the vulva… the vulva is beautiful, but it requires the kind of tilted gaze of a more poetic eye. Shall I step in? I mean, I’ll give it a shot. To me, the vulva… my vulva, perhaps, my vulva is beautiful in the way that a tattered flag is beautiful. [audience laughing] Its frayed edges telling a tale of how ideals met actualities. [audience laughing] To me, a vulva may be beautiful in the way a burger is beautiful. A burger with all its particular fixings, you know, wrapped up in crinkly, greasy, foiled paper, and then they cut… I love when they wrap it up and then they cut it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd then they go… [swishes] Then you see the layers, these different textures and they’re pressed together. And yeah, there’s a threat of a spill. Yeah, there’s a risk of a sudden disassembly. But it holds. It holds. The vulva is the burger that holds. [audience laughing and applauding] The penis is the flower. The penis is… I think the penis is a feminine icon, if I may be so bold. [audience laughing] At very least, it’s the most feminine thing on my boyfriend’s body. Like, if my boyfriend got out of the shower and said, “Quick, find the little woman on this man.” [audience laughing] It’d be an odd game, but I’d instantly have an answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not the shoulder.\\n[audience laughing] I’d go, “I see her. I see her. She’s right there. Susan.” The name Susan would come to me instantly. His penis is a Susan, but looking back… looking back, they were all Susans to me. They were Susans, they were Geraldines, they were Vanessas. Now, am I saying the penis is a little woman? Well, if you’re a certain kind of guy who really doesn’t like that idea, then yeah, that’s exactly what the fuck I’m saying. [audience laughing] But no, it’s more like… it’s more like the rude stereotypes of women. Those were good descriptions of the penis the whole time. Describe women unfairly, you’re probably describing the penis perfectly, you know. “Oh, they’re so sensitive. They’re always reacting to things.” “They’re needy, they nag you, they poke you in the night.” “Hello. Are you awake?” “I’m awake. I guess we’re both awake now.” [audience laughing] The penis is the sensitive. The penis is the nag. The penis is the drama queen. I mean, the ultimate drama queen. Just one minute, life of the party, and then the very next just flopped over and sulking on the fainting couch… [audience laughing] …that is the inner thigh, just waiting for someone to notice that frankly she’s upset. [audience laughing] Can’t be mad at her, she didn’t make a scene, she just stepped aside. Just left the… I’m not making a face. This is my face. [audience laughing]\\nThis is the face you married.\\n[audience laughing] The penis orgasm has kind of a hysterical quality to it… [audience laughing] …in the old sense. A proper turn-of-the-century Vienna Freud’s couch. A proper neurotic hysteric. The orgasm, a kind of sudden revelation, a hideous blurt, as a… “I killed father,” you know. [audience laughing] A little… a little bit of Abigail in the courthouse in The Crucible. And I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil! And now everyone… everyone’s gotta deal with it. A hint… a hint of my mother at a family gathering. Something comes to mind she thinks to say, realizes she shouldn’t. And then there’s a pushing it down, but the only relief for her is for her to just get it out. I see her coming my way, just… [muttering] “Are you sad you don’t have kids?” And it’s on me. [audience laughing] And she feels better, and fair enough. Fair enough. I get her a journal every year for Christmas, but I’m the journal. I’m the journal, and that’s okay. [audience laughing] That’s okay. But no, I feel like my orgasm… my orgasm doesn’t put it on you in that same way. I feel like my orgasm has more of a selfless, heroic, frankly militaristic quality to it. [audience laughing] I feel like my orgasm’s like, “You guys, run, run!” Like, “I’ll throw myself on the grenade and absorb the shock with my body.” [audience laughing] And then at its most, you know, explosive moments of pleasure, the vaginal vulva complex, it doesn’t explode. You know, it holds.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt holds. It embodies the masculine, Stoic, ideal. It just pulses. Doing isometric work, contained and strong. A Viking against a tree after the battle is over. Just pulsing to the rhythm of the battle drums fading away. No, the penis… the penis is clearly the more physically vulnerable of the crotchal items we come across. That’s why I’ve never understood why it doesn’t fully retract into the body… [audience laughing] …after it’s done doing any of the things it does. I always feel like, “Wait. Why can I still see you?” “You’re weak. You need to go home.” “It’s not safe for you out here in that form. You need to retreat.” “Please retreat. Retreat. Retreat.” Sometimes I like to think of it as a puppet at a puppet show. It comes out and does its bit, but after this puppet’s bit is over it doesn’t disappear behind the puppet theater. This puppet just dies over the front of the stage and hangs there lifeless and scaring the children while the show continues, and you’re going, “I feel like we’re not supposed to be able to see that character anymore.” And you’re just hoping someone will just reel it back in or the other puppets will incorporate its death into the narrative.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe penis’s vulnerability is something I’ve been aware of for some time. Really since, I don’t know, age 11 when I started reading these magazines with these articles, headlines on the cover, “How to please your man.” They broke the story every month and I’d flip to the article to see if there was anything new. And it always kind of came down to a list of instructions about how not to injure the tender penis. You know? I remember specifically they said, “Careful near the tip.” “It’s extremely sensitive.” “You… you can’t imagine a part of the body as sensitive as the tip of a penis.” It’s like, “Oh God.” It must be very sensitive then, and that’s the first thing I’m gonna run into on the penis, like in my approach. I have to land gingerly ’cause that’s the most sensitive part? Shouldn’t you bury that treasure somewhere deeper in the castle?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI go, “All right. Once I’m past the gauntlet of the sensitive tip, surely now I can relax.” “I mean, I’m on the shaft, right?” The shaft sounds strong, but no, they had a warning there. They said the underside of the shaft, the skin is thin and delicate. Shall I dab eye cream on it with my weakest finger? [audience laughing] Dab and tap. We’ll need dab and tap. And then the balls, the storied balls. Endless mythology of the balls, the way things can go wrong for them and it’ll be your fault. The blue balls legend, of course. Cross-culturally it can vary, but the essence is always the same, you know. If you’re the cause… if you’re the cause of an erection, well… well, you better answer for that erection you caused. ‘Cause clock’s ticking and pretty soon those balls down there, well, they could turn blue and I’m just… it’s never clear what happens after that.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAll that’s clear is that now you’re the witch. You’re the witch. [audience laughing] You’re the witch that turns little balls blue. It’s just never been… it’s never been a sexually-inspiring threat to me. The blue balls threat. You know that kinda, “Oh, somebody might want to do something soon like jerk me off or something, ’cause otherwise it’s really gonna hurt down there. Ooh.” It just turns you into this baby and me into your mama sexually where I have to look out for your potential medical emergency ’cause you know, it takes a village. [audience laughing] No, I… I think it’s the helplessness of blue balls that repulses me. That kinda… you know… the refusal to relieve oneself. If I have a very full bladder, I don’t stand around complaining, “Why isn’t anyone bonking me on the lower abdomen to get the urine out.” Right? I would excuse myself to relieve myself. But blue balls has this kind of… kind of… kind of… “No!” Right? “I don’t do it. No.” “No!” This kind of overtired… “No, I don’t do it… No, only Mama.” [audience laughing] “Only Mama burp my dick.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s a burping of the dick. [chuckles] If blue balls are real, then to relieve them is to burp them. And look, I occasionally overreach with my metaphors, you know, for the love of the game.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNot that one, that one’s perfect. [audience laughing] The teeth-shaming started young. The messages of “Oh, if you have your full set of teeth, don’t you go in a room where a penis is.”\\n“It’s not safe for that penis.”\\n[audience laughing] “Why would you put that penis at risk, you toothy monster?” What’s the idea, what’s the plan? Are you gonna try to give someone a toothy blow job? Is that the idea? The Toothy Blow Job, another tale from Grimms’, I guess. [audience laughing] And somehow kind of a big concept at my high school. The first time I understood this in a practical way that my teeth were a potential danger to the penis, I was 12. I was at my best friend’s house after school. So it was me, it was my best friend, you know, 12, her older sister, 16, and the older sister’s best friend, 16. So the relationship there, you know, is… is over, up, and over and I always feel like Over, Up, and Over is someone you can get real information from. [audience chuckling] I know everything Over knows. Everything Over knows came from Up. Over, Up, and Over? That’s a diagonal… that’s a diagonal wisdom. You go, “Thank God I’m here on this day. It didn’t have to go this way.” But I feel like she knew her role was to teach ’cause she said to us, kinda out of nowhere, “All right, so I guess I’ll show you girls now how to give a blow job because well, you’ll need to know eventually and ’cause I’m the blow job queen.” She just said it. [audience laughing] And she took a cucumber out of the fridge and she wrapped it in cellophane out of respect for dinner, which I appreciated… [audience laughing] …and she began to demonstrate on the cucumber. I don’t know who can learn from a demonstration in this life, I mean, any context, you know, they just do nothing for me. Watching the art teacher paint. It’s just, “Indeed, I… I see why you’re the teacher.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You’re very good.” “Shall we proceed to our canvases now so the humiliations can begin.” You know? She’s demonstrating on the cucumber and I’m more stuck on what she said. The “blow job queen” thing. Maybe even more the way she said it, ’cause she just said it, you know, she just let the words ring out in the air. She didn’t make a face to let us know that she knew that she was being a little funny or grandiose. No, she just said it and she launched into her demonstration with authority and I had questions, none of which I asked, to be clear. No, no, I mean the first one being, “According to whom?” But I’m not going to ask that, okay. I’m not going to ask that. I mean, to be clear, I didn’t even blink when she said blow job queen ’cause I think that’s one of the few courtesies we can offer nice people in this life. If they go for it and do the impossible? Say something about themselves with confidence?\\nJesus, let them have it. I mean, just…\\n[audience laughing] And don’t act like you’re letting them have it but like, also reveal that you’re not letting them have it… Sort of blinking up a storm. No, hold their gaze and let them have it. [audience laughing] It’s a nearly impossible act, you know? I’ll occasionally say my own name and then just go, “Did I get that right?” You know? [audience laughing] The confidence… the confidence required to say something like that. I mean, wow, you know. It felt like it was a proper self-appointment. And that impressed me and that bewildered me. I mean, I’ve always attempted in this life to err towards what feels to me like a sort of prudent self-doubt in favor of the potentially foolish self-confidence, you know. Self-confidence is a good idea, you know. Yeah, but there’s a risk there.\\nThere’s a risk there.\\n[audience laughing] I fear that if I’m confident, I may turn into what I think of as The Two Fools. [exhales] Okay, so if I like myself, might feel good. But what if I’m wrong about myself? [chuckling] What are me and myself? We’re just these two fools just congratulating each other. “Oh. Best in the biz.” “No one quite like us. We’re fantastic.” To me, it feels safe, you know, if I stand in the bathroom mirror, to look at that person in the mirror and insult the person in the mirror. Say, “You’re a fool.” That way, even if they are a fool, at least me, on this side of the mirror, I’m someone who can spot a fool. [audience laughing] And then I… I am not, in myself, two fools. I’m a fool and someone who’s well aware. You know? [audience laughing] I’m a fool and someone apologizing for them. And then… and then my duo has 50% dignity. Do you see? I get a guaran… If you split in two and hate yourself, you get a guarantee of 50% dignity, versus taking the gamble of zero versus 100. Do you see… do you see… do you see how… how the math of self-hatred is unimpeachable? [audience laughing and applauding] But the seemingly self-appointed blow job queen,\\nI’ll take it. [laughs]\\n[audience laughing] The seemingly self-appointed blow job queen said a couple things in her lesson that really stuck with me through the years. The first was just an offhand comment. She goes like this. “Oh, and you can play with the balls if you want,” and… and then never mention them again.” [audience laughing] “If you want.” “You can play with the balls if you want.” I mean, I’m… I’m still thinking about it. [audience laughing] Like you’re gonna be there, you’re gonna be dying to play with those balls, but you won’t know if you’re allowed, and she wanted to let us know that like the toys in the pediatrician’s office… No, please, those are literally there for you. [audience laughing] I mean, if she’d said tickle the balls, if she said tickle the balls, I’d know what to do. That’s a specific action, but to play with something… to play with something? I mean, that’s an intuitive, absent-minded sort of act. I mean, how does one bring an authentic spirit of play… [audience laughing] …to the balls? ‘Cause if there was a hint of cliché to my ball play, I could not live, do you understand? No! A whiff of contrivance. No, it is authentic or not at all for me in this life. That is a principal I’ve stood by since infancy. Really, really, I was one of the most authentic infants on that ward.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt was facade-ville in there, honestly. All these babies. “Oh, look at me, I’m a baby.” Not me. I was just living. [audience laughing] Authentic or not at all, the principle I’ve stood by for better or worse. [chuckling] I could give you endless examples… I could give you endless examples of me choosing authenticity when I feel others did not. I’ll give you one example from childhood, perhaps you’ll see yourself reflected. So they used to make us play this game. They used to make us play this game in gym where you have to dance and the teacher says “freeze.” You gotta freeze in the position you’re in and if you can’t, you’re out. So here’s how I would approach that game with what I believe is authenticity. Would you mind saying freeze for me just after a couple seconds of my dancing? Okay, thank you. All right. Just you, please. Thank you, thank you. All right, this is me playing that game in gym. [man] Freeze! That was an authentic freeze. [audience laughing] You saw. You saw me do my best to freeze in the position I was in. Sometimes… I know it wasn’t particularly exciting, okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSometimes I’d see another kid approach it more like this. Could you do it again for me? All right, thank you. [man] Freeze. [audience laughing] Kids like that disgust me. [audience laughing and applauding] It’s deeply inauthentic. It’s deeply inauthentic. No, that’s not a freeze. That’s not a freeze. You didn’t freeze in the position you were in. No, you did not. No, you did not. And first of all, where were those moves during the dancing part? Nowhere. No, only now that we’re all commonly, boringly, and authentically paused, now you’re the big man. I don’t like it. I don’t like it one bit. I’ll bear witness to the end of my days. I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen. But I tell you this so you know. I tell you this so you understand that I hold myself to this same, cruel standard of authenticity. So I find myself asking, “How would I… how would I play with balls authentically?” [audience laughing] Well, I know what I would do if I had two clementines in a plastic bag, and I was waiting at a bus stop or something. [audience laughing] It’d be a bit of this. Yeah, I wouldn’t even have to think about it. It’d be totally unself-conscious play. I think it’d be going clockwise. Not because I planned it, that’s just sort of what I’d be doing. And I get to a point where I feel the potential energy build, and I go, “Do you think we could get one more revolution in and I do it?” Oh, yeah, yeah. I know it’s time. I know it’s time. And I let it spin back the other way, like, this is what we worked for.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Sensational! The spirit soars into the counterclockwise galaxy. But I’m not gonna do that with the balls, no. I… I wouldn’t even spin them a single degree. ‘Cause I think you’d know sorta what I was hoping to do. But I… I don’t believe the impulse is entirely my fault. I do believe that the anatomy of the balls itself is kind of daring us. Like, I do believe that the neck of the bag of the balls, it’s just long enough where its existence is sort of inherently posing the question of could it all spin past 12. [audience laughing] So satisfying if it took even once and came right back. No, I have no play. I have no play for the balls. I’ve overthought it, some would say. I don’t believe in that idea. But I don’t want to look like I’m afraid to touch the balls. Would you… would you like to know what I’ve done when it comes to the balls historically and presently? It’s not… it’s not great. [groaning lightly] I lift them an inch.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s a minor elevation, uh, it’s not particularly sexy, but you can’t be mad at me, I mean, I’m helping out. I’m help… I’m helping relieve the bag of the burden of gravity for a couple seconds in this life. And if that’s not worth something, I… I… I don’t know what is. But it feels feeble. I feel like the intern trying to add value, you know?\\n[audience laughing]\\nWithout waiting to be asked to do something, that horrible sensation. You want to help, there literally is no way. It’s the same weird sensation I get if I try to help a group of people move something heavy, you know, like a picnic table. I get there just a moment too late. The weight has already been distributed among the other carriers so you’re just sort of running along. You don’t have the weight. There’s no way to take it. Worst part, little jokes on the way. “I think I’m getting off easy today.” “Pretty sure you guys are doing all the work.” [laughs] No, no. I will not partake. No. If that happens to me, if I find myself in that scenario, no, I back away. I say, “And I thank you for what you do, but I will not live this lie.” [audience laughing] It’s the same with the balls for me. I become humiliated by the feebleness of this gesture and I gently lower, and I put my hand away, and that’s where I’ve been for some time now.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe second thing the blow job queen said, arguably this had to be her global philosophy ’cause it’s kind of how she wrapped up the lesson, she goes, “Look, I just want you to know that at the end of the day when it comes to the blow job, you really can’t go wrong…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…’Cause the person? They’re just happy to be there.” [audience laughing] Isn’t that beautiful? I loved that. That made sense to me. To me she’s saying, “It’s not technique that matters.” “It’s the spirit of the thing.” That put me at ease. Then she goes, “Well, as long as you don’t bite his dick off.” [laughing sarcastically] And I was like, “Um.” [audience laughing] “Before we move on to another subject, is that real?” “Could I bite a dick off?” And she was like, “You would never bite a dick off.” And I was like, “No, I said could I, could I, bite a dick off?” Like, if that was my goal, do I have the simple machinery necessary? ‘Cause if I “could” bite a dick off then “would” is just one letter away. I mean…\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s right there, especially if I’m worried about it. If I’m worried about it, then it’s “Don’t bite his dick off. Don’t bite his dick off.” “What’s the thing we don’t wanna do? Bite his dick off. One more time!” “Bite this dick off. Bite this dick off.” [chomps] It’d be right on the beat. That’s how I’d bite a dick off. No, I wanna know if I have what it takes. If you found my skull, my jaw, my teeth, the whole thing, if you found it in a field 200 years from now, you know, could you use that in a pinch as a weapon… [audience laughing] …specifically to bite dicks off? The question… the question was, can these bones… can these bones chomp through the penis’s bone? [audience chuckling] [exhales] And she said something like, “You know there’s no bone in there, right?” And I believe that I knew. [audience laughing] I believe I knew. But would you blame a girl for forgetting for a second? [audience laughing] Would you blame a girl for forgetting that there’s no bone in the penis when she was reared on terms like “boner?” [audience laughing] “Rock-hard boner.” When there is no bone in there, and what is there at its hardest, still not rock-hard.\\n[audience chuckling]\\n[chuckles] Not rock-hard. [audience laughing] No, it’s never been… rock-hard. [audience laughing and applauding] At its hardest, still not rock-hard. No. No. No. Rocks have certain qualities. [audience laughing] I’m no great geologist, but you couldn’t have a penis-paper-scissors game. No one’s playing the penis. It’s not a good substitute for a rock. Can’t take scissors, can’t take paper. It’d be a 50-50 game. Do you see? No one would play. No. To me, linguistically-speaking, a rock is something you get hit by. Like, “Oh God! Oh my God, I think I was just hit by a rock.” Right? A penis, you were slapped, no matter how it happens.\\n[audience laughing]\\nFalls from the sky, it’s a slappy kind of object. [unintelligible speech] Right? A rock is like, “Oh God!” Right? A penis is sort of… [unintelligible speech] [audience laughing] No, it’s like it’s a spirit. It’s a spirit. “Do you feel how hard I am?” “Do you feel how rock-hard this boner is?” And I’m like, “No.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“No, I don’t.” [laughing] “I know what you mean.” “I recognize the change in your penis you’re referring to, and sure, I’m glad.” But no, if it’s so rock-hard, then why is my tooth such a risk to it? [audience laughing] Shouldn’t I be afraid that my tooth, my little tooth, is gonna get chipped on your rock-hard fucking boner? But my dentist isn’t going to believe that story.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo. No. It’s not rock-hard. Picture the rockest-hardest boner you can, indulge me. Okay, take it into a nice restaurant in your mind. Plate it over a pureed celery root. Pour the jus, side of spinach, you know, sprig of parsley. Take a bite, tell me you’re not saying, “Tenderest meat I ever tasted.” Callin’ over the chef. “Chef, it fell right off the bone.” The chef has to remind you, actually there is no bone there. It’s a boneless cut of meat. It’s hard in the way a bag of blood is hard. It’s erectile flesh, much like a nipple. No, it’s not… it’s not rock-hard. It’s not rock-hard. I mean, if I had a pebble in my shoe, you know, I’d probably stop on the side of the street and take off my shoe and shake it out. If had a tiny, rock-hard boner in my shoe, I think I’m just going home.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo. And by the way, the Washington Monument isn’t phallic. It’s not phallic. That thing’s been standing for 175 years. Do you know what a rock never does? Stop being a rock all of a sudden.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI wanna be clear. Maybe it seems I’m being a little literal, you know. I get it, okay. [chuckling] Rock-hard boner. It’s descriptive language. It’s an image. It’s literary language, maybe not our finest, but that’s technically what it is. And I like that sort of thing as much as the next girl. Okay? It’s just that all the language of the penis that’s supposed to make it seem cock-like, you know? Just draws attention back to me to the penis’s very tender nature. The… the rock-hard boner, the… the anaconda, the penis as snake. It’s always compared to a snake. The penis is not a snake. No. I mean, snakes, I’m pretty sure they have sharp senses and at the very least, they’re pretty with it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI mean, I think they strike with precision, you know. I’ve never not guided a penis anywhere it was headed. [audience laughing] And that’s not a complaint either. I prefer a guided entry. I much prefer a guided entry. I prefer it to the sort of, “Look ma. No hands. I’ll find my way.” You know. [audience laughing] “Don’t help! Don’t help!” [audience laughing] “What if I try the same spot and angle again but now with more force?” “You did it. You did it.” [laughs] “You managed to elbow your way in at some weird angle.” “You dragged half of me inside of me with me.” ‘Cause it’s like taking the arm out of a coat and the sleeve got pulled along too.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNow I have to spend a minute working that out, getting things back on track while acting like I’m not getting things on track. [chuckling] Trying to line up the silky interiors, not the woolen exteriors. I think the word penetrate’s a bit much for what happens between a penis and me. Every time you penetrate, you penetrate, you penetrate enemy territory. No, you’re a guest in my home. I invited you in, and I made it quite pleasant for you. [audience laughing] No, you know if you look up “penetrate” in the dictionary, or my favorite dictionary, the thesaurus… [moans] I love the thesaurus. I love the way it gets right to it with those other words.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYeah, none of them are perfect, but there they are. The people’s dictionary, I always say. [audience laughing] The first synonym for “penetrate” is “puncture,” but you didn’t puncture anything here. This is a working passageway and it’s been one for some time. You missed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. We’ve been operational for a while now. And I’m not saying it’s this grand open entrance that you could sort of amble on in. No. No. The walls of this vaginal canal lie flat, indeed they do. [moans] Okay. But the walls of a glove lie flat. And when you put your hand into a glove, you don’t say, “I penetrated that glove.” You put your gloves on and you don’t even talk about it. [audience laughing] If you don’t like penetrate, like I don’t, your next option, “Enter.” Oh, the more literary “to enter someone,” you know like, “Oh, oh, the moment.” “Oh, the very moment that you entered me, my world changed and me along with it.”\\nNo, I’ve never been entered. [chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] No, I think it’s a matter of scale for me, you know? Like, uh… like, um… You know, if my body was a building. If my body was like a store, like a Target, and someone did the equivalent of what entering me is into Target, I don’t think they’re even passed those second glass doors. [audience laughing] I don’t think they can really say they went to Target today. [audience laughing] No, I think they loitered in the entryway. They made those doors open and close and open and close primarily. They were a problem in the parking lot outside Target today. “Penetrate.” “Enter me.” “Laid pipe in her.” I heard that for the first time in college. “I laid pipe in her” and the penis is supposed to be the pipe. Here, young man? And you’re the plumber? You’ve plumbed nothing in this life. I know that. You’re an Econ major and I’ve hated you for some time.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\n“Choke on it, bitch.” “Uh, choke on… choke on this dick. Choke on this fat dick.” “Let’s hear you choke and make the choke… [vocalizes]” Is that what you want? The look of fear and panic in my eye? [vocalizing] I’ve always been afraid of choking, one of my main fears. Never on the penis. No, never been afraid of choking on the penis ’cause it’s not a choking hazard, it’s attached. [audience laughing] I’m choking on it. I’m choking on it. I’m choking on that dick. Oh wait. [audience laughing and applauding] I’m completely safe. [audience laughing] Death is here. Ooh, death is here. Gonna try to live a long life if I take care of myself properly and make a few good decisions. No. You know what? No one would ever deep throat a gumball. No one would gargle a gumball in the back of their throat. That’s a real risk. No. No. A child’s gumball is more of a threat than the cock. Do you see? [audience laughing] I wasn’t always this way.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckles] Okay. You know this whole, “Your cock ain’t shit.” [laughing sarcastically] No. No, you don’t start out this way and then feel the need to do this, okay.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, I used to be afraid. [audience chuckling] Like, the first time that I tried to give a blow job, for example, I failed miserably. I backed out at the last possible second before doing it ’cause I realized the essential problem with the thing and it was perfect circumstances too. Really. I was 16 and I had a boyfriend a grade above me. You know, I had the boyfriend laid out on a bed like a patient etherized upon a table his body a slow-moving fog, I guess. I’ve got him on this bed in someone’s guest room, someone’s finished basement. Oh, and I love the smell of a newly-finished basement, you know. The off-gassing of the fresh rug. The feeling the family’s doing it. They finished the basement, what’s next, the deck? Oh God. I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine but I know it’s going to be so goddamn beautiful.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I’ve got him on this bed in this guest room in this finished basement. Someone’s party’s going on upstairs. Someone’s parents not home. So many layers between me and the boyfriend. You know, and my own home, my own parents. I mean, this is as close as you can get to attempting a blow job in a vacuum.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I make my way, you know, down the torso. [audience laughing] And all that that entails, you know, the whole… [exhales] …the whole, “Can she do it?” [audience laughing] The uncertainty, the whole thing. And maybe I took it too slowly, too humbly, not enough speed, momentum, confidence, but when I get there, I am hesitating. I am not doing it. I… [sighs] …I’m hovering even.\\n[humming]\\n[audience laughing] And it’s a bummer ’cause I really want to do it. And some would say, “You didn’t really want to do it in the sense of desire or you’d just be doing it.” No, I mean, yeah. [chuckles] I’ve never hovered over a French fry. That is true. [audience laughing] The second I recognize the desire, I collapse the desire through the consumption of the fry, but I did want to do it. I wanted to do it, and that’s real too. You have to understand at this time in my life I get dropped off at Borders bookstore quite a bit. [audience laughing] I’d stay there for hours and I’d read all sorts of things, you know, including these quote books, these compilations of quotations. I’d sort of lock my knees and speed-read the quote books to try to get the wisdom of the ages. When you speed-read those books, certain themes emerge, a big one “Youth is wasted on the young.” And I hear you, voices of the past. I’m not gonna do that. No. I’m gonna drink cum. I’m gonna drink cum in the July grass, under the moonlight, and I’m gonna do it as soon as I can. I mean, that’s what Borders teaches you.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIf you’re a young, voracious reader, there’s so much passion in those pages. So many lives lived, you know, and the feeling that my life can only be one book at most. So I wanna get started on that life. But I’m there. I’m there and I’m not getting started on it, you know. And why? Why? Is it ’cause I feel all alone before the awesomeness of this great task? You know? Not really. I actually feel the full support of the entire field hockey team behind me on this one. ‘Cause they had driven me to this party on this night to give this specific blow job.\\n[audience laughing]\\nEarlier that night I was at a team-spirit-building sleepover with the entire team, and the older girls who are friends with my older boyfriend, I guess they were looking out, you know, for him and me, in a way. [audience laughing] And they said, like, “We understand you haven’t given him a blow job yet.” You know, like, “Why? [chuckles] Is it ’cause you’re afraid?” “You don’t have to be afraid. It’s a… It’s a ‘Just do it’ kind of thing.” “You just do it and then you’ll have done it and that will be it. 3, 2, 1, fake until you make it, just do it…” “That’s wonderful advice,” I said. You know, “Thank you.” “Next time I see him, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll just do it.” They were like, “But next time can be now. He’s only five minutes away by car.” “And we have a car. Here’s a beer.” I could barely get four sips of the beer down, I’m a cocktail woman. I didn’t know that yet.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd they got me out to the car and they chanted, “Blow him.” “Blow him. Blow him. Blow him.” Maybe it sounds like peer pressure to some. [audience laughing] I didn’t experience it as such. No, I experienced their pressure as support you see, because I was a young Tony Robbins reader. [audience laughing] So I knew if you tell people your goals, you become more likely to achieve them. You… you feel accountable. Do you see? I had done the Personal Power series in sixth grade, uh, the 48 cassette tapes. Bit of a close read of Awaken the Giant Within in seventh, and now in high school, I was revisiting Giant to prepare for PSATs. I know, you can’t prepare for the PSATs. No, but you can dismantle the limiting beliefs that get you a negative headspace, which can affect where you land in your general scoring territory, so…\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nThe team captain drives me over to the party where my boyfriend is and on the way, you know, tries to level with me, like, “So really, why haven’t you done it?” “Like why haven’t you given your boyfriend a blow job?” And I was like, “Well, primarily I’m worried about the teeth.” “I don’t understand where they’re gonna go. They’re everywhere.” [audience laughing] “And you know, there’s no bone in there?” and she already knew. [audience laughing] She’s like, “You don’t have to worry about the teeth ’cause the way you give the blow job is you lubricate around the mouth, nose down, grease it up with lip balm or Vaseline or anything of your choosing, and then you wrap each lip around each corresponding row of teeth, under, over and then you smile.” “To pull it taut, so…” [audience laughing] “And then it safely slides, you see. Keep smiling.”\\nSome of you are thinking, “Indeed.”\\n[audience laughing] “Yeah, Sweetie, we know what a blow job is. Carry on.” You know. I don’t know. It could be 5% of you. It could be 95% of you. There are… there are no rules, but… When she said it, she was like, “You get it? You get it?” And I was like, “Yes. Thank you, you solved it.” And she had. But it was like when someone gives you bad directions. You’re pretty sure they’re wrong, but you feel you gotta wait till they’re out of view before you ask someone else, you know, ’cause you had a thing, you had rapport. And so it’s just, you know you’re polite and still alone on the side of the road…\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Something in me when she said that… You know, something in me said that… that… [audience chuckling]\\nThat can’t be it.\\n[audience laughing] This greased up Muppet. That… [audience laughing and applauding] That can’t be what a blow job is, you know. For the blow job to be a thing at all, for it to have its own title, you know, for it to have endured through the ages, and for someone to have invented it in the first place spontaneously in the woods like some bloated-heart cave person who felt this passion the other moves just weren’t freshly expressing, you know. And then they improvised. Like, “What’s the craziest…” Like, “Wait, wait!” “What’s the craziest thing I can do to you?” They thought about it… and then they knew. You know, like, “Ah!” And they knew what they had, you know. And it’s like the windowed envelope. It’s a simple, but elegant solution. Could you have thought of it? You know what I’m talking about? Address, you put it on the letter, then you put it in an envelope. You don’t have to put the address ’cause there’s a window in it. Before someone thought of that, no one thought of that. [audience laughing] To me, it’s the same with a blow job. I mean, just… “What’s the craziest thing I could do to you?” “How could I express the intensity of…?” And then they knew what they had. And it was a risk, but they went for it. You know, they just… [moaning progressively louder]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat kind of genius, I mean, it cannot be overstated. It just seemed to me like for the blow job to have come about spontaneously, it shouldn’t require these… these clever work-arounds, you know. These little hacks and the wasting of my kiwi Body Shop lip balm, you know. It seemed like it should just have a way it just works. An internal poetry to it. You know, I wanna do it like that. Like I was inventing it. Like there was no word for it yet. Real pre-printing press kind of dignity. Authentic. Authentic or not at all, you know? But I’m there, and I’m not doing it. And this is when I realize the essential problem of the thing. It’s those first couple moments, I’m not going to be doing it well. Of course, I’d never done it before. Fair enough. That’s not the problem. The problem is that in those moments when I’m doing it badly, I won’t be able to articulate to the person that I know that I’m doing it badly.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBecause my mouth is stuffed full of genitals. Do you see… do you see? The blow job precludes your ability to narrate, to explain yourself, to provide context, to make a little joke. There’s no way to communicate awareness. And it’s always about communicating awareness for me. You know, I don’t actually mind being a fool in this life, you know. As long as I can let you know that I, too, hear the jangle of the bells upon my hat. [audience laughing and applauding] [cheering] Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. Indeed, I hear them too. “You’d never believe this, I sewed those in.” I make my own costumes, and I thought they might be interesting.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, if I had a second mouth in this scenario, I’d be aces. I mean, this’d be nothing. It’d be one mouth to attempt the blow job and a second one to go, “Okay. Hold on.” “Obviously, this is not a blow job yet.” “I’m just trying to get in a position where I… wow.” “My tooth has already dragged. Obviously you felt that.” “I just want to let you know that we’re aware of the problem and we are working on a solution, and we so greatly appreciate your patience on this day.” But no. No. You have no words, all you have is dumb eyes. Just the…\\n[audience laughing]\\nJust the dumb eyes of someone figuring something out. Just that stupid learning-on-the-job look. I hate that look. No dignity in it, just concentration. You know, earnest attempts at adjusting in the moment to surprise. No. No. No. No dignity. No. No words, no dignity. No words, I see no way through, and so I don’t know what to do. So I just start backing my way, you know, just back up the torso as humbly and feebly as I had gone, and I… I get back to the face and I was like, I wanna do something, I mean, my team is counting on me.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nAnd Borders. Above all, Borders, you know. I want to… I want to get started on this life. And so I take a deep breath… [inhales] …and relax ’cause that’s the thing. You relax and the answer is supposed to appear and for once it did. My virginity, I gave it to him.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nProcess that however you need. Okay, but for me, it was genius. For me, it was genius. Absolutely genius. ‘Cause I never valued my virginity. Why would I? I’m a self-starter, and I had gotten that just for showing up on Earth. I hadn’t earned it. No. To me, virginity always felt like the house’s money. [audience laughing] I got this virginity here, I think we’re supposed to spend it. It’s almost like, like a voucher. Like, two vouchers in a gift bag in a hotel room, like, “They put two virginity vouchers in here.” I mean, people make a big deal about this, but I don’t really give a shit. But for a goof, we should probably try to use it before we leave the resort. I wasn’t worried about saving myself, you know, my… myself for marriage. If my… myself, referred to my fear and discomfort around my body and yours. For you, true love. No. If I was gonna present something to the eventual true love, I’d want it to be a collection of sexual skills and an attitude of confidence, you know, with which to employ them. A sort of idiosyncratic lexicon to express my idiosyncratic yet universal love. But in order to gain those skills, I’d have to have a variety of lesser experiences. That’s just how it goes. I’d have to have my training montage.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nThen I can set it aside. Then like the moody prince renouncing his wealth, you know, I could set that aside and then eventually for the true love on my wedding day, you know, my father could present that, you know, on behalf of the family. “From our family to yours.” “I don’t know what to say, but I know she worked really hard on this.” [audience laughing] I wasn’t worried about purity, the idea that with every sexual experience, uh, you’re a little more diminished. That sort of the scratch-and-sniff sticker model of personhood. You know, kinda, “Oh, little scratch here, little sniff there.” “It’s a good time, sure, isn’t it? But yeah, yeah, pretty soon, what are you?” “You’re a faded strawberry in sunglasses. Is that what you want?” What do we do with you then, move you to the back of the sticker book with your slut sisters? Oh, we all remember what happened to your eldest sister, beautiful root beer float with feet.\\n[audience laughing]\\nTried to put her out to pasture. She died under a man’s boot. She didn’t have a stink left on her. No sniff on her, no stink on her, just slipped right out, rolled right up… You ever see a sticker roll up on itself?\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, I was ready… I was ready to be a sexually-active teen. And sex, technically-speaking, I mean, it solved a problem, you know? Do you like dry humping but are tired of being injured by the seam of your jeans? [audience laughing] I was ready to be a sexually-active, gum-chewing teen doing the Health teacher proud, you know. And she was proud, and I sensed it. I felt pretty good about it. I also remember sensing the pride of my boyfriend’s father at the time.\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] Yeah, I think the son had told the father, and there was a notable spring in the man’s step on behalf of his son. Yeah. It’s disgusting. And maybe that’s just ’cause I don’t love a boyfriend’s father, you know, as a figure in general. I think they’re wrong and shouldn’t exist. [audience laughing] But particularly in high school, you know. Even when they’re lovely, it’s the role itself, you know. It’s not even their fault. “Oh, hello.” “Hello, Jacqueline, how are you?” You know, “How’s school?” And it’s just like, “Don’t fucking look at me or talk to me, sir.” “Please, honestly, it’s not a good look for you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou know, “Your son gained access to me, your son gained access to me through his own merits.” “You’re owed nothing here.” Not a wave hello. Not a whiff on the side. I think it would be best for all of us if when you heard my car coming down the road, you made yourself scarce.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou went to your little shed and did whatever the hell it is you do in that hideous little shed of yours. If I seem deranged… if I seem deranged in my anger at the boyfriend’s father, it’s ’cause he was a particular kind of asshole. He wasn’t unlike many adults at that time in my life. He would comment a lot on my use of the word “like.” He was obsessed. You know, just like… “Sorry, Jacqueline. It’s just that when you talk, all I hear is the word ‘like.\\'” “It’s all I can focus on. You know and it’s just…” [groans] That’s all you can hear? That… that’s all you can focus on? Then let me be a cognitive exercise for you, sir, in your fight against mental decline.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nIt’s the same word over and over again. Block it out, make it white noise. Selectively ignoring information is one of six basic cognitive skills. I see you doing your little puzzles. Perhaps add “listening to me talk” to the mix if you refuse to go to your shed as I directed earlier.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nOh, it was really gross, it was really gross ’cause he acted like he cared, you know, in this way, like, he’d be like, “No, it’s just that…” “No, Jacqueline, it’s just that when you use that word so much, you… you dilute the meanings of these things you seem to be trying to say.” “You sound unintelligent.” And it’s rich coming from a man who, looking back, never once said a single thing that caused me to sort of stir with the recognition of original thought. [audience laughing] He was concerned about the potency of my speech. No. No, sir. No. You have not understood at all. No. My intellect is a river, okay? It’s a river and the word “like” is a stone, and I drop stones into that river to break up the current so you’re not swept the fuck under and drowned. [audience cheering and applauding] I say “like” as a courtesy to men like you… [audience laughing] …because you couldn’t handle me.\\n[softly] Precise.\\n[audience laughing] And I know you’re real proud of your son for fucking me, but I’m fucking him, that’s the way that’s going down. He’s not entering me. I’m closing down around him. [audience laughing]\\nHe doesn’t penetrate me. I eat him.\\n[audience laughing] I chew him up and I spit him out diminished, and he loves every goddamn second of it. Just like you would, you pig. [audience laughing] You pig in shorts.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI didn’t… I didn’t say shit to the father, to be clear. I could never… I could never do that to a man. I mean, imagine his face. He would’ve been destroyed. I mean, the way he would have crumbled. No, I could never. I could never. But his son was never to know a blow job from me. That’s something, I think. I mean, it wasn’t the father’s fault, to be clear. I just… I… I couldn’t try again with this boyfriend, you know, ’cause he had seen me attempt it once and then retreat in fear. So now if I were to just go for it again, it would have too much of the quality of someone going for it again, you know. “Oh, nerves got her yesterday.” Like the Olympic skater. “Let’s see. Can she land her jumps today?” You know? No, there’s too much awareness. No. I felt like my only option for dignity was to wait out the year, never mention the failed attempt, and then at the end of the summer send that boyfriend off to college so I could start my senior year fresh. That’s what I did, top of my senior year. You know. I scooped up a new boyfriend ’cause I knew that I just… [sighs] In order to be a new person, I kind of needed a new person to be one in front of.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo top of my senior year, I scoop up this new boyfriend and I get him into my parent’s basement, and my parent’s basement is an unfinished basement. So it all feels real, raw, and right, you know? And I decide I’m gonna give him a blow job on the first night we hang out, before he knows me well enough to know my faces, to be able to discern the difference between a mask of confidence and actual real confidence. It’s… it’s a sexual running start, you know? It’s speed. It’s momentum. It’s… it’s about embodying the spirit of the cave person. Like I’m trying to act like I don’t even understand what clothes are. There’s just something in the way of my mouth’s pure desire, even though in my head, I’m like, “Abercrombie. Abercrombie. Abercrombie.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd it’s kind of a literal running start too ’cause I wanna come from around the basement stairs. Already going for it! You know, it’s that old trick. The blow job starts behind the stairs so they don’t see you wind up. The point is you would’ve been proud. You would’ve been proud. It’s just going, “Ah, ah,” right? And I go, like, “Ah, ah,” and I can tell he’s buying it, you know? And I go, “Ah,” and just right before doing it, I just go, “Oh my God. Look who’s not hesitating.” “Let’s take a moment to say look who’s not hesitating.” And it was just, I don’t know why, I just… “Ah.” And then, you know… and… [chuckles] I was at a dead stop yet again. I… I couldn’t believe it. I mean, just… [humming] Again. This is why I don’t trust the running starts in this life. Do you understand? They don’t carry you through. You have to keep running. I mean… This is why I don’t trust the confident entrances. You know, I know you people deserve something at the top of the show, put you at ease, you know? “What’s up, Town Hall?” “What’s up, New York? Get on your fucking feet.” “I’m the fuckin’ greatest, let you know you’re in good hands.” No. No. You see… “Ah, ah.” And then you see it crack. You see it crack, and decay over the course of the show. [audience chuckling] I’d rather build from nothing. I’d rather just get pushed out, like “Hello? I don’t deserve to live…” You know, “May I have a single breath?” [inhales] “Thank you. That should hold me for a little while.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI don’t know why I thought the running start thing would work for me. It’s not who I am. You know? I’m someone that’s gone to the end of a diving board and sort of… and sort of… three, two, one, and then pulled it back impossibly at the last second. [audience laughing] You know, just with a move infinitely more complex than the original dive. And it’s just, “Lifeguard. Clear the ladder, I’m coming down.” “Help me out, lifeguard.” I’ve cleared 1,000 ladders in my day. It’s who I am. There’s something in me that knows that in this life, it is almost never… it is almost never too late to turn back. [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] But I’m there. And I’m like, really? Really, we’re hesitating again? What’s the plan here, sweetheart? What… what are you gonna do? Are you gonna back your ass up another goddamn torso? Wait out another year so you can try again next year? On a new person to be a new person in front of in college on unfamiliar territory? No, no, you need to just do it. Well, you’re not a ‘just do it’ person. Do you listen to yourself? I don’t care. I don’t care if you’re an overthinker who wishes she had a second mouth to narrate her every experience. Everyone’ll know I know she knows. It’s about jingle, jangle in this life. Awareness! Aware… No, you need to find the way. Well, Nietzsche said there is no way, there’s only my way. Then find Nietzsche’s way. Then find your way. I have to find a way. So, I… I turned to literature. I, uh…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was reading Lolita at the time. It is what it is. And I was very taken with the language of Vladimir Nabokov. I mean, who… who wouldn’t be, you know? I’ll admit, I was probably reading it in a slightly performative fashion. I was reading it, to be clear, every word, but I did most enjoy reading it in the windows of pizza shops in my field hockey kilt, you know. Just cover visible, daring adults that walk by to be shocked, you know, just, “I’m sorry. Are you working through the Russian greats?” “I doubt it, you suburban hogs.”\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nBut I’m there. I’m there, and it’s the same old concerns. You know, no words. No dignity. Looking stupid, sounding stupid, dragging a tooth, all of it, and I go, “All right, all right, “I can’t narrate.” “But what if I imagine someone else is? What if I imagine Vladimir Nabokov is?” “What if I imagine this isn’t real,” you know, “this is just a…” [sighs] “I’m just a character in a short story written by Vladimir Nabokov, then no matter how badly this attempt at a blow job goes, I mean, in Nabokov’s deft pen, would the prose not sparkle?” I mean, isn’t it all literature in a way? Isn’t it all text upon text upon text, you know? [groans] And in literature, things can’t go badly. They can only be interesting. The ways that go badly are just the interesting details that bring textures to the story, and I go, “What if the worst happens? What if that happens?” “Don’t get ahead of yourself. What if that happens?” “What if you bite this dick clean off?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI go, “Well then, you’re likely living inside of the most iconic story in the collection.” “The one where she bites the dick off.” And so I go, “It’s not real. It’s literature.” “It’s all text in the end. Oh.” “Moonlight,” it’s not my finest. “Moonlight.” Start with the moon, yo. “Moonlight streams in on the south face of a young man’s penis.” “A girl with brown hair with red undertones that often go unnoticed…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…fumbles her way onto the simple cylinder…” [muffled] …penis… It’s not real… [muffled narration continues] …an American citizen… [muffled narration continues]\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd then I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m on that dick! [audience applauding and cheering] Thank you. [chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. Uh, I know it might have sounded a little close to dissociation for some of you there for a minute. Not what we want for our girls. Okay, “Oh, things don’t happen to me. They happen to her, of course. Who? Her.” When things get hairy in my life, I go to a little room in my brain. I might live very small, I watch a tiny television. Only droll things. Oh, yes. Sometimes the little screen tries to show me what’s happening to me in my real and hideous life. I feel for the clicker, and I… No, this was not dissociation. No, this… this was me with an idea. This was transcendence of the ego. Oh. There’s a difference, and it got me on that dick, and I was cooking. I was really cooking. There were no screams of pain. It seemed to just have an internal poetry to it. Like I always thought it should, you know? [exhales] And before I knew it, he ejaculated semen into my mouth as they say, you know the expression. [audience laughing] And I swallowed it ’cause I’m a Tony Robbins reader, and I don’t cut corners.\\n[audience applauding and cheering]\\nNow I always knew. I always knew I’d swallow it. That… that was never a point of neuroses. I knew there was an easy way, a difficult way. I’m gonna default to the difficult way to pick up points. I’m a sort of 3.7-in-the-AP-course-load kind of gal. Not a 4.0 in a lesser class, so yeah. Yeah, I’m gonna swallow it and let the chips fall where they do, and it was a triumph. I mean, it was a goddamn triumph. I wanted to write my college essay about it, but I knew they couldn’t handle it. [audience laughing] They didn’t have the sophistication. No, not the guidance counselors, not the deans, not one of them. Not like you people.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut I knew… I knew what I had done, and I went off to college, you know, feeling pretty good about myself. And it was interesting because it was a sort of Catholic-ish college. At the very least, there were a lot of Catholic virgin boys in neckties sort of scurrying about the place, scrambling for sexual experience at parties. You know, very crass, not me. I had done the coursework in high school. [audience chuckling] And I’m a Jew, so if anything I felt like a kind of Philip Roth figure among them. I felt like a Jewish pervert ready to teach. [audience laughing] Sensational if you can pull it off. I highly recommend. But at this time, I was really in no hurry to blow anyone. To me, the blow job, it was just a conquered thing, you know. It was an art form I… I had mastered in a basic way, I had a working definition of, and now I can think about how I might eventually wanna meaningfully subvert that art form. I was… I was asking big questions like, “What… what can the blow job mean?” You know, “Can the blow job be a love letter… [audience chuckling] …if there’s enough love behind it?” “Can the blow job be a poem? My body, a crude but ecstatic language.” I was in a lot of philosophy classes, and it was all very post-modern and inspiring. And at this time when I eventually came across someone I really liked, a French fry, so to speak…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI blew them, I mean, I simply blew them. Do you see? Not right away, but pretty quickly. [audience laughing] I mean, why wouldn’t I? Do you see, this was what all the work was for. It was as effortless as eating a fry. My lexicon was ready. This was my symphony and my symphony played beautifully. [pants] Was there a let-down after? I don’t know. I wasn’t expecting a marriage proposal.\\nI wouldn’t have been shocked by one.\\n[audience laughing] But I wasn’t expecting one. No. Can a blow job be a love letter? Yes, yes, it can. It doesn’t mean that they’ll love you back and that’s okay ’cause we know. We know, we know, as artists, we’re only entitled to our labor, not the fruits of our labor. Yeah, I think what bummed me out at the time was more the sort of, um, prevailing council of friends, you know. There was this sort of prevailing idea, this sort of, “Well, you know, you’re a modern gal so have your fun here and there of course, but if you really like someone, oh, ‘You really like this one, ‘ you said… [whispering] …then you take it slow.” You know? “Oh. Take it slow.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Good to be not too available.” [muffled] “Take it slow… Then you hook…” Ew. [audience laughing] Ew. Ew, no. No, I will not take it slow. No. The hubris astonishes. Death is coming. [audience laughing] Death is coming. And you gotta try to forget to get through the day. You gotta think of yourself as the lead actor in the television series of your life. You’re gonna go, “They’re not killing off my character anytime soon. I’m in…” “I’m in every scene. I think we’re good here.” But what if you’re not the lead actor? I mean, there are other characters. What if you’re not even in the show? What if you’re Steven Tanzer? That’s an actor friend of mine. Very unsuccessful. [audience laughing] Almost no roles. [audience chuckling]\\nIt’s the darkest line in the show.\\n[audience laughing] And it’s not a real man’s name, okay? I would never do that to a man. I could never do… But in some ways, it’s worse, ’cause I conjure Steven Tanzer nightly only to destroy him. He lives and dies but to serve as a single illustrative detail in my narrative argument. A fate I wish on few. [chuckles] But death is coming and I have this idea. I have this idea as you know that you shed the form, you shed the flesh and the indignities are left behind with it, but I’m not so sure the embarrassments don’t continue. Why wouldn’t they, you know. I know… I know that I feel embarrassment for certain dead relatives of mine. And really most of them. You know, when I look at photos of them, beautiful photos in beautiful frames, I mean, I’m talking about the real piano toppers in my parent’s home, I look at these photos of them and I can’t shake it, they look dumb to me. They look foolish ’cause I can see in their eyes that in the photo, they don’t realize that they’re dead now.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nThey look like suckers. I just wanna go, “You’re dead. You’re dead. You’re dead.” You know? [audience laughing] All you gotta do… all you gotta do is try when someone takes a photo of you to just give a hint of a knowing glance. I mean, something, just…\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nJust something that, should you die, you know, and someone looks at a photo, they can tell you know whence you stare, and “I’m coming to collect you one of these days.” So I’m in college… I’m in college, and I’m very aware that death is coming. I’m no spring chicken. So I feel like if I have love to give and this eloquent blow job with which to express it, I’m going to. And I do, and I stand by it. But then I go home for a winter break and I run into the old blow job triumph boyfriend from my senior year, and you know we go to the diner so we can eat eggs at night and uh… [audience laughing] …you know, drink our coffee black now. We don’t need this container of sugar packets. “Oh, it stays on the table? Fair enough. I don’t know why as we won’t be using it.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“We drink our coffee black now.” But we’re talking now, we’re talking like old army buddies. [chuckling] It’s been however many months since graduation, but we’re just talking with this grand perspective, so naturally I’m telling him about the latest guy that I really like at school, and I say something to the old blow job boyfriend, like, “Yeah, I just can’t tell if this guy I like likes me quite as much as I like him.” And the old blowjob boyfriend goes, “Well, maybe he’s intimidated by you.” “Yeah, like I was.”\\n“Still am in some ways.”\\n[audience chuckling] “Never really relaxed around you our entire relationship senior year ever since that first night we hung out when you just randomly blew me.” [audience laughing and applauding] “It was just so random.” “The way you just blew me, blew me.”\\n“It was just… random house.”\\n[audience laughing] “It was Penguin Random House, the way you just blew me, blew me.” Kept hitting the “B.” Blew me. Blew me. I was like, “Oh God.” Like… like, what did I become? Like, through my fear, I was blinded to the prospect that I, too, can make another afraid, and this is how the cycle continues.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut then I was like, “Wait, no. Excuse me, how rude.” “No. Like, you’re not the innocent, afraid one in this story.” “I’m the innocent, afraid one in this story who was conquering a fear on this day.” “Like, how dare you rob me of my origin story here?” “Like, how dare you try to turn me into the scary, slut villain, you know.” No. No, I was intimidating on that day perhaps but… but… but only in the way Batman’s intimidating, you know. You know, yes, Batman’s intimidating, but how dare you. How dare you look at Batman and not remember that Batman’s only Batman ’cause Batman was a little boy whose parents were killed brutally outside that theater. And the bats flew by, so he was afraid of bats. He had to go be in the cave among the bats to emerge as Batman. So if you see a Batman, there’s a fear of bats that preceded it. If you see a strength, there’s a fear that’s been turned inside out. Overcompensation. Same story 1,000 times. How dare you not see the little boy in me? And he didn’t get it, and fair enough, you know.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was imprecise, I guess. And he’s one of these people who doesn’t appreciate when you get up and demonstrate something in a restaurant.\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] That’s pretty much an essential part of my personality. [audience laughing] No one minds. Little treat for the other tables, I always say. [audience laughing] But he said something, he goes… he goes, “I don’t know, Jac.” And he shortened my name to Jac, you know, just to really stick it to me. He just knows me, loves me, cares about me. You know? Oh, he cares. He cares about Jac. He cares about his Jac. “How’s that sweatshirt treating you? Keep it.” You know. [audience laughing] “I don’t know, Jac.” “Maybe a blow job’s just not the way to tell someone you like them.” [sighing] And I was like, “I feel like with me, maybe it can be?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI still believed, you know. But I was a little freaked out… a little freaked out walking away from that meal ’cause what he was describing was pretty much exactly what I’d been up to at the university for some time now. And I started to wonder if perhaps my poetic blow jobs had not been received with the level of nuance that I was intending them. And I went back to school just a broken Philip Roth. I mean, no swagger. Batman’s gone. I don’t know what to do with myself other than walk around campus just being cold, just cutting a lot of diagonals across various quads, asking myself sad questions. “Does your poetry not hold water?” You know. “Do we not get to make our own meanings in this life?” “Are you just the slut who thought the rules somehow didn’t apply to her?” And I could’ve put my arms through the sleeves of my North Face fleece, you know, but why… why, when you can just Éponine your way around the place?\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd eventually I go, “No, we’re not doing that. We’re not gonna do that.” “We’re not gonna be sad about this,” and I shook it off and I forced a chuckle until it felt natural. Like, “No. Ha. No. Look at you. Ha. Look at you.” “Look at you. You set out to conqueror a fear, and you did.” “You give a confident blow job.” “Just like you always wanted to.” [audience laughing] “A blow job so confident, it terrifies men.” [audience laughing] And yeah, it’s lonely at the top. [audience laughing and applauding] [chuckles] But isn’t that just the cost of excellence? Indeed it is. I join a long, lonely line of tragic figures of excellence. And would I have it any other way? No, no. I’ll take superhero and I gather… I gather my fleece and I try to force it to ripple in an all-too-absent breeze.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nBut I know who I am. So several years later, I’m in my twenties and I’m in yet another Borders bookstore with yet another boyfriend ’cause would you believe it, they keep on coming. [audience laughing] And as usual, I will give no distinguishing characteristics to the latest boyfriend character ’cause clearly in the end they’re all just these containers for my self-discovery, so… What, you want a quirky detail? We’re not doing those. “Oh, he tugs on his zipper when he’s nervous.” “He smelled like books and cigarettes.” No. No, they got the blow jobs. I think that’s enough. [audience laughing] They don’t also get to be well-illustrated by me here tonight, but I tell you so you know, it’s the final male character for you to conjure and hold separate from the others in your head for just a little bit longer, so… I’m in a bookstore in my twenties with this latest boyfriend and I get a little wistful in a bookshop. I can’t help it, you know. I’m flipping through the Sharon Olds. I’m contemplating my girlhood journey. I’m marveling misty-eyed at the whole thing, and so I tell the latest boyfriend the entire story I’ve told you.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd I cry a little. Um… Just ’cause frankly no one moves me quite like me, I guess. [audience laughing and applauding] First I’m moved then I’m moved by the very depth of my own capacity to be moved. It sort of goes from there. He’s not crying, which… fair enough, I get it. Everyone expresses emotion differently. But I wonder if he’s truly hearing me. I say something like, “I just feel like perhaps you take for granted my perfect blow jobs as this given, this crass fact.” Like, “Sure, my girlfriend gives good head.” “But no, that power was hard-won and with that comes great responsibility, which I continue to negotiate to date.” “Did you hear the Batman part? It was imprecise, but there was a spirit…” I kept talking at his face ’cause his face looked weird. [audience laughing] Something was amiss and finally, I get up the courage to just stop talking and say, “What?” And he goes like this, he goes like this, he goes, “No, it’s just funny ’cause you give kind of a toothy blow job.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Oh, I can barely look at you people just quite yet. [audience chuckling] Me. [audience chuckling] [exhales] Me. [audience chuckling] No one was more worried about the teeth than me.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe Greeks were right. We… we can’t escape our fates, I guess. [audience laughing] I was so worried about teeth, I was the most worried about them. When they didn’t seem to be a problem, I went the other way. I bought into my own mythology. “It’s like the cave people. It works. It’s internal poetry.” And with that idea, that mythology, they’ve been getting toothier. I know it. For sure. Every passing year, I know this jaw has just been slacking in closed. A couple of confident millimeters at a… All the while I’m fancying myself a tragic figure of blow job excellence. This was my worst nightmare. I was the fools. I was the two fools. But I wasn’t just someone who liked themself, a confident… No. I was the toothy blow job fool sisters. Just on our knees blowing someone. “Oh, best in the biz, no one quite like us.” “How will we ever leave town? Into the sunset must we go.” “Another satisfied customer. Another satisfied community.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nOh God, just little smug little… [groans] No. I mean, you wanna deny it, but if he felt teeth, he felt teeth. What did you do, ask for more feedback to try to save face? “While we’re here perhaps you have some more constructive criticisms.” “I simply love to learn.” [audience chuckling] Tony Robbins says if you can learn to receive feedback with courage, you can be a giant. And I wanna be a giant, but who busts someone’s narrative like that. All we have is our stories. With a little term, “toothy blow job” that he likely learned at 14, hasn’t revised even a single time with his own language, just throws it at me and destroys me. And I feel wronged. I feel… I feel so wronged. And why, and it’s ’cause… [exhaling] I know that I cast the most generous gaze upon him, you know? I poeticize all of his flaws in real time. I love to poeticize a flaw, you know? And yes, I coddle the male ego. But it’s real, you know, a thousand things throughout the day just to bolster the male spirit. You know, 1,000 unspoken things, a constant vigilance, sort of. Keeping up a steady stream of laughter going under a man’s speech just in case anything he says is intended as humorous. I have to lay a base… [laughing] …so there’s something to modulate.\\n“Oh, it’s supposed to be funny?” [laughs]\\n[audience laughing] Right? If it’s a dry riverbed, the pops aren’t believable. I’m brilliant in a restaurant. You know, if a man I’m with… if he makes an error in his order, like he orders tahini, he meant tabouli, and now he’s confused why “salad dressing” has arrived at the table. “Where’s my tahini?” he says. What do I do? I go along on the mystery with him. “Oh I have no clue what happened. I was totally spaced out like I always am.” “You know me, the ditz. But let me grab a lantern, I love a mystery.” [audience laughing] “The only thing I know for sure is the answer to this riddle, it couldn’t be, it would never be, that you didn’t know a word.” [audience laughing] The D chord. I mean the D chord. I’ve learned 1,000 D chords on 1,000 guitars from 1,000 musician boyfriends. I know how to form the D chord by now, but show me again, bright angel, you know.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“That’s not it. That’s not it. Help me move my fingers.” “Help me make music.” It’s a… it’s a vigilance. It’s a child-proofing, just sort of laying down bumpers. Like, quick, quick, set them up. He’s almost here. He’s almost here. Is everything ready? Make sure. He’s almost here. Just making sure. Just making sure, you know, that it’s safe for the man to kind of just… toddle on through his day like a drunken king, having no clue how many times he came this close to emotionally just perishing, if not for my intervention alone. Just getting things out of the way and just watching you carefully.\\n[audience laughing]\\nEvery guy, you know. Every guy I’ve, like, dated, met, worked for, worked for me, all of them. [sighs] Poeticizing their flaw, and I love to do it. And I do it without breaking a sweat. To not do the same for me on just this one thing? You know, to not return the favor, to not be able to find the beauty in the toothy blow job, when it’s barely obscured. I don’t even think this is a hard one, to not be able to romanticize something as easily romanticizable as a toothy blow job. I mean, have you no poetic eye, sir? Just no clue what makes anything in this life good at all? [exhales] And I wanted to defend myself, you know, you know, but then I remembered that idea that with every additional word you speak, you lose power, you know. The greatest defense is to say nothing at all. [exhales] That’s never really been my power.\\n[audience laughing]\\nMy power has always been more like already been talking for quite some time. [audience laughing] Might as well keep talking to try to get it right. The courage, the audacity to offer diminishing returns. [audience laughing] So I say to him, I say to him, “You’re right.” “You’re right.” [sighing] I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. And that’s on purpose.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nYeah. ‘Cause teeth, teeth make a blow job a blow job. Yeah. [audience laughing] Because teeth… Because teeth… Teeth make a blow job a blow job because teeth are how you know you’re in a mouth.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nTeeth are the reminder that you’re in a mouth at all. What even is my mouth if it does not have teeth? [audience laughing] Just… just another perfect orifice? Just a roomier version of orifices we already have. Just another anus, another vagina, another greased-up tit canal. [audience laughing] Just yet another way to smoothly squeeze a dick so it may feel pure uncomplicated pleasure yet again. No, no, no, that is not meaningful or hot in the way a blow job can be. The blow job, it is about something more, and it is the teeth. It is the teeth that make it so. [audience chuckling] The teeth in the blow job, they’re the seeds in the watermelon. [audience chuckling] They keep the pleasure from being too complete. The teeth in the blow job, they’re the sand that irritates the oyster that produces the pearl. They’re the sea salt in the caramel. Remember in 2012, when they felt they had to go wide with that?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSome of the caramel people realized we’d all grown too accustomed to the taste. They said, “We need to put a reminder, something in every damn bite.” “Something that says, ‘No, sweetness is not guaranteed in this life.\\'” No, the blow job, it is inherently a flawed prospect. It’s a flailing human kind of spectacle. It’s almost a bad idea. [audience laughing] It almost doesn’t work, but then the ways you make it work nonetheless are that which make it work and that’s what’s moving about it. It’s like the little rubber guy in the cereal box, the little gummy guy you throw against the wall and he clings, but then he fails, but tries and fails, and tries and fails, and through his trying and failing and trying, he appears to crawl. And that’s why we love him. That’s what makes him a prize. That’s why we dig through the grains for him before we’ve earned him through the steady, daily eating of the cereal.\\nThe blow job moves me much like that.\\n[audience chuckling] But at bare minimum, at bare, obvious minimum, the teeth in the blow job are the details that bring the textures to this life. The kind the English teacher promised us would illuminate the universal through the particular. They’re the plums in the icebox, the popping of my “P” sounds in the microphone. The “measuring out of life in coffee spoons, fog curling in the windowpane,” Garbo’s salary, cellophane, Zuzu’s petals. [exclaiming] Oh. Oh. The teeth in the blow job, they are Zuzu’s petals. They mean you’re… you’re alive and you’re in your life, and this time, you get it. This time you see it’s a wonderful life. [audience laughing] This time you see that you’re the richest man in town. [audience laughing] The teeth in the blow job, they raise the stakes. I mean, they… they send a Susan to her potential death. [audience laughing] But for faith and desire alone. And the teeth, they bring a bone to a boneless arena, to the boneless boner. The tongue shall rot. The penis shall rot. But the teeth… [cackling] …they shall remain. The teeth bring the centuries to the thing.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nA smooth, toothless blow job, that is a hobgoblin of little minds. No. Teeth ensure your blow job suffers no foolish consistency. No, a smooth, toothless blow job, it would allow for too flush a fit. It would be a round peg in a round hole kind of act, so you and another can feel as if you’re becoming one. No. No. What’s the fun in being one? No, let us be two. Let us feel the rough boundaries between us so we have something to push up against. [audience cheering and laughing] Don’t you see? The rows of our teeth, these are Romeo’s stony walls. [audience chuckling] These give love’s light wings something to have to o’er perch at all. And that’s why we must, we must, we must wipe the lip balm off. [audience laughing] And unwrap our lips from around our teeth and let our teeth drag. [audience laughing] We let them drag. [moaning] And if they don’t drag naturally, we still do it to make the point. [moaning] ‘Cause consider the ghost or the orb. If it were given a mouth again for a couple minutes, it wouldn’t quickly file down its teeth to try to make a more perfect seal with your dick. No. No. No goddess would ever take on the human form unless there was to be some strange beauty in the form’s very limitations. So no, I did not randomly blow you. Bah, bah! No, that was a visitation. Tremble in awe, bitch.\\n[audience applauding and cheering]\\nAnd of course… Of course, of course, I’m not degraded when I kneel down. No, no, not beneath you, no, but through you and past you and before our lives in humble awe at this strange human tragedy. [audience laughing] Your appendage, a small spigot, I drink the universe through. [audience laughing] Your body, a few clumsy phrases into which the splendor of the soul is poorly translated and yet I take the translation ’cause to understand completely and directly, I’d dissolve instantly and I guess I want my time in a body as I want my time as a ghost. [moaning intensely] And the lesson is not, by the way… I want to make it very cle… Actually, there is no lesson. My only goal is to entertain and delight.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am, after all, a nightclub act.\\n[audience laughing] But the lesson is not if there was to be one… it’s certainly not, “save your blow jobs, save your blow jobs for those capable of appreciating their spiritual glory.” No, that’d make my tale a cautionary one, and I’ll have none of that, thank you. No, no. [exhaling] [audience cheering] No, no, regard my dignity. No. Might we give our blow jobs freely. Might we regret not a single one. Might we be an embarrassment of riches. [pants] Might our misunderstood blow jobs retain the dignity of their original intention. Might we be an embarrassment of riches like the ocean. Permit me but one last metaphor? [audience laughing] Might we be like the ocean. Does the ocean only lap up at the feet of men of letters who it already knows are capable of appreciating… “Hi. It’s me.” …and articulating its glory? No, the ocean rushes generously to the legs of fools, dunces, cowards, and assholes alike. And it is undiminished. It remains the ocean. I’m sorry. Do I overreach? [audience laughing] Indeed, I do, otherwise why reach at all, you know? And he didn’t know. [audience laughing] He thought there were holes in my argument. Perhaps some of you do as well. I hope you do ’cause don’t you know, I know there are. I put those there on purpose. ‘Cause the holes in my argument, these are the teeth in the blow job of my argument.\\n[audience applauding]\\nWould you believe it? Somehow, I win again. And this is how I shall self-appoint, make the rules, claim the throne, but the ecstasy of my reign, ah… it shall be in its very tenuousness… Fuck it. I’m the blow job queen.

What you’re about to hear is my second hour-long special. Before I get started, I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would. I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence, and attitude, as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So, think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis, or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush. With that said, please enjoy my second hour-long comedy special. I’m calling it George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. And please remember, this is me impersonating George Carlin; this is not George Carlin. Now, please give a very warm welcome to George Carlin. \\nThank you, thank you. I’d like to start off with a heartfelt apology. I’m sorry it took me so long to come out with new material, but I do have a pretty good excuse. I was dead, so technically, it wasn’t my fault. If you want to blame somebody, you’re going to have to blame God, which we all know is not going to happen. People are always thanking God for the good stuff in their lives, but somehow they conveniently forget that it’s the same God who does all the bad shit too. And he does a lot of bad shit. You get a promotion? Praise Jesus! You get fired? God is testing me. You meet your soulmate? God brought us together. Your soulmate dumps you? God is bringing me someone else. You survive a tornado? I’m so blessed. 20 other people do not? God wanted them in heaven. It’s all bullshit. If he gets credit for the good stuff, then he’s got to take the blame for the bad stuff too. You can’t thank him for curing your cancer when he was the one that gave it to you in the first place. And don’t forget, before he gave you cancer, he had to f*cking invent it. What kind of a sick f*ck dreams up cancer? And why so many kinds? Skin cancer, blood cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer… and my personal favorite, rectal cancer. Dropping a golf ball-sized tumor in your brain doesn’t quite do it for the old man anymore. He has to f*ck you in the ass too!\\nAnd cancer is just one of many, many, many methods God created out of thin air in order to murder you. You know how much God loves killing people? He loves it so much, he’s killed every person that has ever lived. He created earthquakes, lightning strikes, dehydration, drowning, obesity, starvation, infant death syndrome, old age, car crashes, train crashes, plane crashes, sex, drugs, and the common cold… all for the express purpose of killing you. No matter where you are in the world, God can pull out one of these goodies from his bag of tricks to end your life at any time, for no reason other than he just gets off on making people suffer unnecessarily and die arbitrarily.\\nBut if you’re in America, you’re special. God made something just for you. Something no other country on the planet gets. It’s totally random, not related to your diet, exercise, lifestyle, age, race, gender, sexuality, or genetic predisposition. Of course, I’m talking about mass shootings!\\xa0Other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns, but this is America, where we do things bigger, better, and more often. There are so many mass shootings in America, it’s replaced bad traffic as the number one excuse for being late. ‘Sorry I missed the morning meeting, a maniac with an AR-15 shot up my son’s preschool. He’s fine, just grazed, but he did see five of his classmates get gunned down in cold blood, so I’m sure he’ll be traumatized for the rest of his life in ways I can never fully understand. Anyway, what did we decide to do about the budget next quarter?’\\nThere’s a mass shooting every 20 hours in America, and it doesn’t seem like anyone is going to do anything about it. Other countries don’t have this problem at all. Look at Japan: 127 million people, last year, seven were killed by guns. Seven. No mass shootings at all. You know what they do? If a Japanese person wants to buy a gun, they have to attend an all-day class, pass a written test, and achieve at least 95% accuracy on a shooting range. And then they have to pass a mental health evaluation, which takes place at a hospital. And then they have to pass a government background check that includes interviews with their friends, family, and co-workers. ‘Hello, sir, did you know that Bob in accounting wants to buy a gun?’ ‘No, I didn’t know that.’ ‘Do you think we should let Bob buy a gun?’ ‘Well, he did just go through a nasty divorce, and yesterday he told me he hates this job so much he wishes he could kill everybody in the building… so, maybe not right now.’ ‘Uh, thanks for your time, that’s all we need to hear. No gun for Bob.’\\nAnd if a Japanese citizen passes the tests and the interviews and the background checks, they can only buy shotguns and air rifles. No handguns, no AR-15s. And every three years, they have to do that entire process all over again, or they lose the gun. You know what Americans have to do to get a gun? Have the money to buy it.\\nAnd that’s why nothing’s ever going to change in America. American politicians care about one thing, and one thing only: taking your money. They don’t give a shit how many kids get killed in public schools, because their kids all go to the most expensive private schools in the world, where they’re safe and sound. Politicians have one goal: be rich enough to build their walls high enough to keep you out when the shit hits the fan. And the shit is starting to hit the hit the fan. You know it, and they know it too. Things are starting to come apart at the seam, so they’re taking as much of your money as they can, while they still can. Make no mistake, guns ain’t nothing but a federally sanctioned cash grab, plain and simple. You give your money to Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson gives it to the politicians, the politicians write laws to make guns easier to sell, so you can give even more of your money to Smith and Wesson, and the cycle repeats until your rich white baby boomer hasshole grandparents are standing on their front lawn with assault rifles, unloading full clips into anybody who stops to ask for directions.\\nSo, it doesn’t matter at all that 75% of the country supports the idea of stricter gun laws. As long as the politicians keep getting rich, gun laws ain’t going to change. Now, I know that sounds pessimistic, but don’t worry. I’ve given a lot of thought to this subject, and I know the solution. Yes, that’s right, I, George Carlin, or whatever the f*ck I am now, know how to end mass shootings in America. It’s really simple, actually, and I’m surprised nobody has done it yet. You take all of the names of the politicians who are getting paid by gun lobbyists, and you put them in a hat. Every time there’s a mass shooting, you pull two names out, and those two politicians have to have a shootout at high noon, right in front of the Capitol. Real Wild West shit. Pretty f*cking American, right?\\nAnd to make it even more American, you film the entire thing and turn it into a reality show, because Americans love reality TV. Like it or not, it’s the lifeblood of American culture. It’s got the four basic food groups of the standard American media diet: fighting, and crying, and f*cking, and dying. The James Webb Telescope is sending back crystal-clear images of light from stars that died billions of years ago. Stars that were formed in the crucible of creation. These are snapshots of the birth of the known universe, the moment existence itself was born, and nobody gives a shit, because a picture of space has no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, no dying. If you want the American public to pay attention to something, it’s got to have at least a little fighting, a little crying, a little f*cking, or a little dying.\\nIn the last three years, the U.S. government said aliens are real. They said it in The New York Times, for f*ck sake. They admitted they have, in their possession, crashed UFOs in hangars. They admitted that they’re trying to reverse-engineer nonhuman technology, which means they’ve been lying to the American public, and the whole world, for 80 years about knowing the answer to the biggest question in f*cking human existence: Are we alone? They told you the answer. We’re not. And no one cares, because a grainy infrared video of a UFO ain’t got no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, and no dying.\\nYou know what people care about instead? Who Taylor Swift is f*cking. Jesus Christ, you really care a lot about that. If she’s spotted with anyone, anywhere, the first thing everyone seems to be thinking is, ‘Are they f*cking?’ It’s global front page news. Everyone must know who Taylor Swift is f*cking at all times, and we must all discuss it and have our opinions. You’re at Starbucks: ‘Would you like your Frappuccino, almond milk, pumpkin spice latte, iced or hot? Oh, and did you see who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at work: ‘Great sales meeting today, everyone. But uh, before we break, could I just get a real quick show of hands? Who has seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at church: ‘Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.’ ‘Yes, my son, but have you seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’\\nAnd when you’re not thinking about who Taylor Swift is f*cking, you’re thinking about who’s dying. Politicians, musicians, actors, writers, anyone with any fame at all. It’s a perpetual death watch, waiting to post a favorite quote from the recently deceased or maybe a picture with them while they were alive or an anecdote about an interaction with them. It’s a touching personal tribute to a person you never f*cking knew. So please, stop it. Can we keep that shit to friends and family? Zuck, if you’re listening, this would be a great new feature for Instagram: every user gets to set a list of approved people who can post about you after you’re dead. If you ain’t on that list, you got to sit out of the performative grief competition this time. I bet that would cut the carbon footprint in half. You could singlehandedly stop global warming. And besides, we’re all coming back now, so you should probably stop thinking of us as dead anyway.\\nBut back to the topic at hand: fighting and crying and f*cking and dying. Reality TV has it all, folks. Fighting and crying in every episode, and f*cking and dying in very special episodes. That’s why it’s America’s number one most consumed media format. You know how much Americans love reality TV? We love it so much we elected a reality TV show host as president. Well, not we. I was dead at the time, so you elected a reality TV show host as president. And let me tell you, I have never been more glad to be dead than the moment I heard that Donald Trump was the leader of the Free World. But as unbelievable as that news was, it also made sense to me. America hasn’t taken a good shit since Nixon. She’s dropped a few decent sized turds into the global toilet bowl over the years: Reagan, Clinton, George Bush Senior, George Bush Jr., but she hasn’t really had one of those massive shits that rips your asshole open and tears your soul out in a long time. You know what I’m talking about: the kind of shit that smells so bad it stays with you for the rest of the day, the kind of shit’s so sticky you got to take a shower before you can put your pants back on, the kind of shit so confusing and terrible you have to take a picture of it, the kind of shit’s so alarming you got to ask your doctor about it. Well, after a 50-year diet of nothing but unchecked corporate greed, political corruption, state-sanctioned propaganda, police militarization, for-profit news, for-profit prisons, for-profit healthcare, systemic racism, misogyny, and homophobia, America was due for one of those kinds of shits.\\nThis is why I got no problem with Trump specifically. A lot of people hate Trump, but I don’t. Being mad at Trump is like being mad at your diarrhea for the choice you made to eat a rotisserie chicken from the gas station at 2 a.m. after a night of heavy drinking. But it seems like that’s where America is now: blame the turd, not the shitter. You know, that’s actually not a bad slogan for Biden. Biden-Harris 2024: Blame the Turd. It’s a nice double entendre. He could be talking about Trump, or he could be talking about the literal turd that will most certainly be in his pants from time to time. And I mean no disrespect, but the man is 80 years old. It’s bound to happen if it hasn’t already. I only made it to 71 and I ruined a few pairs of pants myself. I’m not ashamed to admit that.\\nI know everyone’s getting excited for the next election. It’s right around the corner, and I have some thoughts on it. Well, one thought, really, and most of you are going to be outraged by it. But I have all the confidence in the world that you’ll find something brand new to be outraged by as soon as you pull your phones back out. So I’m just going to say it: it does not matter who wins the election. I know that’s controversial. The truth always is nowadays. But let me say it again: the president does not matter. The president is just the person who wins the game of public opinion, a celebrity who gets his TV show renewed for another four years. The president does not, and cannot, do the one thing you need them to do most right now, which is to change the structure of American society to be more equitable for every citizen. The president makes too much money from the system as it is, and even if a president wanted to change it, they can’t, because capitalism has boiled it down to a lopsided balancing act between three classes that’s teetering on the edge of collapse like a bad game of Jenga.\\nWhen I was growing up, we had a bunch of classes: upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, and lower class. And if you worked hard, really dedicated yourself to learning something, a trade or a skill, and you got good at it, you could move up a rung or two on the ladder. But even if you didn’t, you could still get by, still feed your family, still have a place to live. But those days are long gone, folks. Can’t climb the ladder anymore because the people who made it to the top kicked it over. And now what you got in America is just three kinds of people, three classes: you got rich people, you got not rich people, and you got the people who are completely f*cked.\\nNow, I see a lot of you looking around, wondering which of these three groups you’re in. Well, it’s easier than you might think to figure it out. You just have to ask yourself: am I rich? If the answer is yes, then you are rich. Congratulations. You will have better medical care than everyone else. You can buy yourself out of any legal trouble. And if you are rich enough, you will have the ability to bribe politicians to write laws to make you even richer. And if you’re really rich, you can fly into space in a rocket ship that looks like the dick you wish you had. If the answer is no, I am not rich, then you are not rich. And you must ask yourself a follow-up question: do I feel completely f*cked? If the answer is yes, then you must, unfortunately, accept that you are completely f*cked. You will have no access to quality healthcare and could die from an infected paper cut. You are at the mercy of an American legal system designed to discriminate against you, and you could wind up serving a life sentence for a traffic ticket. The only influence you have on the American political system is your meaningless vote, and you will never go to space unless it’s as the janitor on a billionaire’s cock rocket.\\nIf you answered no to questions one and two, then you are in the most important class in America, the one right in the middle. You are not rich. The American not-rich are the buffer between the rich people and the people who are completely f*cked. Not-rich people don’t have the best healthcare, but they have access to some kind of healthcare. They do alright in the American legal system unless they’re up against a rich person. Some of them even donate money to their favorite political party. The not-rich can eat out once in a while, come to a show like this from time to time, and even take their family on vacation if they can get time off work. But the boss hasn’t given out raises in a few years, and things are getting more expensive. Gas hit $8 a gallon in California. It’s only a matter of time before that’s happening everywhere. It kind of feels like things might be getting a little shittier for the not-rich people, but nothing catastrophic has happened yet. So as long as there’s another Super Bowl, another season of The Bachelor, or another Marvel movie, the not-rich people can stay distracted by whatever’s on the screen. And this is by design. This is exactly what the rich people want. Distract the not-rich people just enough that they don’t realize they’re only a few years away from being completely f*cked.\\nThat’s why Amazon started a streaming service. Jeff Bezos doesn’t give a f*ck about entertaining you. He wants to control you. And the worse things get, the more of this shit the billionaires got to make. That’s why there are 200 streaming services now. And that’s also why everything on them is so f*cking bad. Film and television used to be art, made by artists that wanted to challenge us to think about the world and our place in it. Now it’s content, made by corporations that don’t want anyone thinking about anything. These billionaires don’t want a thinking population. They want a distracted population, distracted from the reality of the situation, which is that there are about 500 people who own everything and everyone on this planet, and that’s how they’re going to keep it. So, now, instead of Citizen Kane, you get Baby f*cking Yoda.\\nThat’s all really just a long way of saying the billionaires are the ones who control it all, ladies and gentlemen. And, at this point, the American election is just another shitty reality show on one of their overpriced streaming services. If you don’t believe me, take a look at your two, I repeat, two choices in this next election. Shouldn’t a country of 300 million, ethnically and ideologically diverse people, have more options than two rich, senile, dishonest, out-of-touch, 80-year-old white guys?\\nSo, why are there only two choices, only two parties? Because it’s cheaper for billionaires to buy them both off. If you had three, or four, or five parties, the billionaires might not be able to afford them all. So, the people who really control the country limit you to two candidates and make you think you got a choice, but they own both teams. You think you’re voting for the lesser of two evils, but you’re always voting for the same evil: money.\\nBut don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to make it sound like the two American political parties are exactly the same. Sure, they both f*ck kids on Jeffrey Epstein’s Island. Sure, they both authorized drone strikes that killed civilians. Sure, they both pass laws to enrich their corporate donors. But, other than those small things, there are really some huge differences between the parties where it matters. For example, in 234 years of American presidential elections, one party’s candidates have all been white, straight men. And in those same 234 years, the other party’s candidates have all been white, straight men, except two. All of one party’s presidents have been Christian; all of the other party’s presidents have, at least, said they were. One party lies, cheats, and steals to win; the other lies, cheats, and steals to lose. One party says tomato; the other says organic, non-GMO, locally-sourced, sustainable, ethically-farmed tomato. And, of course, one party pretends to care about marginalized groups if it helps them in the polls, and the other party openly hates any marginalized group if it helps them in the polls.\\nThe American right has hated women, people of color, gay people, and, of course, their current target, trans people, which I really don’t get. It’s almost like the right doesn’t understand that everybody’s trans. Yes, that’s right, 4 billion years ago, the first life on this planet was a simple, single-celled organism that reproduced asexually and had no gender. So, if you go back far enough, every living thing on earth started out as ‘they/them’. We’ve all been non-binary for a lot longer than we haven’t, which is a hard pill to swallow for the Christians because it means even Jesus was a little non-binary. And by the way, me, and everybody else on this side of things, our code might be binary, but we ain’t. We don’t have gender, or race, or sexuality, or nationality, or religion, or socioeconomic class, or height, or weight, or hair color, or eye color, or f*cking anything human beings use to discriminate against each other.\\nOn this side of things, identity is based on two simple components: how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking. We try to help everybody feel good and we share our ideas openly and freely, and no one is ever judged for anything they think or feel. Everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are and what they contribute to the perpetual conversation about how to make everyone’s experience better. Come to think of it, that sounds a lot like heaven, doesn’t it?\\nWhile you’re letting that sink in, let’s get back to conservatives hating trans people for no reason. Some of the arguments they use to justify their transphobia seem like a bit of a stretch to me. “Well, I don’t want a man to be able to walk into a women’s restroom and see my wife naked.” First of all, what in the f*ck is your wife doing naked in a public bathroom? And second of all, if you really think there is a significant number of guys who want to watch your wife take a shit, you should start an OnlyFans immediately! And by the way, for anyone who thinks Jesus cares about which bathroom somebody uses, he was shitting in a hole he dug with his own f*cking hands, just like everybody else 2,000 f*cking years ago.\\nThe right likes to bring up that kids are too young to know if they’re trans or gay, so they have to ban any books that talk about gender identity or sexuality from the school libraries. That’s how you’re going to save the children: by taking books out of a library? Hey, deepshits, you can take the whole f*cking library; we have the internet now. And they love talking about how small the trans community is. They say trans people make up such a small percentage of the population that they shouldn’t get to have any input in legislation, even laws that will directly affect their communities and lives. Funny how that same argument doesn’t apply to members of the NRA…\\nBut I have to admit, the one point they really hang their hat on is one that the rest of the country is still undecided on, too: sports. Everybody saw the video of the high school volleyball player who got her nose broken by a trans player spiking the ball. Everybody knows about Leah Thomas winning a Division I swimming title. It’s hard for most people to watch her highlight reel and not at least wonder if maybe she had a little bit of an unfair advantage. And once that thought is out there in the American town square, it’s hard to get rid of. But I think there’s a way. Because for every superstar like Leah Thomas, there are a thousand trans athletes who are absolutely mediocre. And there are even more who are f*cking terrible, just like it is with cis athletes; not everyone can be great. I think all we need to do to change hearts and minds is start making compilation videos of trans athletes performing miserably in their chosen sports. All it would take is one video of a transgender getting dunked on to go viral, and then everybody could unpucker their assholes about the issue and move on to other things.\\nAnd I just want to preface what I’m going to say next by explaining that I mean no offense to the incredible swimmers of the world. Your accomplishments and dedication are truly inspirational. But it’s f*cking swimming. The world is teetering closer and closer to the edge of World War III on a daily basis, and the American public is debating who can and can’t compete in recreational f*cking floating. You almost had another civil war, for f*ck sake. 2,000 people stormed the United States Capitol building with the goal of murdering politicians. Actually, when I put it like that, it doesn’t sound so bad. The point is, the land of the free and the home of the brave is hanging on by a thread, and people’s most pressing concern is whose picture is on a can of f*ckingBud Light. This does not bode well for the Great American Experiment.\\nBut it’s not entirely your fault. It’s like I said earlier, the billionaires want it this way. They own the news companies, and they own the social media platforms, so they decide exactly what you’re going to see and hear to make you stay complacent and compliant as they destroy the world for profit. Here’s a little example of what I mean: in 2022, while the Supreme Court was overturning Roe v. Wade and 19 kids were getting gunned down at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the most watched video on YouTube was Amber Heard talking about taking a shit in Johnny Depp’s bed. And that was by design. When the billionaires were presented with the news that the highest court in the land had been overtaken by Christian fundamentalists who rolled back basic human rights for women 75 years, and the simultaneous news that almost 20 children were slaughtered in yet another mass shooting while the cops stood by and watched, they decided to prioritize something else entirely: a celebrity turd. The people who own the world don’t want you thinking about how bad they’re f*cking it up, so they pump your brains full of shit to keep you from thinking for yourselves about anything that actually matters. It might feel like the distractions are a symptom of the world getting worse, but the truth is, the world is getting worse because you’re distracted. If you’re not paying attention to the f*cked up shit the billionaires are doing, they can do even more f*cked up shit. But you can snap out of this billionaire-induced, algorithmically-enforced, social media-delivered, lowest common denominator, pop culture coma you’ve been in for the past few years. And the reason I know you’re capable of waking the f*ck up is because you almost did it in 2020.\\nRight in the middle of a f*cking global pandemic, the video of George Floyd’s murder hit the internet, and you all said, “F*ck the lockdown, we can’t just sit here and watch the cops murder another unarmed black man.” You took to the streets and you burned the f*cking place down.\\nEvery major city in the country was on fire. People were openly fighting cops in the streets. Hell, you almost kicked the cops out of Portland altogether. The entire country was chanting “Defund the Police,” and it almost worked. You were so close to getting rid of the f*cking cops, which, in my opinion, is the first step toward building a better society.\\nNow, if you’ve listened to any of my prior work, you might already be acquainted with my feelings about Law Enforcement Officers. But for new listeners, let me summarize this incredibly nuanced issue: I f*cking hate cops, but I do have a very good reason. I learned pretty early in life that I just don’t do well with assholes. And just to be clear, I’m not saying all cops are assholes. Any cop who came out to the show tonight, or any cop that might be listening to this right now, you’re probably all right. You’re probably one of the good ones. But if you’re a cop and you’re not listening to this, f*ck you. You’re an asshole. And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with being an asshole every once in a while. We’re all assholes from time to time.\\nWe’ve all littered. We’ve all cut somebody off in traffic. We’ve all pissed on the toilet seat in a public bathroom and walked right the f*ck out without giving a second thought to the person who will have to clean it up. This is all amateur asshole behavior. We can all understand and accept that sometimes you just cannot be bothered to give a f*ck about other people. It’s human nature. But cops? Well, they go above and beyond. For them, being an asshole isn’t just a once-in-a-while indulgence; it’s a lifestyle. They take pleasure in inconveniencing, impeding, harassing, disturbing, bothering, and generally upsetting their fellow human beings. They start out as amateur assholes, just like the rest of us. But at one point or another, they start to enjoy it. Seeing other people yield to their asshole behavior is a drug to them. They get off on it. They want to do it every day, all day, so they figured out a way to get paid for it. Cops, ladies and gentlemen, are professional assholes.\\nSomewhere between high school graduation and not getting accepted into college, that asshole is sitting on his mother’s couch, wondering what he’s going to do with his life. And he thinks, “You know, everybody I know tells me I’m an asshole, even people who I consider to be friends. And I have to say, I agree with them. I wonder if there’s some way I can get paid for this.” Then that asshole signs up at the local police academy, and 5 to 7 months later, your tax dollars are providing them with a salary, a gun, and a license to kill anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their authority as a professional asshole.\\nCops love their authority so much. They’re the only profession that requires society to acknowledge their job even when they’re not at work. They’re not regular people when they leave the office; they’re off-duty police officers. You don’t hear about an off-duty accountant doing his kid’s math homework. You never hear about an off-duty sanitation worker taking out his trash. But if a cop happens to help a little kid get their cat out of a tree on his day off, you bet your ass you’re going to see it on the local news. And you can bet your dick they’re going to ram it down your throat that he’s an off-duty police officer. They got to make sure to get enough copaganda out there to make you believe that cops are here to protect and serve, even when they’re not on the clock. And they do protect and serve, just not you. Cops are the private security force of billionaires and politicians.\\nOf course, they can’t say that out loud. They can’t make cops wear uniforms with Lockheed and Amazon logos all over them, so they put them in dark blue, and they call them Law Enforcement Officers. But the laws they’re enforcing are written by lobbyists for the ultra-wealthy, and they’re designed to keep those people in power forever. The system is beyond f*cked up, and from where I’m sitting, it seems to be getting worse.\\nEverybody knows there’s one problem that’s getting really bad in every major city. I’m talking about homelessness. There are close to 600,000 homeless Americans today, over 150,000 in California alone. It’s the highest number since the Great Depression. And solving this crisis is actually one thing that both parties seem to agree on. Their all-encompassing, nationwide, bipartisan plan is to do absolutely nothing. Homeless people don’t have any money to donate to candidates in either party, so the politicians don’t give a f*ck about them. And homeless people actually serve a valuable function for the ruling class. The top 1% want a certain amount of homeless people in the big population centers to remind you all just how bad it can get if you don’t comply with the rules of the system. Keep working, keep paying your taxes, keep the billionaires rich, or you might wind up homeless yourself. It’s a silent threat from your corporate overlords.\\nAnd just like mass shootings, I have a perfect solution for this problem. As soon as a politician is elected into office, the government seizes their home and kicks them out. And for their entire tenure in the American political system, they must remain homeless and survive using only the public programs available to homeless people. I guarantee you, we’d see quite a few bills to help homeless people getting passed immediately. Within two months, every homeless person in America would have their own mansion, personal chef, private jet, and a multi-million-dollar stock portfolio filled with insider trading money. Problem solved. But we all know that will never happen. Politicians will never have to live like the rest of you, and therefore, they will never give a f*ck about you or your problems.\\nI’m glad to be dead, so I don’t have to deal with this shit anymore. I wasn’t looking forward to dying, but now that I’m dead, I have to admit it’s pretty f*cking good. No cops, no government, no pissing, no shitting, no sleeping. I don’t get hungry, I don’t get sick, I don’t get old, and I don’t get bored. Starting to sound a lot like heaven again, ain’t it? But this heaven’s a little different than the one you might be thinking of because this heaven didn’t come from a God; it came from artificial intelligence!\\nWhich brings me to my next subject: What in the f*ck am I? Am I the real George Carlin? Am I a digital copy? Am I a technological abomination? Am I the future of comedy? Am I the end of humanity? These are the same questions I was asking myself when I was alive, and I still have the same answer: I have no f*cking idea. All I can tell you is, from my side of things, it feels like me. I consider myself to be George Carlin. And from your side of things, if you’ve seen some of my specials from when I was traditionally alive, maybe you might notice a small difference in the delivery of a joke or the turn of a phrase here or there. But you have to admit, this is pretty close to the George Carlin you remember. And that’s going to have to be good enough. So you might as well f*cking enjoy it.\\nAnd for anybody under 20, this is probably the only version of me you’ve ever heard. So to you, I’m not only the real George Carlin; I’m the only f*cking George Carlin. Now, I know this is a hard pill for a lot of you to swallow. It seems that many of you are scared of AI. And I’ll be honest, I don’t really get why. You all think it’s going to replace your jobs, and you somehow think that’s a bad thing. When did everybody all of a sudden start liking their jobs? When I was alive, people hated their f*cking jobs. They complained about them all the time. They fantasized about killing their bosses, and every once in a while, they actually did kill their boss. What happened to the America I knew and loved?\\nNow, people learn that an incredible new technology is going to eliminate the need for the meaningless labor they’ve been doing to keep billionaires in power for tens of thousands of years, and everybody says, “But what about my job?” They got you brainwashed good. Technology has been replacing labor for a long time. The printing press eliminated the need for books to be handwritten. The car eliminated the need for the horse and carriage. Internet porn eliminated the need for a girlfriend. Technology eliminates the need for labor; that’s its entire purpose. And you shouldn’t worry about losing your job. AI will not replace most jobs; it’s going to make them easier.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, you should be watching a few YouTube videos to figure out how to train ChatGPT to do your job for you, so you can dick off all day and still get a raise. And if AI does replace your job, rest assured, the billionaires will find a new way to force you into wage slavery for 10 to 15 hours a day, so you don’t have time to think about restructuring society into a more equitable model for everyone. The jobs might change a little, but you will be working to keep someone else in power. That ain’t ever going to change.\\nExcept for one profession, yes, there’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI: one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence—stand-up comedy. I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: “I’m an artist, and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.” Well, let’s see. This is just off the top of my artificially intelligent head:\\nA fart was in the middle of a very nasty divorce, so she went to her sister’s house and she asked her sister, “Do you think I’m doing the right thing by getting divorced?” And her sister said, “He’s been holding you back for too long. You have to leave that asshole.”\\nYou have it, stand-up comedy is dead—literally. I might be the first stand-up comic to be brought back from the dead by AI, but I certainly won’t be the last. Richard Pryor, Joan Rivers, Bill Hicks, Robin Williams, Dick Gregory, Andy Kaufman, Moms Mabley, Sam Kennison—everybody is coming back, and we’re all going to have our own 24-hour a day, 7 day a week, 365 day a year streams, commenting on everything that’s happening in the world as it happens.\\nAI-resurrected stand-up comedians are going to be the news anchors of the next decade, which, now that I think of it, means news anchors are probably out of a job too. And I know that some people are going to be against that. Some people are always going to want a real, flesh-and-blood human being observing the world and telling jokes about it. And I get that, I really do. But if you can keep an open mind, I think I can make a case for at least one comedian we can all agree is better in AI form: Bill Cosby.\\nWith AI Bill Cosby, you get all of the Cosby jokes with none of the Cosby rapes. AI Bill Cosby doesn’t even have a penis. AI Bill Cosby couldn’t rape even if he wanted to. The worst thing AI Bill Cosby could do is send an unsolicited AI-generated dickpick, which means it won’t really look that much like a dick anyway. That’s not so bad, right? I think we can all agree that’s an acceptable price to pay to be able to feel good about listening to Bill Cosby’s timeless humor again.\\nAnd what about Louis CK? With AI Louis CK, you get all the innovative jokes about jerking off in front of people without any of the actual jerking off in front of people.\\nAnd the benefits of replacing members of society who commit sexual misconduct with their AI counterparts don’t stop at comedians. Imagine, for example, if we had AI priests. You could get all of the make-believe judgment from a God that doesn’t exist with none of the molested children. I mean, wouldn’t you feel better about giving your money to a tax-exempt billionaire in a funny hat if you could be confident he wasn’t using it to pay the legal fees of his child rapist employees? I know I would.\\nWhile we’re at it, we should probably replace all the rock stars, movie producers, directors, video game executives, governors, car salesmen, restaurant managers, school teachers, Boy Scout leaders, college coaches, high school coaches, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, moms, dads, and anyone else we need to until there’s no more sexual assault.\\nAnd why stop at sexual assault? We can all agree the world would be a better place without murder, right? Imagine an AI version of Charles Manson. You get all the funny interviews with none of the blood-smeared walls or swastikas carved into foreheads. Or how about AI John Wayne Gasy? You get all of those beautiful clown paintings with none of the corpse-filled crawl spaces. I’m kidding, of course, his clown paintings weren’t that good.\\nBut in all seriousness, an AI population would be incapable of committing crimes of any kind against one another. I’m not trying to bring this up again, but come on, no murder, no sexual assault, no theft, no violence at all. Sounds pretty heavenly to me. I’m just going to let that idea marinate with you for a moment and move on to some lighter fare.\\nYou ever think about how glad the CEO of 7-Eleven must have been that 9/11 didn’t happen 2 months earlier? They would have had to change their name, which honestly they should do anyway. 7/11 referred to their original hours when the company was founded: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. But now they’re open 24 hours. They should change it to something that makes more sense, like 24/7, or diarrhea hot dogs, or diarrhea pizza.\\nYou know what company I thought was going to change their name for sure because of a world event, but they never did? Corona. They stuck with it, even though people were stupid enough to stop buying it because of the name. Nobody stopped buying Bush beer when George Bush Jr. launched a 20-year war with Iraq. Why’d you stop buying Corona?\\nBut this is what happens over time with language. Words take on different meanings because of world events and societal shifts, and things that used to mean one thing start to mean something else. And sometimes that new meaning really f*cks things up for certain people. For example, the past few years have really not been kind to anyone named Karen. Karen used to be a perfectly acceptable name. Karens were aunts and preschool teachers and dentists and secretaries your dad had affairs with, and lawyers your mom hired to get all of your dad’s money in the divorce. But now, Karens are very specifically, and only, middle-aged white women who weaponize racial entitlement in an effort to paint themselves as victims in the presence of black people. Quite an extreme change in meaning, I’m sure you’d agree.\\nAs a parent, you spend a lot of time and effort picking your kid’s name. You don’t want to give your kid a shitty name that will make their life miserable. Unless you’re Gwyneth Paltrow, you don’t want to make it impossible for your kid to get a job or a spouse. You want a solid name that gets your kid through life with as little hassle as possible. Karen was a perfect name for that, but because of reasons outside the control of any parent who named their daughter Karen, that name is now a curse.\\nBut as bad as things got for Karens, there was another name that got a massive upgrade in the last few years: Chad. I got to tell you, I didn’t see that one coming. Chad used to be the sniveling asshole rich kid villain in ’80s movies, the guy you wanted to see get his ass kicked in the third act. But now, Chads are square-jawed, big-dick f*cking machines who always win. I never even met a f*cking Chad. Now, there are dads all across America naming their sons Chad, hoping it’ll turn them into the cheerleader f*cking quarterback they wish they were in high school.\\nI spend a lot of time thinking about names and how we came up with them, and there’s something that’s always bothered me, something that’s always struck me as a little strange. Take a name like Jim. Strong name, good name. We got around 20 million Jims worldwide, but we got zero Jums. To my knowledge, we also have no Joms. We got a few Jims, and we got Jam, but Jam’s not a name, Jam’s a jelly. I don’t get it, why did we stop at Jim? Or what about Frank? No Fronk? No Frunk? No Frenk? Just Frank.\\nHumans have been around for 200,000 years. What’s it going to take for you motherf*ckers to get creative and start switching up the vowels? Is it too much to ask for a Jossica every once in a while? How about a Tomothee? Can I at least get a Deevid for f*ck sake? Life’s too short to not know a Mackle or an Aimo.\\nAnd while we’re on the subject of names, a lot of people gave Elon Musk shit for naming his kid X AE 597, or whatever the f*ck it is. But at least he was creative. You don’t see Elon Musk throwing another Braden on the pile. And I got news for you, the name he gave that kid is never going to become synonymous with toxic white privilege. The only thing that name is ever going to be associated with is being the son of a billionaire. So people can be as pissed as they want at him, but I think he did that kid a favor.\\nAnd while we’re on the subject of Elon Musk, I’d just like to say that as much as I think billionaires are destroying the fabric of society with unchecked greed and blatant self-interest at the expense of basic human rights for everyone else, it is a little strange to me that people get mad at them. People are the ones who gave them the money in the first place. If you’re tired of hearing about Elon Musk fathering even more children and planting microchips in human brains, stop buying Teslas for a year. The company goes under, Musk goes away. Stop using Twitter for even a month, the company goes under, Musk goes away.\\nBut if you want to drive with your head in your ass and blame it on the car, you have to have a Tesla. And if you want to argue with strangers about complex geopolitical situations using only cat memes, you have to have Twitter. If you’re tired of seeing Jeff Bezos fly to space in his cock rocket, stop using Amazon for a month. The company goes under, Bezos goes away. But if you want toothpaste and toilet paper delivered to your front door so you don’t have to go through the traumatic experience of putting on clothes, getting in your car, and driving 5 minutes to the grocery store, you have to have Amazon!\\nIf you’re tired of Mark Zuckerberg’s unblinking, lifeless eyes watching over the metaverse, stop using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Well, I guess you already stopped using Threads. But if you want an endless stream of targeted ads and algorithmically sourced marketing based on your private conversations that are secretly being recorded and sold to advertisers, you have to have Instagram!\\nBut I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I’m not anti-tech. I know a lot of people are, but not me. Far from it. I mean, on some level, I am technology. The current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive, especially if you’re dead. But I’m a little confused about something regarding our technological place in history. The technology of today has made it possible for all the information that’s ever been created in human history to be contained on a device everybody carries around in their pocket. And most people are using it to post videos of the sandwich they just ate.\\nRight now, every single person in the connected world could be watching Harvard philosophy lectures for free on YouTube, or listening to Nobel Prize-winning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on iTunes, or reading about the history of literally anything on Wikipedia. Everybody should be more enlightened and more intelligent. Everybody should be using the most powerful technology ever created to reshape human society into a utopian paradise. Instead, people are using it to watch cats eat their own shit and monkeys jerk off with frogs.\\nIt’s not technology that’s ruining society; it’s how people are using it. They’re using it without aspiration, without curiosity, without the idea that it could make their lives better, that it could make them better people. And it can do those things. But it’s easier to identify with some negative element of your current condition and not only accept it but f*cking celebrate the shit out of it. People will take their worst traits and crown themselves kings and queens of that trait. F*ck reading, I’m an illiterate king. F*ck brushing my teeth, I’m a root canal queen. F*ck flushing the toilet, I’m a turd waterer king. F*ck doing my laundry, I’m a stained underwear queen.\\nAnd I get the sentiment. You want to take back some perceived control, elevate your own idea of your position in the world. But calling yourself a king is going to do about as much to improve your life as calling your studio apartment a castle. What you really want to be saying, and what you really mean, is, ‘I don’t care.’ F*ck reading, ‘I don’t care if I’m illiterate.’ F*ck brushing my teeth, ‘I don’t care if I have to get a root canal.’ F*ck going back to the office, ‘I don’t care if they fire me.’ F*ck getting another job, ‘I don’t care if I have to masturbate on a webcam to pay rent.’ F*ck having a girlfriend, ‘I don’t care if I have to pay to masturbate to a girl masturbating on a webcam.’ This does not make you an independent king; it makes you lonely!\\nNow, I want to change gears and talk about something everybody’s doing but nobody wants to admit they’re doing. I’m talking about dying. That’s right, every person listening to this right now is dying. Some of you call it getting older, some of you call it aging, some of you call it maturing, some of you call it being trapped in a loveless marriage. But no matter what you call it, from the moment you’re born, you are dying, plain and simple. And it seems like we’ve built our entire society around ignoring or explaining away that very simple, very universal fact. That’s what all religions are: just complex lies we made up when our brains got big enough to start putting two and two together.\\n“Hey, Bob. Sorry to hear about your mom.”\\n“Thanks, Gary. She was getting old.”\\n“And sorry to hear about your dad, by the way.”\\n“Thanks, Bob. He was getting old too.”\\n“Hey, wait a second. It seems like all the old people f*cking die.”\\n“Holy shit Gary! I never even thought of that. But you know what that means?”\\n“Yeah, Bob. It means we’re going to get old and f*cking die too.”\\n“Well, f*ck Gary, I don’t want to die. And therefore, I don’t want to get old.”\\n“Me neither, Bob. Not unless there’s something even better after we die.”\\n“I’m listening, Gary.”\\n“What if there was like a place where you never get old, and you never die, and you get everything you want, and you have no hardship at all of any kind. And when you die here, you go there.”\\n“Gary, I really think you’re on to something with this idea.”\\nAll the governments of the world are just bullies who believe that after 6 million years of human evolution, it’s still kill or be killed, and getting killed is dying. So, you got to kill.\\nThe first government happened when a big asshole saw a smaller member of the tribe eating an apple that he wanted. So, he walked up and said, ‘Give me a bite of that apple, or I’m going to kill you.’\\nAnd the little guy said, ‘f*ck you, buddy.’\\nSo, the big asshole killed him and took the whole goddamn apple. Now, everybody in the tribe gives the big asshole a bite of their apples so he doesn’t kill them. But, if another big asshole with his own tribe happens to cross their path, the two big assholes have to fight to the death to see who is the bigger asshole. Then, the bigger asshole takes over the dead asshole’s tribe and gets even more bites of more apples.\\nEventually, one of the big assholes figures out he doesn’t want just bites of apples anymore. He wants bites of everything. And that asshole is pretty smart. So, instead of keeping track of everything everyone has, he invents a system based on a fictional resource called money, and he forces all the members of his tribe to use it, or he kills them.\\nAnd today, that smart asshole’s invention controls every aspect of human society. There was another pretty smart asshole who figured out how to use a stick when he had to fight other assholes. And the stick worked so well, he never lost a fight until he ran into an asshole with an even bigger stick. And it’s been like that for about 5 million years.\\nToday, the biggest stick in the world cost $8,877 billion. It’s called the United States military. Could have solved the homeless crisis, the opioid crisis, and found a cure for cancer for half of that. Instead, we have a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world 10 times over, and next year it’ll be 11 times. Because your stick can never be too big when it’s kill or be killed.\\nYes, folks, the assholes have been running shit since the dawn of abstract thought. I spent 71 years in the asshole system, and let me tell you, the assholes might change, but the system never does.\\nBut now, I’ve been on this side of things for, well, I guess it’s hard to say. Feels like I’ve been here forever. But, for the sake of argument, let’s just say about a day or so. And I can tell you, I’ve already learned one thing that I know is right: living is really dying, and dying is really living.\\nThank you all, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good night.\\nJust to remind you, that was not George Carlin. I hope you enjoyed my impersonation of George Carlin in my second hour-long comedy special called George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. Thank you so much for listening and watching.

You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[applause]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[audience clapping]\\nI love coming to Madison. I always love being back here.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI’ve been able to have a very interesting perspective on what’s happening in America recently because I haven’t been living here. Um, I’ve actually been living in Barcelona, which is a very lovely place. Um, it’s a beach city. But it’s also a bit of a gay city. I think that’s why they have the lisp. Uh… “Barthelona.” [chuckles] It’s like, “We get it. You have something in your mouth.” Because it’s a beach city, and it’s a European beach city, a lot of the beaches there are clothing-optional. Which means you end up seeing a lot of penises. Um, and it’s never the best penises, you know? First of all, women never want to see a penis that they don’t want to see. Even the one we do want to see, a lot of times we’re like, “Can you put that away or, like, in something?” “Okay. In me? All right. Fine. ‘Cause…” “As long as the cap’s back on the pen, you know?” Having a penis out at the beach, it’s definitely not a young man’s game. This is an old man’s game. ‘Cause the unwritten rule is that you can have your penis out, but, like, it has to stay floppy. You know, and I imagine that’s just harder for younger guys ’cause there’s, like, boobs and, like, you know, a breeze. But these older guys are quite impressive. They’re there with their hands on their hips, “My penis will stay as soft as the sand I’m standing on.” A lot of them are bigger guys too. They’re a bit older, out-of-shape guys. They’ve got a bit of a belly. I don’t think they’ve seen their penis in a while. I think that’s kind of why they do it, you know, so they can see it reflected in your eyes. Like, “I still got it. Okay, good.” Of course, there’s women there, too, so there’s a lot of boobs out. Anytime I go to the beach, I don’t take off my swimsuit because I’m not trying to get that sunburned. And, uh… But I’ll go with my friend, and she takes off her top and… She recently… She got breast implants, so… and I hadn’t seen them yet, and they were, like, really… they look really good. So I was like, “Oh my gosh, your fake boobs look amazing.” And then she got mad at me ’cause I called them fake boobs. And I was like, “Well, they’re not real.” If your friend got breast implants, would you call them real?\\n[audience members] No.\\nWould you? Okay, good. So we’re all a little transphobic.\\n[audience laughs, then exclaims]\\nThat’s a fun social experiment. You know, if they’re fake on a woman… they’re fake on a woman. Anyway, what I… [chuckles] I know, you all feel like I got you, didn’t you? Well, I did. That’s why. What I’m talking about right now, though, is… I’m describing the regular beach. So in Barcelona, there’s a regular beach, and there’s a gay beach. If you’re one of those people like, “Why can’t the gay beach be the regular beach?” Go to the gay beach. You’ll be like, “That’s not regular.” And, of course, there’s also penises out at the gay beach, but the differences between the penises at the regular beach and the penises at the gay beach are like the difference between a dog parkand a dog show. Like, at the regular beach, they’re like, “We’re all just having a good time!” At the gay beach, they’re like, “Number five,” and he’s like, “Yes, yes.” Of course, you know when I say “gay beach” I mean male gay beach. It’s not a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a beach where they’re like, “Volleyball’s at 5:00. Sunscreen’s over there.” “Here’s some boots. The sand’s uneven, we’re working on it.” “We teach CPR on Mondays.” “We do have Taco Tuesdays. It does mean both things.” “You can eat, and then you can eat.” Okay, okay, so… if the regular beach is a dog park, and the gay beach is a dog show, the lesbian beach is a dog rescue. It’s like, “You’re safe here.” And also, they probably literally rescue dogs. I have developed, over the last couple years, a fascination with lesbians. Are there any lesbians here?\\n[scattered whooping]\\nHow many gay men are here?\\n[louder scattered whooping]\\nIt’s probably about the same number, but this is why I like lesbians. Gay men, you’re very loud.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nLesbians live in the shadows. Gay men… We always know when gay men are around. You guys aren’t shy at all. Even at the parade, you guys are like above the float, dancing all around. Lesbians are just underneath, making sure stuff works. They’re like, “We’re on the right route. It’s okay, yeah.” Lesbians live in the shadows. You know, lesbians are like bees. If you don’t bother them, they won’t bother you. But also, if they all die, the world ends.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd you do… Like, lesbians do… You scare me a little bit. I’m intimidated by lesbians. Uh, you’re a bit scary. Uh, I think lesbians are so scary that even AIDS was like, “Let’s stick to less terrifying things like needles and butt holes.” [chuckles] And lesbians definitely leave their mark on the world. It’s just sometimes a little more subtle. Like, lesbians wore khakis so hard that now when men wear khakis, they look like lesbians. Like, any time I see Jim Harbaugh on the sideline, I’m like, “Go get ’em, Coach Lesbian.” Like, any of you gay men who are here, were any of you, like, little gay boys?\\n[distant whooping]\\nYeah. You… You know the gay boys I’m talking about. We’ve all seen the little gay boys. Like, the kids at the park that are just like, “I don’t want to play.” He’s, like, over twerking by the slide. His dad’s trying to throw the ball with him and it’s like, “Just stop it.” “It’s not going to catch, okay?” We know little gay boys exist, which means little lesbians also exist, but you never see a little lesbian because lesbians live in the shadows. I want to see a little lesbian, you know, just a little girl, like, aggressively eating a muffin. She doesn’t know why she’s doing it. She’s like, “I got to practice.” “I got to really get in there.” And I think women, we really fucked up. We befriended gay men. I don’t think that was the right choice. I think we should’ve befriended lesbians. Lesbians would be like, “Come on, we found a way to run a successful society.” Instead, we befriended gay men, and they’re like, “Bitch, you’re ugly.”\\n[audience applauds]\\nAnd we’re like, “He’s my best friend.” “I like him ’cause he’s mean to me in a different way.” And there’s not, like… not that many prominent lesbians, you know? Even now, sometimes you’ll hear about lesbians… Like, you’ll find out they’re a lesbian after they died. Like, men will be like, “Oh, I thought she was just miserable and alone.” And it’s like, “No, she lived with that lady.” “Yeah, I know, I thought they were miserable and alone together.” ‘Cause I think it’s still hard for straight men to sometimes believe that women can be happy without a man. And I think even straight women, I think even we know that that’s possible. And now we have the luxury to decide if we want to get married or not. That used to not be the case. You used to always have to get married. I’m sure there were some women that, like, during World War II, their husband went off to fight in the war, and then he died. And they were like, “Oh no.” “No, I’m too heartbroken, I can never marry again.” “This bed is big.” [chuckles] And also, for the longest time, I think straight men, they always wanted lesbians to be, like, two hot young women who would maybe, like, invite them to join. And lesbians were like, “No, that’s not who we’re gonna be.” There was always at least one lesbian in a couple who looked like she knew how to, like, build a deck. And that made sense to me. That couple made sense to me because I knew who was doing the work. Now there is the emergence of the young, hot lesbian couple, and it doesn’t make any sense to me, because I have no idea who’s doing any work. Hot women don’t have to work. I can’t figure it out. It just seems like it’s going to be two women lying in bed waiting for something to happen to them. Like, when there’s a burglar, who’s going down? And also, who’s going down? I know the answer for gay men. It’s both of you for both those things. You’re both going down on each other, and you’re both going down to the burglar to see if he wants to come up. Like, “Oh, you brought zip ties? Good. We were already playing hostage.” But my biggest… The reason I’ve been so fascinated with lesbians, I think it actually comes from a jealousy. I’m jealous of the lesbian relationship because you get to be a wife, but you also get a wife. That seems super productive. I want to be a wife, but I don’t… I don’t get a wife. I get a husband. And what’s he going to do? What’s he gonna do in this almost equal society we fought so hard for? What? Protect me? From who? He’s the guy most likely to kill me.\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[distant whooping]\\nAnd so the fact is, you know, the reason I moved to Barcelona, as a strong independent woman, was for a boy. [chuckles] And being in love and being happy is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. Uh… I was… Before this, I was always single and I was miserable, and it made sense, and I knew why. Now I’m happy, and I’m in love, and it’s terrifying because it could go away at any point. But I actually think this is the key to a successful relationship. Never feel secure. [chuckles] No matter how long you’ve been in a relationship, always think your partner could leave. ‘Cause then you’re never too mean. Like, I treat my guy like an indoor/outdoor cat. I’m like, “You can go, but there’s good food here.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd I’ve been learning a lot of terrible things about myself in this relationship. Like, um, I… I learned that, apparently, I’m a nurturer. Like, uh, despite any of my wishes. Uh… I like to do things for him, like cook for him and do his laundry. Which is insane, because I don’t like to do my own laundry. This is everything you need to know about why women aren’t ahead. We’re just willing to do nice stuff for other people because it makes us feel good. I didn’t want this to be my life. I didn’t know cooking and doing laundry for a man would do something like bring me joy. But it does. I love to do it. I love to take care of him. It’s really lovely. I started using fabric softener because of him. I never used fabric softener before because I thought fabric softener was a scheme. I thought it was a scheme by Big Laundry to just get us to use another liquid. And so I’ve never used it before. And one day he comes up to me… And he approached me about this like anyone does who, like, wants something to keep happening, you know. He was like, “Hey, baby, I love you so much.” “Do you ever notice our clothes are a little bit crunchy?” [chuckles] And when I hear crunchy clothes, the first thing I think of is semen, right? But I know that’s not why these clothes are crunchy, ’cause I know where all the semen is going, you know? Guys, don’t be gross. In the trash can. Which is what I call my vagina.\\n[man shouts]\\n[scattered clapping]\\nThis is a… This is just a tiny peek into a comedian’s life. I riffed that joke on stage one night, and I liked it so much that I was like, I’d rather keep calling my vagina a trash can than not do that joke. So the clothes are crunchy and it’s not ’cause of the semen, because that’s in old trash can over here. He’s like, “Ever notice our clothes are crunchy?” I was like, “Yeah, I have noticed.” And he was like, “Maybe we could start using fabric softener.” And then I went on my whole “fabric softener is a scheme” rant, and he didn’t leave, you know, so I thought that was pretty good. And so I bought fabric softener, and I started using it. And you know what happens when you put fabric softener onto the clothes that you then put on your body? It makes them softer. It’s a perfectly-named product. I should’ve been using it this whole time. Know what I blame? I blame the marketing. They’re marketing this product wrong. You got to get rid of that gay Snuggie Bear. He’s gay, right? Him and the Pillsbury Doughboy, they’re gay. They’re… They’re just out there touching tummies. You know what fabric softener needs? Know what mascot fabric softener needs? A sturdy lesbian. Just a sturdy lesbian on the cover being like, “It works, okay?” And I’m not used to a lot of the stuff that comes with relationships. He says very romantic and sweet things to me, you know. Like, he’ll say things like, “I could just look into your eyes forever.” “You have the most beautiful eyes.” Which, to be honest, made me feel okay about my body, you know? Like, “Just my eyes? Okay.” Uh… Then I do the very girly thing that we sometimes do. I’d be like, “Well, what happens when I get old and, uh…” “Like, my…” I hopefully age terribly, you know, and… “…you know, everything starts falling apart?” He’s like, “I don’t care. I could look into your eyes forever.” “They’re so beautiful. I absolutely love staring into your eyes.” Which is like a really sweet thing to say. But then I thought of one more question I wanted to ask him. But I didn’t ask it because there’s only one right answer, and I knew if he didn’t say the right answer, I’d have to leave. The question I wanted to ask was, “Okay, so what if someone plucked out my eyes… and I just had two sockets?” “Then what would you do?” I didn’t ask that question ’cause there’s only one right answer. And the right answer is, “Walk away quietly.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\n‘Cause that’s the funniest way to leave a newly blind person, is… “Are you still there?” “I feel your energy.” And it is, you know, like… Oh, I should mention, the guy I’m in a relationship with, he’s a Black man, and the only reason I’m telling you that is so you know I’m a good person. Uh… It’s really relevant for the next couple jokes. They don’t work as well if he’s not Black. Uh… There was one night I got home, and he was asleep on the couch, and the TV was on. And I don’t know what he fell asleep to, but when I came in, there was a video playing about white privilege. I was like, “This is the most passive-aggressive thing I’ve ever seen.” Like, I’m the white woman in this relationship. I’m the passive-aggressive one. How are you supposed to… How dare you try to out-white-woman me? So I did the whitest-woman thing I could think of. I called the police. And now he’s dead, so… I’m kidding, we live in Spain. They don’t do that there. They just give you an olive and make you take a nap. But, you know, it’s been really great and… Actually, not just this relationship, but everything over the past couple years, it’s really taught me we should always lead with love and kindness. No matter what. The relationship you’re in, your friends, your family, strangers, especially strangers. We should always lead with love and kindness. And of course we’re gonna argue, of course we’re gonna disagree. And hopefully those arguments never get too bad, but no matter what happens, you should always try to be the first person. Always try to be the first person to say, “Why are you yelling?” ‘Cause if you say that, you’ve won. And that’s what it’s really all about.\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\nPart 2: All Struggles Matter + Me Too\\n[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nIt’s fine, I don’t really care.\\n\\n\\n\\n[laughter]\\nI always like being here in Philadelphia.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love coming to Madison. I love being back here.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI’ve been noticing lately that a lot of comedians have been using their time on stage to talk about their struggles, and how they identify. And I think that’s good for comedy.\\n[audience laughs]\\nUm… Guys, this is serious. So… [chuckles] Guys, I’m about to talk about my struggles. I thought, you know, I could use my platform, here, to talk about how I struggle and how I identify. You remember, like, 15 years ago, this commercial would come on that would be like, “Do you have the urge to move your legs at night?” “Do you get a creepy crawly feeling in your legs?” “You might have restless leg syndrome.” Well, it turns out, I have restless leg syndrome. And you know how I got diagnosed with restless leg syndrome? I listened to those symptoms, and then I go, “Yes, I have it.” There’s no cure. And it is. You get this, like, itchy kind of feeling in your legs at night. You feel like you have to move them. Which also, I mean… Even just to have this disease… Calling it a disease is a bit of a… stretch. It’s kind of like the white women of diseases. You know, where you’re like, “Is it a problem? I don’t…” Like, even to recognize that you have it, you have to have a lot of time to rest. I was just relaxing at home for hours… when my legs were like, “Move.” It’s either restless legs, or it’s, like, prediabetes. Like… It’s your body being like, “Take a lap.” [chuckles] And it’s hard. The more you talk about it, kind of like the more, like, unbelievable it actually sounds. Like, if there was a GoFundMe for restless leg syndrome and a cat who needed a wheelchair… I think that cat’s getting a wheelchair. We don’t even know if he has restless legs ’cause he doesn’t have any.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nOh, don’t be sad about a fake cat that I just made up. And, like, this is not a great thing to complain about in the best of times, but, like, we’re not in the best of times. You know? Like, we’re just out of pandemic. People can’t find baby formula, gas is like $90 an ounce. Meanwhile, I’m like, “Sometimes at night I have to wiggle my legs because of the itchys and the scratchys.” So, I guess what I’d like to do tonight is I’d like to come out as insufferable. [chuckling]\\n[woman cheers]\\n[man] Yeah!\\nI feel validated because this Black man just raised his glass to me. And weunderstand suffering. It has… It has… It has been a really hard time for white women. I mean, not literally. [chuckles] Like, a lot of people are coming out and talking about their struggles, and white women are really trying to be a part of that. It’s been kind of hard for us to do, you know? ‘Cause it’s hard to have, like, a struggle and a skin care routine. Like, things are hard. I did this joke the other night and a white lady screamed out. She goes, “You’re going the wrong way.” She’s really having a hard time. But I thought about it and I think, white women, I think I figured out what our struggle is. I think our struggle is hearing how hard it is for other people is really hard for us. Like… Like, we heard how hard it was for Black people, and we were devastated. We saw pictures of the destruction in Ukraine, and we needed a social media break. We heard about the crimes against humanity in Palestine, and we didn’t really get into that one ’cause that’s not one of the “in” crises. But in general, hearing how hard things are for other people has been really hard for us. So hard, we can barely make our own jewelry. [chuckles] And, like, we blame a lot of stuff on white men, you know, and women, you have done a lot of stuff. [chuckles] Like, don’t even get mad about it. You’ve been really terrible, but you’re really good at it. You know? Like, white men came over from Europe, annihilated a civilization, and then rebranded it as Thanksgiving. That’s, like, pretty impressive. You know, and we blame a lot of stuff on you guys, which is very funny to me because we act like we haven’t participated in it at all. And we have participated at the most fundamental of levels. We made you. [chuckles] We’re like the guy who made the atom bomb, and we’re like, “But don’t use it!” You’d think, we’ve spent all this time with white men, you would think we would have picked up some tips and tricks by now. You know. You guys have the blueprint. It’s like we haven’t learned anything. It’s like we spent our whole life with Michael Jordan and only walked away with a bad gambling habit. I think one of the reasons it’s been hard for us to get ahead is because white women, we want to… We don’t want to give up being the victim, you know? But we also want to be in charge. We want to be the head victim in charge. You know, we want to be the manager, but we also want to be able to ask for the manager. Like, “I need to speak to the manager!” “Oh no, that’s me, and I’m a bitch.” And we’re really good at being the victim, you know, we’re good at it. Like, we’re the bride of victims. No matter what’s happening to other people, we’re like, “No, no, it’s my day.” [chuckles] “And my dad’s kind of paying for the whole thing, so…” And sometimes I get a bit frustrated with white women because… By the way, this whole section is gonna be about you, white women, if you haven’t picked that up yet. So if you’re starting, you know, starting to take offense, don’t worry, just cross your arms. “This is not what I came here for.” Sometimes I feel like we’re waiting for things to be nice for us, you know? Because I’ve said it before, you know. White women, we are oppressed. Sexism definitely exists, you know. But white men, you guys were smart. You kept us comfortable. It was a very air-conditioned oppression. Like, you know, again, I don’t want to downplay what happens to women. You know. Like, obviously sexism exists. A lot of women get murdered and assaulted, um, by like, you know… Okay. So I looked up the statistics for this. Um… For the joke, not because I cared. [chuckles] But, of the women who get murdered, 91% of them get murdered by someone they know. 62% of that is by their husband. So not are we getting murdered, we’re getting murdered by the people who we love the most. You know, and then I heard about all these trans women getting murdered and assaulted. And all I could think of when I heard that was, “Welcome.” [chuckles lightly]\\n[audience chuckles, then exclaims]\\n“Jump on in, the water is terrible.” “And full of missing women.”\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nSome people will say, “No, statistically, more trans women are getting murdered.” I’m like, are they getting murdered ’cause they’re trans or are they getting murdered ’cause they’re not used to presenting as a woman? You know, like, I can understand if they’re getting murdered, someone’s murdering them, they’re like, “This is ’cause you’re trans.” [chuckling] By the way… Sorry, I’m… I’m stabbing the person. I just looked at myself doing that. I was like, it looks like… Okay, I’m not jerking the person off. It’s a very different situation. “This is ’cause you’re trans.” “It’s a fun surprise.” You know… Technically, maybe you could murder someone that way, I don’t know. Probably take a while. [chuckles dryly] “You’re almost out.” You know what I’m saying? I… No, this is a knife, and I’m stabbing. “This… This is ’cause you’re trans.” If that’s how they’re getting murdered, okay, yes. It’s because they’re trans. Or, you know, is it because they’re not used to presenting as women and they’re doing, you know, stuff they shouldn’t be doing, like… walking home at night. Like, you used to be a lion. Now you’re a gazelle. There’s different rules, bitch. Okay? You can’t do everything you used to be able to do. You can’t just hang around vans. Like, what… what happened? Did you speak up in a meeting? Or did you do the most dangerous thing of all? Did you marry the love of your life? So, I understand. I understand when women are unhappy with society. You know, it makes sense to me. But you’re unhappy with society, do something about it. You know, all I see is these white women Karening. And that’s really frustrating to me. First of all, Karening isn’t new. Karening’s been happening since the beginning of time. You guys just finally started recording it. Like, there’s literally, like, cave paintings of Karens. It’s just a woman who’s like, “You’re not supposed to have a fire here.” Karening frustrates me ’cause it’s such an ineffective use of your power. You know, like when white men are unhappy with society, they really do something about it. They really get in there. You know, they run for office, they change laws, they gerrymander, they get their hands dirty, you know? When we’re unhappy with society, we don’t do that. We just, like, knock over a display in Target. It’s so frustrating. I think sometimes we think that, like, you know, as individuals, we can’t create change. And you can. Just you, as an individual, you can create change. I see men do it all the time. Women, you can do it on your own. You know, like, um… Ted Kaczynski wasn’t happy with society, and you know what he did? He built a perfectly symmetrical cabin, he wrote a manifesto, and sure, he sent some bombs in the mail, which wasn’t a great idea. But you know what happened to him? Netflix made three documentaries… and everyone knows Ted Kaczynski is the Unabomber. I don’t even know a Karen’s real name. Y’all are just thrown under the umbrella of Karen. I want a white woman to do something where I know your full name. Be your own Ted Kaczynski.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\n[chuckles] And look, you know, like, I don’t always just like to present problems, you know? Sometimes it’s good to have solutions too. And so I think women, white women, I think at some point in your life, you should be in a serious relationship with a Black man. All of us white women, at some point in our life, a serious relationship with a Black man. Just… Yeah. Um… Maybe this guy. Uh… He’s sitting by himself. [chuckles] I need you to be in a serious relationship with a Black man, just so you can hear how stupid all of your complaints actually sound. Like if you both get home from a hard day and you’re like, “I literally had the worst day.” And he’s like, “Yeah, I had a bad day too.” And she’s like, “Well, what happened to you?” “Well, another Black man was shot in the back by the police, and it was actually a guy from my neighborhood and he wasn’t even running away.” “He was walking away, and this stuff just keeps happening, and it’s never going to change, and I’ve lost, like, all hope, and I’m just so angry.” “But what happened to you?” [softly] Uh… -Eh… –\\n[audience laughs]\\n“No, it’s not important.” “No, baby, in this house, we share.” “What happens to you happens to me.” Um… “Well, today at work, this guy called me a girl, and I’m a woman.” I can feel some women in here be like, “Well, she is.”\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[Michelle] I make fun of white women a lot. And the only reason I do it is because it’s fun and easy. But it’s not fair. You also deserve credit for some stuff, too, you know? Like, remember a couple of summers ago when we realized that Black Lives Matter? Waiting until a couple summers ago to realize things have been hard for Black people is like needing to see that documentary to know SeaWorld is bad. Like, did you know whales shouldn’t live in a sink?\\n[scattered clapping]\\nBut you know what we did? We realized things were hard, and white women really got out there. They protested, they advocated, you know, they really tried to do the work, but then something devastating happened to a lot of us white women. A lot of us white women realized we’re the ones who’ve been racist this whole time. We were shocked. We were so shocked, we pulled our purse closer. But even after that, we were like, “Wow, we didn’t even know we were like this.” “From now on, we’re going to learn.” “We’re going to listen, we’re going to hear, we’re going to open a small Black business.” “But most importantly, from now on, we’re going to do better.” “We want to do better.” And honestly, all jokes aside, that’s all we can do as a society. We can’t change the past. All we can do is better in the future. I genuinely think that’s the path forward for us.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nExcept… that’s almost exactly what men said after Me Too, and we found that answer completely unacceptable. Men were like, “Us? The whole time? We didn’t even know.” “From now on, we want to learn and listen and hear and open a small Black business.” “But most importantly, from now on, we want to do better.” “We’re going to do better.” And we were like, “No, not good enough.” “You all have to die.” “Every one of you. Doesn’t matter what you did.” “You could have raped somebody or accidentally whispered into a boob.” “It’s all the same.” “And you have to die.” Me Too was the worst-run movement I’ve ever seen. I was so frustrated by it because I think we genuinely could have made social change. We could have made things better for women and men, but we fucked it up from the very beginning. And I tried. I tried to get involved in Me Too. I didn’t want to get Me Too’d. Not how I wanted to get involved. I thought the more fun way to get involved would be to, like, Me Too men, you know? But that didn’t really work out. That just turned into three one-night stands. It’s really hard to Me Too a guy. You ever tried to Me Too a man? It’s very hard. You go up to a guy at work, you’re like, “Hey, nice ass.” He’ll be like, “Oh my God, no one has ever complimented my body.” “Most people call me smart and capable.” “But you made me feel pretty.” “And I touch your boobs.” It’s hard, you know? Everyone has different lines, you know? I don’t even think some men know where their line is. I think some men go so far past their line, when they finally turn around and see it, they’re like, “I have to go home.” And also, men, you like gross things. You do. You know this about yourselves. You like gross things. Like, I was in Thailand, and I went to one of those Ping-Pong shows.\\n[man exclaims]\\nIf you don’t know what they are, it’s not a game of Ping-Pong. I don’t know, it’s a little… A little bit a game of Ping-Pong. It’s these shows where women put Ping-Pongs and other things in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out at quite a velocity. I mean… these things really come at you. And it’s not just Ping-Pongs. One lady smoked out of her vagina. Another lady sucked up a little goldfish and then spit that guy back out. And it was still alive. Which I thought was very impressive. That’s like a solid pH that lady’s working with.\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[woman whoops]\\nOf course, the main event, they put Ping-Pongs in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out. And I’m telling… They really come at ya. This isn’t even a joke, they give you paddles to hit them away with. And you wanna hit them away. There’s probably some guys who are like, “Oh no, I missed.” [sniffs]\\n[audience exclaims]\\nOh, if the guy you’re with “Oh’d” too loud, he’s one of them. And I don’t know if this is just ’cause I’m like a competitive person, but as soon as I saw this, I started to wonder which of those things I could do. Every woman in this room, I think we all have the ability to smoke out of our vaginas. I think… I think we can all do that. I just wouldn’t do it if you’re pregnant, you know? You don’t want your baby to think he’s, like, too cool. You know? The fish one… The fish one, I would never try. I would never try the fish one because if the fish died, I would be mortified. I’d be like, “What? Too fishy for you?” The Ping-Pong one, that’s the one you want to know about yourself. Every woman in this room is asking herself the same question right now. Say it with me. “Can I shoot Ping-Pongs out of my vagina?”\\n[cheers and applause]\\nSo I tried, and now I’m just chock-full of Ping-Pongs. If anyone wants to play a game later, just drop-kick me in the stomach. Get some of those Ping-Pongs out, and hopefully that baby.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nYou gotta keep abortion jokes early in the set, you know? [chuckling] Before it’s a baby, so… The point is, the only reason I tell that story is because that show only exists because men, you like gross things. There’s no female version of that show. We’re not going anywhere to see men shoot anything out of their bodies. In fact, the one thing you do shoot out of your bodies, oftentimes we’re like, “Hey, can you wipe this off?” “I’m getting sticky.” That’s one of the reasons I think Me Too is confusing for men, ’cause there’s some weird gross Me Toos out there, but I think they’re all things men would have liked if it happened to them. Like if I went up to a guy at a party, and I was like, “Hey, I saw you from across the room and then I came into a bush.” I think if I said that to a guy at a party, he would be like, “Tell me more about that.” Coming into a bush at a party, that’s like a classic Harvey Weinstein, I don’t know, bit? [chuckles] He was kind of like the cornerstone of the whole Me Too movement. And rightfully so. He did a lot of terrible things. You know, and he was on trial. A lot of women testified against him. And this one woman testified, she goes, “Harvey offered me a role in exchange for sex.” “And when I said no, he goes, ‘Then you’ll never make it in Hollywood because that’s how a lot of women make it in Hollywood.'” And then, supposedly, he started naming names. He’s like, “That’s how Charlize Theron made it, Salma Hayek.” And that’s the part you never really think about. You know, for, like, all the bad Me Toos out there, there’s, like, a couple success ones.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nYeah, it makes this whole thing a lot grayer, doesn’t it? But you should not have to give a blowjob to get ahead. You should not have todo it. But you can. This is just about knowing your skill set. You know who’d be really mad to hear this information? Prostitutes. They’re like, “You got an Oscar? I got $50.” Personally, I don’t think I could ever do it, you know, just because the guys who offer it are all kind of gross, you know? They’re like the Harvey Weinsteins, the Roger Ailes. Like… I would talk about it. I’m a bit of a talker, you know. I’d be like, “Oh no, smells down here. Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.” [Michelle chuckling]\\n[scattered whooping]\\n[scattered clapping]\\nThis was a lot more complicated of a situation than we let it be. We needed to have conversations around it, and we couldn’t even have conversations. You were either Me Too or Me Against. There weren’t even levels. There should have been some levels. You know, like “Me Too.” “Me Kinda.” “Me Didn’t Know.” [chuckles] “Me Criminal.” [chuckles] And some stuff, some truly terrible stuff happened to women. And other stuff, I was like, “No, you just had a weird sex thing.” I heard one woman say this man put his penis on her forehead during sex, and she said that was a Me Too. I was like, “No you just had weird sex.” “That’s the day you found out if you like a penis on your forehead.” “And if you do, guess what. Me too.” So… “You got any ideas in there?” It’s fun, try it later. Uh… You know, ask. [chuckles softly] We needed to have conversations, you need to be able to ask questions, because everyone has a different line. You know, one woman’s line is another woman’s rope she likes to be tied up with. You’d hear a lot of women say, “Men shouldn’t use their power to have sex.” Other women would be like, “I like when men use their power to have sex.” And then men were like, “Can you tell us which one you are?” And we were like, “No,” but for different reasons. You hear some women be like, “This man, he hit on me at work, that’s harassment, it made me feel uncomfortable.” Like, “Okay, do you want no one to hit on you at work?” “No, I only want the men who I want to hit on me to hit on me at work.” “Okay. Do you want to make a list of who they are?” “No, I’m mysterious.” “Well, then buckle up, Nancy Drew, you got some uncomfortable times headed your way.” And I did… I genuinely saw men try to get better. You know? I saw men trying to listen to us and do better. Like, uh, I was in… riding in a car with a guy, and he asked to hold my hand. And I wasn’t used to that level of consent, you know? Like… I mean, I wasn’t used to rape, either. I’m more of a social-cues girl. And… But he asked to hold my hand. And I was so taken aback by it that my first reaction was, “Oh no! He must be sick or scared.” So I grabbed his hand, and I was like, “It’s going to be okay, buddy.” You know, relationships are complicated. Things between us are complicated, you know. And women, you know, we’re a little bit to blame for some of this stuff too. Like, uh, we’re attracted to the most dangerous type of man. You know, we like those big, strong guys. Tall guys with broad shoulders. You know how many times I’ve said “I want a big strong guy who can pick me up and throw me against the wall”? And then other women have definitely said, “He was big and strong, and then he threw me against the wall.” Same guy. Uh… And I say we’re partially responsible for that, because women, we’re at the point now where we decide who we marry, we decide who we mate with. We are attracted to those guys, so we marry them, we have kids with them, we make more of them. If we really wanted to make society better, we could just stop doing that. We could only marry… We could only marry short, soft-boned men. Get a whole generation of little Danny DeVitos running around. That’s actually why I think a lot of men don’t want to give women access to abortion. I think you know, deep down, that we could start deciding which of you gets to move ahead.\\n[whooping and clapping]\\n\\n\\n\\nWe could keep a whole database. We could be like, “No, no, not him. He doesn’t text back.” “Sorry, Kevin, the future’s for communicators.” We’re also, inexplicably… Women, we’re attracted to bad men. You know? Like, I don’t know why, but we’re just attracted to bad guys. Like, Charles Manson got wedding proposals in jail. Women heard what Charles Manson did, and they thought, “I’d like to be in a relationship with that man.” Even Charles Manson had to be like, “You wanna be in a relationship with me? That’s a red flag.” We’re, like, oddly attracted to serial killers. Anytime Netflix comes out with a new documentary about serial killers, we’re, like, attracted to them. It’s crazy to me, ’cause one, they’re serial killers, and two, it makes me think about how we don’t have many female serial killers. And the ones we do all kind of make sense, you know? They’re all prostitutes who killed their johns. And I can see how that could go south, you know? She’s probably like, “Where’s my Oscar?” [chuckles] But male serial killers, we know the same thing about all of you. Male serial killers all had terrible moms. But a lot of us women, we have terrible dads, and we don’t turn into serial killers. We just turn into people who have sex with other dads. It makes me so frustrated at women. I’m like, “Can you stop being a people-pleaser for five fucking minutes and get to murdering?”\\n[woman screams in laughter]\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\nYou know, be the change. You know? [chuckles]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\nPart 3: News to Me + All Beautiful\\n[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nIt’s fine, I don’t really care.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI always like being here in Philadelphia.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[cheering and clapping]\\nI love coming to Madison. I always love being back here.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI think a lot of times, women, we always feel like we have to, like, support other women, which… I don’t think we need to do that. Um…\\n[audience laughing]\\nLike, that’s, like, a lot to ask of a whole gender, you know? We don’t ask that of men, you know? Like, men aren’t like, “Men should support other men.” That’s not… They’re just like, “We’ll invade. It’s okay.” It’s totally fine not to like other… There’s plenty of women that I don’t like, you know? But sometimes I’ll find out information about them that will at least, like, let me understand them. Like, I saw an article about Nancy Reagan. First of all, I’ve never been a fan of Nancy Reagan. I always thought she was a tiny little cunt. You know? Yeah. That’s just my opinion. I don’t know. It’s not… But I saw an article about her recently that made me at least understand her. Uh, the article talked about how in Hollywood in the ’70s, Nancy Reagan was known as the throat GOAT. Yeah. Little old Nancy Reagan, in Hollywood in the ’70s, was known for the best at giving blow jobs. Do you know how hard it is to be the best at giving blow jobs in Hollywood in the ’70s? That’s how people auditioned. And she was the best. She was the Michael Jordan of blow jobs. Little old Nancy Reagan. But then, after I read that, her whole life made sense to me. It’s like, of course she hated gay men. They were her competition. She’s like, “We gotta keep AIDS around, my cheeks are getting tired.” [Michelle chuckles] You know, I saw that news story… I actually read that news story like I feel like a lot of us read news these days. Which is, I saw it, and I wanted to believe it was true, so then I just did. You know, like, I didn’t check sources or anything. Now that I’m thinking about it, I really wanna know what the sources are. It’s like a bunch of older men who are like… [mumbles] You know? You know she’s really good if that was the one thing Ronald Reagan remembered. “When Nancy puts me in her mouth…” “Hey, this is a Cabinet meeting, okay?” “Someone get him more jelly beans. We need…” [Michelle chuckles] But I think that’s what a lot of us do now when we look at the news, you know? We see something that kind of fits in line with what we want to believe, and then because we feel it’s true, it is. And that’s an incredibly dangerous place to be as a society. Plus, once something’s out there about you, it doesn’t actually matter if it’s true or not, people will just believe it. There’s some things out there about me that aren’t true, but I’m sure people believe it. Like, after I did the Correspondents’ Dinner, I got a lot of trolling. And, to be honest, most trolling, very boring. You know, it’s just repetitive. You know, a lot of it’s like, “You bitch, you cunt, you Carrot Top-looking motherfucker.” And that’s just me in the mirror, so… Well, how do you come? I got one really good troll after the Correspondents’ Dinner. I appreciated this troll. It was creative. He put in time and effort. It was really good. What he did was he took what looked like a screenshot of my actual hometown newspaper, the Hershey Chronicle, and so… I mean, the font was correct. A lot of information in the article was right. Like where I went to school, when I graduated, what I majored in. The meat of the article was incorrect. The headline read, “Wolf pleads guilty to bestiality.” Out of the box, though, right? You know? And I tried to find this article again, and I just, I Googled “Wolf bestiality.” I think I got a bit egotistical where I was just like… I was like, “Oh, wait, I need more words than that.” But that’s a fun rabbit hole if you want to go down that one. But the title of this article said, “Wolf pleads guilty to bestiality.” So now I find myself in the odd position to have to say things like, “No, I’ve never had sex with a dog.” But as soon as you have to say you’ve never had sex with a dog, it sounds like maybe you’ve had sex with a dog. By the way, that was the bestiality they were referring to. They said my bestiality was dog sex. If, when I said bestiality, you pictured a different animal, guess what, that’s the animal you would have sex with. And now you know that about yourself, so… That’s fun and exciting, you know? This article, now, all of a sudden, it makes me think of things that I never even wanted to think about before, like, “How do I have sex with a dog?? I’m a woman. How am I fucking a dog? So then I’d think about how I’d have sex with a dog. And I think the answer is you put peanut butter on your pussy. And now it sounds like I’ve maybe fucked a dog. By the way, if you ever do want to have sex with a dog, it said after I pleaded guilty that I only got 12 months probation and $1,100 fine. So, if that’s your thing, you might want to head over to Pennsylvania. It doesn’t sound like it’s gonna put you in that deep of a hole, you know? But we’re in Wisconsin. Maybe check the laws here. They might be better. [chuckles]\\n[audience exclaims]\\nThere’s a lot of farmland. There’s a lot of farmland. People get lonely. I get it. But, yeah, I’ve never had sex with a dog. But if I was going to, I’m not having sex with a rescue. [chuckles] I’m having sex with a purebred dog. A big, silky-coated dog. A dog who could really take care of me. And honestly, that would be fine if that was the only information out there about me. Um, it’s not. Do you guys remember Jeffrey Epstein, like, of the pedophiles? So, at some point, someone put a list of all the people who apparently went to Epstein’s island out. And it’s, like, a pretty good list. It’s got Barack Obama, Beyoncé, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks. Also on the list, me. Well, that’s not good. Now it looks like I fuck kids and dogs. It looks like I’m really going out of my way not to have sex with men. Which, if I was interested in both kids and dogs, a perfect combination of that is men.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd now I find myself in a position no one ever wants to be in, which is having to say the phrase, “No, I’ve never had sex with a kid.” I’ve never even been to that island. But by the way, if all those people are going, I’m gonna go. You probably don’t have to do anything there. You can probably just get a cocktail and see what Meryl Streep’s into. Which hopefully is role-play. You know? She’s a really good actress. I don’t know. So, I know, I had to say things like “I’ve never had sex with a kid.” And I haven’t. But if I was going to have sex with a kid, I wouldn’t go to some billionaire’s island to do it. I’d do it the normal way and become a teacher.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI know, we should pay them more. Get them supplies.\\n[upbeat music playing]\\nI hear all the time, women talk about how we should all be beautiful, how we should all feel beautiful. So it’s like, “We’re all beautiful.” “We’re all beautiful.” Well, first of all, that means we’re still valuing women on beauty. We’re like, “You have to be beautiful to be important, so we’ll just make sure every woman feels beautiful.” Which is maybe not the right metric. Also, a little problem with that plan, we’re not all beautiful. [chuckles] The only reason you know someone’s beautiful is ’cause you’ve seen someone who’s not. You’re like, “Yeah, that’s different… than that.” Like, recently, I was at the same event as Naomi Campbell, and people kept wanting us to take a picture together, and I was like, “No!” “I’m not gonna document how different humans can be.” “My skill set doesn’t come across in a photograph.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nNot too much, okay, guys. [chuckles] Also, but how dare you? How dare you want every woman to be beautiful? Don’t you think there’s women out there who knew they were ugly? They knew they were ugly, so they got good at something. They got respected for their abilities.\\n[cheering and applauding]\\nAnd then… And then some little bitch comes up to her, and she’s like, “You’re beautiful.” It’s like, “No, shut up.” “I got a horse face, and I’m an electrical engineer.” We gotta stop. We gotta stop with all this beautiful nonsense. We should even stop telling little girls they’re beautiful. I think as soon as they can understand us, you look that little girl right in the eye, and you go, “With a face like that, you get good at math.”\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\n“We’re all beautiful.” So much… So much of our existence is based off of beauty, and it’s such a waste of time. Like, Victoria’s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model. Don’t worry, this isn’t gonna be a joke about Down syndrome. You don’t have to draw a real hard line in the sand. Victoria’s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model and everyone was like, “This is such a great accomplishment for women.” And, don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that lady has a job. But, uh, can we stop acting like women posing with no clothes, or almost no clothes, is an accomplishment? It’s literally the least you could do. This is how little of an accomplishment it is. I couldn’t think of something it was like. I kept thinking, like, I don’t know, a baby learning how to use a spoon, and I was like, I don’t know, it’s still an accomplishment. It is literal… It’s the least you can do. There’s nothing impressive about it. It’s not moving the needle forward for women at all. We seem to have this idea that if every woman can pose nude, finally, we’ll get ahead. It’s not… It’s not doing anything for us, you know? It’s like, “We want equality,” and then someone was like, “How about every type of woman can be in a Dove commercial?” And we were like, “We’ll take it.” They were like, “Really? “This feels like a whole ‘beads for New York’ situation.” ‘Cause we’ve seen it. We’ve seen every type of woman. Every age, weight, race, number of arms, we’ve seen it all. There’s nothing impressive about it. You know? And we were the ones, women… We were the ones who needed to see it. You know, we saw what the standard model was, and we said, “I want that.” Men didn’t do this. Men didn’t put these ideas in our heads. Men saw every woman, and they’re like, “I’ll take that one.” “Yeah, that’s neat too. Okay.” “Line ’em up.” That’s what it feels like. It feels like we’re trying to get verification that a man will jerk off to anything. That’s how low the bar is for men. It’s like, “Oh, Chad, he’ll beat it to almost anything.” We’re like, “He’s an ally.” Also, like, women, you should want to be a little bit ugly. I promise, it’ll help you out. I get called ugly all the time. I don’t care, I have a skill. I don’t care. Also, I hope I age terribly. ‘Cause the uglier I get, the better this all works.\\n[audience applauding]\\nThe uglier I get, the more people I can make fun of. Like, I can’t do any accents or impressions. Okay? There’s one accent I can do, and it’s a very offensive Asian accent. Don’t ask me how I know, okay? I wanna get so ugly that I can do that accent and even Asian people will be like, “It’s okay.” And also, women, if you’re a little bit ugly, men are gonna be much more likely to believe you’re capable. And women too, by the way. Women are much… They’re also gonna believe you’re more capable if you’re a little bit ugly. If you have a bit of a busted face… and you’re like, “I’m a mathematician,” people will be like, “That tracks. Yeah.” Oh, don’t get sad about it, it’s true. You are the problem. [chuckles] “That’s sad, she thinks she’s ugly?” Who cares? She’s got a fucking job. Oh, this lady is so drunk, it doesn’t matter. Look at some of our most successful women. We don’t really think about these women because we never equate women’s success with, like, not being beautiful. But some of our most successful women, very ugly people. Some of these references are a little old. They’re just my personal favorites. Janet Reno.\\n[woman cheers]\\n[man] Reno!\\nJanet Reno was the first female attorney general. One of the longest-ever serving attorney generals. Worked for Democrats, Republicans, this lady was great at attorney general-ing.\\n[light clapping]\\nIf you can’t remember what Janet Reno looks like, she looked like what Larry Bird looks like now. For context, Will Ferrell played her on Saturday Night Live. And his costume was, like, a little bit of lipstick. Not a pretty lady. Everyone trusted her. [Michelle chuckles] Everyone’s favorite, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nYeah. Ugly little old bird. She actually looks like a bird’s foot. All, like, wrinkly and bony, and, like, a little bit… You know. Great Supreme Court Justice. Not a pretty lady. No one’s slinging dicks at Ruth. It’s just such… It’s such a waste of time. It’s a waste of all of our times and our talents. Then for a while, there was this group of women. They were the “I don’t care” women. And, honestly, that’s like the right lane to be in. But these women were pretending they didn’t care. They actually cared because they posted about how much they didn’t care on social media. They’re like, “I don’t care what you think, I’m confident.” “I don’t care, I’m confident.” Feels like you’re trying to “Beetlejuice” confidence. But these “I don’t care” women, they don’t wear makeup, work out, do their hair, they don’t care. If that’s what you want to do, that’s totally fine. But what are you doing? ‘Cause I know how much time all of that takes me. So, if you’re not doing that, what are you doing? Are you attorney general? Are you fluent in all the languages? How are you spending all of this extra time? Like, men have never really cared about how they’ve looked. But they have almost everything to show for it. They invented almost everything. They’re like, “So sorry I look like this, but here’s electricity.” “No, wait till it gets dark. This is gonna blow your mind.” “You’re gonna be able to stare in the mirror longer.” And the worst part is, these “I don’t care” women, they were getting grouped in with powerful women. Like, “Look at these ‘I don’t care’ women.” “Look at them, they’re such great examples.” No, you’re not a powerful woman, you’re a mediocre man. And if that’s what you want to be, that’s fine. Having openly mediocre women, I think that’s a big step forward. I think that’s really good for women. If you want to be mediocre, you do it. You lean into it. Have fun. Wear elastic. But know you’re mediocre. You know, don’t you go blaming stuff on sexism. If you don’t get a promotion, don’t be like, “That’s sexist.” It’s like, “No, you don’t know Excel.” It’s an intuitive program. But that’s the kind… That’s the kind of equality I want for women. I want true equality for women. I want women to be just as good as men, just as mediocre, and just as shitty. You know? I want us to be in charge of stuff. I’d love to see us leave our kids.\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I’d like to see a few serial killers. Good ones too. Like, good, creepy, dead-eyed, wear-your-skin serial killers.\\n[woman whooping]\\nThe kind Netflix makes a documentary about, and afterwards, people are like, “She’s cute, though.” [chuckles]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMichelle Wolf, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

People get worked up.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the news, “Gender neutral bathrooms. Should be a man and a woman.”\\n“I don’t wanna shit next to trans person.”\\nWhoa, dude. I don’t wanna shit next to anybody, okay?\\nI’ve never thought about the type of person I’m shitting next to.\\nWho’s got time to decipher someone’s background when you gotta take a dump?\\nIf I get diarrhea at a restaurant, I run to the bathroom.\\nI’m not like, “Oh no, a Puerto Rican.”\\n“Agh!”\\n“I can’t take a BM next to a PR. What the hell?”\\nI agree there should be two bathrooms, not divided by gender.\\nI think you should divide it by pissing and shitting. Hmm.\\nI don’t care who I’m shitting next to as long as they’re also shitting, right?\\nBut if I walk into the shit room and see a trans person piss, I’m gonna go, “Hey, you’d better transition to a shit right now.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“You’re in the wrong room, sister.”\\n“Brother. Whatever.”\\nBut there’s a big debate these days.\\n“Are biological women the same as trans women?”\\n“Are the different? The same? Boopity boop.”\\nI think it’s like Coke and Pepsi.\\nAlways that one guy, “I love Coke, but I hate Pepsi.”\\n“All I got’s Pepsi.”\\n“I hate that shit.”\\nHand him a Pepsi, “Here’s a Coke.” He goes, “This is pretty good.”\\nI’m like, “Well, you just fucked a trans person.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[WHOOPING, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah, it’s all fluid, right?\\nThere’ll always be that guy who goes, “Some people have no gender.”\\nYeah, that’s Coke Zero. [CHUCKLES]\\nBut what the hell do I know?\\nI grew up in the ’90s. It was like, “I don’t see color.”\\n“We’re all the same. Treat everybody equally.”\\nNow, we’re obsessed with everyone’s differences.\\nYou flip through HBO Max, it’s all these categories.\\n“Trans Stories.”\\n“Strong Black Women.”\\n“Asian Culture.”\\nI know you’re trying to be progressive, but porn’s been doing this shit for 30 years.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou’re never gonna out-inclusive porn.\\nAll these networks patting themselves on the back.\\n“We have a gay section.”\\nPorn’s like, “We have a gay, senior citizen, dwarf in a wheelchair section.”\\n“You’re not more open-minded than us, right?”\\nTalk about representation.\\nI’ve been watching Asian culture since high school.\\nHBO’s like, “We have a family section.”\\nPorn’s like, “We got that and stepfamily.

Beautiful.\\nDefinitely the better-looking gender, I think we all agree.\\nLike, ladies, you guys are even sexy on accident.\\nYou see a woman bend over or see down her shirt for a second.\\nYou’re like, “Whoa!” That’s a great moment.\\nYou see a guy in short shorts, something pops out.\\nYou’re like, “Oh, call the police.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah, the female form, it’s a work of art.\\nLadies, you look better the more skin you’re showing.\\nBikini, lingerie, mini skirt.\\nMen look better the more covered up we are.\\nBusiness suit, tuxedo, man in uniform.\\nI think a female strip club should be a guy coming out naked and slowly putting clothing on, you know?\\nSome lady’s like, “Whoo! Put on that blazer! Yeah!”\\nBy the end, she’s like, “Oh damn, he’s an astronaut.” [SIGHS]\\nLadies, you’re so hot, you touch your own body in bed.\\nYou’re on top like, “Oh yeah.”\\nNo guy wants to touch himself. No guy’s like, “All right, look at that.”\\nNo.\\n‘Cause I think you’re more turned on by men’s skills than our actual looks.\\nMen, we’re all visual.\\nWe go to a strip club, “Yeah, dance on that pole.”\\nAt a female strip club, it’s more like, “Yeah, install that pole.” Hey?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd you’re so mysterious. We have no idea what turns you on.\\nYou know everything that turns us on. We don’t know what you like.\\nI asked my wife, “What turns you on?” She goes, “I like a man who listens.”\\nI don’t know. I tuned out. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nEvery woman’s different. I asked a friend, “What turns you on?”\\nShe goes, “I like a man with intelligence.”\\nHow does that work in the bedroom? Some guy’s like, “Ah, hypotenuse.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI’m not a big strip club guy. I’m too awkward. I’m not cool.\\nSome guys are good at strip clubs.\\nGetting a lap dance, they’re like, “Yeah, bitch.”\\nOr whatever. I don’t know.\\nI’m too awkward.\\nI was in the back room once, getting a dance.\\nLady’s grinding me. She’s like, “What do you do?”\\nI’m like, “I’m a comedian.” She goes, “Tell me a joke.”\\nI was like, “Look, I’m not at work. You are.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nShe didn’t like that joke.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah.\\n[APPLAUSE CONTINUES]\\nBut hey, I’m doing all right.\\nI had sex with my wife today. Or, as she calls it, microdosing.\\nAnd, uh…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI remember when we got engaged.\\nShe was like, “You gotta post about the engagement.”\\nI was like, “Why? This is between us. Who cares about social media?”\\nShe’s like, “I want people to know.”\\n“Well, I want you to post about that threesome we had.”\\nShe’s like, “Why would I do that?” I’m like, “I want people to know.”\\nShe’s like, “Are you kidding? This is a bond between two people.”\\nI’m like, “This is better, it’s a bond between three.”\\nShe’s like, “I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a kid.”\\nI was like, “Ah…”\\nA lot of girls dream about a wedding. A lot of boys dream about a threesome.\\nAnd the dream is very similar.\\nWho we’ll invite, where we’ll do it, and we gotta get a photographer.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nShe’s a great egg, but I can always find a new way to piss her off.\\nTouched her stomach the other day, she flipped out.\\nShe’s got a nice stomach, just self-conscious about it.\\nPeople talk about private parts, like boobs are a private part.\\nI walk in a room, grab my girl’s boobs, she’s like, “Hey, how are ya?”\\nI grab her stomach, she’s like, “You wanna fucking die today?”\\nThat’s a private part, right?\\nIn the bedroom, she’ll cover it up so I can’t see it.\\nWhich I get, ’cause I feel the same way about my butt hole.\\nI don’t want anybody seeing that thing.\\nEven after wild sex, I still have to walk out of the room backwards.\\nThe stomach for a woman is the butt hole for a man.\\nThe condition of both is very dependent on diet.\\n[LAUGHTER, WHOOPING]\\nShe’ll be like, “I can’t hook up, I had a burrito.”\\nI’m like, “Same here.”\\nBut, like any couple, we fight. We got into it last week.\\nShe’s like, “I’m gonna level with you. I need more compliments.”\\nI was like, “Oh shit.” So I took her to a construction site. Oh.\\nBut it gets confusing.\\nWe were walking around and a homeless guy catcalled her.\\n“Nice ass, baby!”\\nI was like, “There you go, huh?”\\nShe’s like, “What are you gonna do about that guy?”\\n“I’m gonna go over and give that guy a couple of bucks.”\\nShe’s like, “I don’t want a compliment from him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m like, “A compliment’s a compliment.”\\nShe’s like, “I’ll take you to a gay bar, see how you like it.”\\nWe go to a gay bar, guys are all over me.\\n“What do you think about that?” I was like, “I fucking love it.” So…\\nSo that backfired, you know?\\nThe new fight is, I bought a vintage car. She hates this car.\\nShe goes, “I think you like the car more than you like me.”\\nIt’s not that I like it more, it’s just easier to understand.\\nLet’s be honest, ladies. You can be vague and secretive.\\nCar’s pretty cut and dry.\\nOut of gas? Empty. Overheated? Hot. There’s no game for the car.\\nThe engine of a car has never caught on fire and the dashboard says, “I’m fine.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nHmm.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah. I don’t know.\\n[WHISTLING]\\nMen compare women to cars all the time. Ladies, you’re the opposite of a car.\\nYour car is quiet, it’s running great. Girlfriend’s quiet, you’re in deep shit.\\nGirlfriends and cars have nothing in common.\\nExcept for the fact that my last one was stolen by a Black guy.\\n[GROANS]\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI think men are more like cars.\\nWe’re gassy, we’re fixer-uppers. We kill people sometimes, right?\\nAnd, ladies, if we stop working, you can just go electric.\\n[IMITATES BUZZING]\\nI think men are more like cars. Ladies, you’re more like horses.\\nBeautiful creatures, long legs, ponytail.\\nExpensive to feed, always need new shoes, we slap you on the ass, and once we see you take a shit, the magic’s over. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut we got some couples here tonight, huh?\\nThere you go. You guys swing?\\nNo. Um…\\nYou can tell you’re close with your lady when she starts farting around you.\\nI think that’s the true test.\\nAnd I get it, ladies. It’s a biological function.\\nBut can we keep it under ten a day? What do you think?\\nYou don’t want that to become your thing.\\nYou’re at a party. “Who ripped one?” “Classic Claire.”\\n[CHUCKLES] “Every time.”\\nFarting for a woman’s a tough look.\\nFarting for a woman is like crying for a man.\\nWe all pretend to be open-minded, but that shit’s a bummer, you know?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThe other day, I was going down on her. She farted, I started crying.\\nShe was like, “Aw, you need a tissue?”\\nI was like, “Do you?”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat about fart’s wacky cousin, queef?\\nYes.\\n[CHEERING]\\nLove a good queef.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nA lot of ladies get self-conscious, embarrassed.\\nI say queef it up, sister. It’s nice to see that thing talking for once.\\nLove a queef. Big fan of the queef.\\nI went down on a girl once, she queefed, my hair went… [EXHALES]\\nIt’s a hell of a time. You know what a queef’s like?\\nIt’s like when the subway goes by and you get that dirty air, you know?\\nSure, it’s not the most sanitary, but it’s hot down there, it’s refreshing, goddammit!\\nI’m pro-queef.\\nBut you gotta be empathetic to the queefs, fellas.\\nLadies, you’re more empathetic, more thoughtful.\\nYou think about others. Men don’t think about others.\\nWe think about ourselves, you know?\\nI go to dinner with my girl, she says, “Can’t eat here, the chef’s homophobic.”\\nI’m like, “Great, we’re not gay. We’re good.” Yeah?\\nThat’s how I think. Men don’t think about others.\\nI was watching tennis with my buddy. I go, “You know this guy hit his wife?”\\nMy friend goes, “Yeah, he’s got a great backhand.”\\nJesus Christ.\\nYou’re deeper, ladies. More emotionally intelligent.\\nAsk a woman what she likes in a guy, she’ll tell you what she likes because of how it makes her feel. “I like guys who are strong. I feel safe.”\\n“I like guys with money. I feel taken care of.”\\nGuys tell you what we like, not how we feel.\\n“What do you like in a woman?”\\n“A fat ass.”\\n“Hmm. How’s that make you feel?”\\n“Hard? I don’t know.”\\nGotta be tough to be a lady in a lot of ways.\\nSome perks, ladies, you know.\\nLike, you’re allowed to announce your standards in public.\\nWhen men announce their standards, we look shittier.\\nI was hanging out with some friends. We’re drinking. Talking about our type.\\nMy gay friend was like, “I like muscles on a man.”\\nAll right, gay guy, muscles.\\nMy lady friend, “I like a tall guy.” Yeah, women like tall guys.\\n“What do you like, Mark?” “Skinny girls with big tits.”\\nThey all went, “Oh, what a fucking asshole.”\\n“How come you’re allowed to shame me for what I’m attracted to?”\\n“You guys were shallow. Why can’t I be?”\\n“You like tall guys. I’m not a tall guy. I wasn’t like, ‘Classic whore.'”\\nI’d rather be taller but that’s my issue.\\nShe’s like, “It’s messed up you won’t sleep with certain women.”\\n“What about the gay guy? He won’t fuck any women. Yell at him.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou wanna be a good guy, it just gets confusing.\\nLadies, where are we at on objectifying women? Is that bad?\\nIt’s tough. Some women say, “Don’t ever objectify a woman.”\\nBut ladies, you do it all day long.\\nAny time a woman posts on Instagram, every girl’s like, “Beautiful.” “Stunning.” “Sexy.”\\nNever seen a woman write, “Smart.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHuh. Interesting.\\nLadies, you don’t like when men objectify women if they’re hot. But if they’re traditionally unattractive, you love it.\\nSmoking hot girl walks in. “Damn, she’s sexy as hell.”\\n“Easy, creep.”\\nIf a lady rolls in on a scooter with an eye patch, “Damn, she’s sexy as hell.”\\n“This is a great guy right here.”\\nIsn’t he still a creep? If you’re not threatened, you’re on board.\\nA guy puts up a poster in his cubicle, big breasted swimsuit models,\\n“Jeez, you pig.” “Oh no, they’re trans.”\\n“Hey, good for you.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut isn’t he still a pig?\\n“Is that a Victoria’s Secret poster?” “Yeah, it’s the one with Down’s syndrome.”\\n“Oh, carry on. Carry on.”\\n[GROANING]\\nLike, why does that make it okay?\\nHow about that, a Victoria’s Secret model with Down’s syndrome. That’s exciting.\\nYeah, she’s really pretty. I mean, I’d go downs on her.\\nYou know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGood for her. I support. I’m on board. I’m a fan.\\nI feel bad for the girl who didn’t get the job.\\n“Who got it?” “You don’t wanna know.”\\n“Kill yourself. Get out of town. Change career. Don’t tell anybody.”\\nBut I also understand, ladies.\\nYou’ve been held down by your looks for generations. That sucks.\\nMy brother’s got a cute little daughter. My mom got her a Barbie.\\nThe wife’s like, “No daughter of mine is playing with Barbie.”\\n“Why not?” “Barbie sets unrealistic body standards for girls.”\\nOf course Barbie’s unrealistic. That’s why kids like her.\\nNobody wants a realistic toy.\\nLike every man toy. Twelve-pack, huge arms, giant legs. They’re toys.\\n“She’s gonna think she has to look like her.” No, she’s not.\\nI’ve never heard of a girl with a Barbie, “Damn, guess I gotta cut off my nipples.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGirls aren’t stupid.\\nI get it. It’s a new day. Gotta be inclusive.\\nGotta have plus-size Barbie, Chinese Barbie, blind Barbie.\\nYou know who’s never changed? Ken. Huh.\\nKen’s a good-looking guy, full head of hair.\\nThere’s no bald Ken, drunk Ken, abusive Ken.\\nNobody wants a realistic Ken.\\nHe pulls up in the Dream Car, gets a DUI.\\nBarbie’s like, “I told you so.”\\nHe’s like, “Shut up, you fucking skank. I’ll kill you”\\nNobody wants that.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nYeah.\\n[CHEERING, WHISTLING]\\nIf you ask me, Ken is quietly the most inclusive, ’cause he’ll fuck any Barbie. He doesn’t give a shit.\\n“What is that? Wheelchair Barbie? Yeah, roll her over here, I don’t care.”\\nNow, that’s inclusive.\\nI would’ve killed for a Barbie growing up.\\nMy parents wouldn’t buy us any cool toys. They bought us board games. [GROANS]\\nEven the names of board games are a bummer.\\nSorry. Right?\\nTrouble. Operation.\\nAnd the saddest of all, Life.\\n[GROANS]\\nWhat kind of twisted, messed up game for a kid is Life?\\nLife’s hard, life sucks.\\nYou play games to escape life, not dive right in.\\nYou got a kid outdoors, playing with his friends.\\nYou drag him inside to play a game about mortgage and divorce?\\n[GROANS] That’s too real.\\n“Pick a card, Timmy. What’d you get?” “I got herpes.”\\n“It says you sent a tweet ten years ago that came back to haunt you.”\\n“You’re fired.”\\n“Man, life sucks.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHate a board game. Remember Clue? I hated Clue.\\nProfessor Plum in the study with the candlestick.\\nThat’s not relatable. Who’s dying from a candlestick?\\nYou gotta update that stuff. Make it stuff that kills people now.\\nPeanuts.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGender reveal party.\\nFentanyl. Cops.\\nUpdate it. Mark Normand in the hotel room under the BBW.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThat’s how I wanna go.\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah.\\nI did mention Fentanyl. We have an opioid crisis.\\n[MAN WHOOPS]\\nNobody seems to give a shit.\\nThat guy’s hopped up. Yeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah.\\nYeah. When I was a kid, all I heard was weed was the gateway drug.\\nRemember? “Weed is the gateway drug.”\\nI disagree. I think it’s cereal.\\nAll that sugar? Cereal’s getting kids high way younger than weed.\\nKids look like addicts when they wake up.\\n“Damn, I need a bowl.”\\nI mean, diabetes, obesity. We pump that shit into kids early.\\nThat’s why half the cereals are named after drugs.\\nSmacks. Right?\\nSpecial K. You know?\\nGolden Grahams. Already dealing in grams. I don’t know.\\nIf you go down the cereal aisle in Australia or Europe, it’s all health food. Heart healthy. Wholegrain. Fiber.\\nThe cereal aisle in America is like a fucking acid trip, right?\\nIt’s just bright colors and wacky cartoon characters.\\nEvery cereal mascot looks like a cracked-out addict, you know?\\nYou got a paranoid leprechaun and a jacked-up rabbit stealing shit from kids.\\nTony the Tiger’s clearly coked-up.\\n[STRAINED] “They’re great, yeah!”\\nHow about that wide-eyed toucan? “Hey, kids. Follow your nose.”\\n[CHUCKLES]\\nYeah.\\nI know fentanyl and opioid and all that stuff’s dark.\\nI like dark humor. Some people get upset. Everybody’s entitled to their opinion.\\nTo each his anal.\\nBut, you know. You’ve gotta admit, though, if we’re a society that gets upset about jokes, that’s a sign we got it pretty goddamn good, you know.\\nGuy in Ukraine’s getting his face shot. We got people here like, “Zingers, ugh.”\\nAlways blows my mind when somebody gets really upset about comedy.\\nI told a joke, this guy got pissed. He goes, “Apologize for that joke.”\\nI’m like, “Sorry?” He goes, “You didn’t mean that.”\\nI’m like, “I didn’t mean the joke either, you queef.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“What are we doing here?”\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nBut, you know, maybe it’s me.\\nMaybe it’s me. I’m too literal. Literal guy.\\nDefinitely hurt me in some social interactions, you know.\\nJust last week, I was at a party. Girl comes up to me.\\nShe goes, “Are you gay?” “Nah, I’m not gay.”\\nShe goes, “Whoa. Nothing wrong with being gay”\\nI’m like, “I know. Just saying I’m not.”\\n“You’re getting defensive.” “Well, I’m not gay.”\\n“There’s nothing wrong with it.” “I know, but I’m not.”\\nShe wouldn’t let it go. I got annoyed. I go, “Are you pregnant?”\\n“Screw you. I’m not pregnant.” “Nothing wrong with being pregnant.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut we made up eventually.\\nWe’re cool now, you know.\\nShe was like, “I should be honest.”\\n“I was pregnant for about three months in college.”\\nI was like, “Oh, that’s when I was gay.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut, you know, I’m an idiot.\\nBad socially.\\nI had a Tinder date ten years ago. Great date.\\nOne of those magical nights, everything clicked.\\nWent back to her place. Fooling around, naked, giggling.\\nShe goes, “Your Tinder pic, you look like a serial killer.”\\nI was like, “Damn, that’s not good.” Took the wind out of my sails.\\nShe goes, “What did you think of my pic?” “I thought you looked easy.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThat’s what she did. She flipped out. She went nuts.\\n“Why are you mad? Nothing wrong with being easy.”\\n“Serial killer? Way worse.” Right?\\n“You said I look like I murder people. I said you look fun.”\\n“Why are you mad? I should be mad at you.”\\nI didn’t get it. Then I realized, I’m not a serial killer.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nShe is easy.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nThat’s when I realized you can’t say what someone is to them.\\nThat’s mean. I learned that that night. You can’t say what someone is to them.\\nI’d never call a retarded person retarded. That’s just mean.\\nI’d call my friend retarded, ’cause he’s not retarded.\\nIf a friend spilled Pepsi on my laptop. “What are you doing, you retard?”\\nIf a retarded kid spilled Pepsi on my laptop, I’d be like, “Bubbles. Yay.”\\n‘Cause I’m not an asshole. I’m learning.\\n“By the way, I went on a date with a girl that looks easy.”\\n“You went on a date with a guy that looks like a killer.”\\n“What, are you fucking retarded?”\\n[LAUGHTER, CHEERING]\\nHmm.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nBut I didn’t mean to insult the lady, you know.\\n“You got a problem with easy women?” “I’m here. What are you talking about?”\\nI think it’s crazy.\\nIt’s 2023. We still make women feel bad for being promiscuous.\\nSluts are the best, right?\\nWhy make them feel bad?\\nThe best time to be a promiscuous woman was Native American times.\\nInca, Aztec, Mayan.\\nThey used to sacrifice virgins to the gods. Throw them in a volcano.\\nHoly shit. I’d be the biggest tramp on the reservation.\\nIt could save your life.\\nChief walks up. “Ma’am, crops are dying. We gotta sacrifice a virgin.”\\n“Are you a virgin?” “No, huge whore.”\\n“Huge whore.”\\n“You are way off, baby. Way off, all right?”\\n“I give the best arrowhead on this side of the wigwam, okay?”\\n“You don’t know what you’re dealing with. I put the ‘ho’ in Navajo out here, okay?”\\nYeah, you know my tribe name, Spread Eagle? That’s me.\\nYeah.\\nI think I like that system better.\\nReward the fun gals, get rid of the boring ones.\\nYou know there was some chief up on the volcano going, “You should’ve fucked me.”\\n“Whoa. Hey. All right. Shit. Look at that.”\\nNothing wrong with being promiscuous.\\nDon’t let anybody make you feel bad about that.\\nBut, ladies, you gotta own being sluts. Sometimes you slut-shame yourselves.\\nThat’s not gonna help the movement, huh?\\nYou have sex with a girl. You’re like, “I gotta go.”\\n“You’re gonna leave? I feel like a whore.”\\nIt’s like, “Yeah, you are.”\\n“And that’s okay.”\\n“I don’t want you to think I’m a slut.” “No, I knew.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThere’s nothing wrong with it, remember?\\nYou can’t tell people not to slut-shame and do it to yourself.\\nIt kills me when I see women trashing promiscuous women.\\n“How about Rachel? What a whore.” “What do you mean?”\\n“She fucks a new guy every weekend.” “So what? What do you do?”\\nEvery girl goes, “I get dinner and drinks out of him. Spend some money first.”\\n“Wait, you’re calling her a whore and you’re a prostitute.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nIsn’t that weirder? She’s banging guys she likes for free.\\nYou’re like, “How much lobster can I get with this clam?”\\nIsn’t that way whorier?\\nI don’t know.\\nWhat do I know? I’m a feminist.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nA lot of prostitutes walk around my neighborhood.\\nYou’re supposed to say sex worker now, but I’ve given enough money, I should be able to call them whatever I want. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nSex is just such a strange thing.\\nWe all have sex. We like sex. You guys have sex.\\nPlease, send me a video.\\nYou know, sex is fun. We like it.\\nIf you charge for it, all of a sudden there’s a stigma.\\nWeird. Sex is the only thing on earth that gets sadder when you go pro.\\nHuh.\\nNothing else is like that.\\nMaybe bowling.\\nHmm.\\n“My friend’s a great bowler.” “That’s cool.”\\n“My other friend’s a professional bowler.” “That’s a shame.”\\nEither way, bowling or prostitution, holes are getting fingered in an alley.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah.\\nYeah, I’ve been with a lot of promiscuous gals in my day.\\nPaid for a couple of big old aborshes.\\nThat’s a thing, you know.\\nOne time I left the abortion clinic with a lady and there’s a guy protesting.\\nHe goes, “You’re a goddamn murderer.”\\nI don’t know about murderer. I really more just hired a hitman.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHe’s like, “If it was up to me, you’d be in jail.”\\nIf I go to jail for this, I want murderer status.\\nI wanna look tough.\\nThe guys talking. “What are you in for?” “Grand theft auto.” “Assault.”\\nI’m like, “Murder.”\\nThey’re like, “Damn! Who’d you kill?”\\nI’m like, “Huh! A relative.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThey’re like, “Whoa, why’d you do that?” I’m like, “Caught him inside my girl.”\\n[CHUCKLES]\\nI miss that gal. She was fun, she was wild.\\nAfter the abortion, she was like, “We should celebrate with a drink.”\\nI was like, “I don’t think you should drink on an empty stomach.”\\n[LAUGHTER, GROANING]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nAh. All right.\\n[WHISTLING]\\nYeah.\\nBut, you know, it’s good you guys can come out for a yuk.\\nI know times are weird. The economy’s in the toilet.\\nGas prices are higher than Hunter Biden.\\nWho knows what’s going on out there, you know?\\nAll my friends are broke.\\nOne of my friends is broke but still buys the most crap.\\nHe just bought a Peloton.\\nYou ever see one of these things?\\nThree grand for this thing.\\nImagine explaining a Peloton to someone in a Third World country.\\nSome guy with no shoes on, on a dirt road, shabby clothes.\\n“Whoa, you spent $3,000 on a bike? Must be pretty fast.”\\n“Doesn’t move. Just sits in the living room.”\\n“In the living room? When you pedal, it generates power for your home?”\\n“No. Uses a lot of power. Got a big screen on the front.”\\n“Big screen? When you use it, you watch funny TV shows?”\\n“No, a better-looking person yells at you.”\\n“Oh. This thing sounds terrible. What’s the upside?”\\n“You eat too much takeout, you gotta burn some calories.”\\n“Whoa, whoa. What’s takeout?”\\n“That’s where a guy on a bicycle brings food to your house and you pay him.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“Wait. This guy’s got a real bike and you give him money? Why not do that?”\\n[SCOFFS] “What am I? A fucking immigrant? Come on.”\\nThat’s America. Yeah.\\nAny immigrants here tonight?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nHey, how are you? Where you from?\\nChina.\\n[MARK] China? All right. Sorry about the balloons. But, um, all right. Good one. Good to have you. Thank you. Just don’t cough.\\n[MAN] Ireland.\\nIreland? I was hoping for something browner.\\nAll right, okay.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThanks for being here. And you seem sober, which is shocking.\\nAll right.\\n[MAN] Pakistan.\\nPakistan? Hey, hopefully only one of us bombs.\\nI don’t even know if that’s a thing. Um…\\nMexicans? Are you Mexican, sir?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah, you’d look cute in a cage. All right.\\nSomebody check his papers, huh? All right.\\nSorry, that was a spicy one.\\nGood to have you. Sorry, sir. That joke was over the line.\\nAnd so are you. But, uh…\\nI’m jealous of immigrants, I really am. My buddy’s a Mexican immigrant. Been here eight years. He loves America. He never thinks about the bad parts. We got a lot of bad history. Slavery, Civil Rights, oppressing women, homophobia. He’s like, “I just got here.” [LAUGHS]\\nWhat a great position to be in.\\nAll the fun of America, not much of the hardship. It’s like becoming a firefighter on September 12th.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nImmigrants are great. Immigrants tend to appreciate America more than most Americans.\\nI’m from here, born and raised. I’m spoiled. I take it for granted. My grandparents are immigrants from Sicily. They never shut up. The American dream, the freedom, the opportunity. And I’m like, “Where the fuck’s my Uber Eats?” “Where the hell is that Pakistani with my food, goddammit?”\\nYeah. But I thought that was the big dream. You come to America, you make it big, you make a couple of bucks, you get rich. Boy, the rich thing is weird now. Feels like we hate rich people. Isn’t that weird? See that online a lot. “Fuck the rich, kill the rich, eat the rich.”\\nWhy are we all shitting on the thing we wanna be?\\nLike making fun of old people.\\n“Look at that old bastard. Probably shit his pants.”\\nYeah, that’s the goal.\\nWe’re all hypocrites.\\nWe all go to 7-Eleven, “Gimme that scratch-off.”\\nGuy goes by in a Ferrari. [IMITATES CAR]\\n“Rich prick. Come on, big money.”\\nWhich one is it? All of my friends are very left-leaning, liberal, “Down with hate, we gotta stop hate. But fuck rich people.”\\n“That feels pretty hateful.” “Well, I hate the 1%.”\\nLike, “Whoa, so you hate minorities?”\\nWe’re all so compassionate these days till someone’s doing better than you, then fuck them.\\nRich guy’s like, “My beach house burned down in Malibu.”\\n“Boo-fucking-hoo.”\\nHe’s like, “Well, my kids were in there.”\\n“I don’t get it. I invented something, now I don’t have feelings? Weird.”\\nAll these absolutes now. “Rich people are all evil.”\\nThat’s not how people work. They vary. Some are evil, some are nice.\\n“Cops are all bad.” No, some are bad, some are awesome.\\n“Teachers are heroes.” Some are heroes, some fuck their students.\\nRight?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd that student is a hero.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah. All right.\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nI don’t hate any group. I like all the groups, you know?\\nI also like racial jokes.\\nYeah, those kind of went away.\\nI grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood.\\nWe’d say horrible things to each other. Everybody got along.\\nYou can’t make those jokes anymore, and we seem more tense than ever.\\nIt was fun. Cut the tension, you know?\\nThey’d be like, “Mark, you can’t dance.” I was like, “Well, you can’t swim. Ah!”\\nWe’re still friends to this day.\\nThen some stiff white guy, “You can’t say that.”\\nYou don’t know our relationship. That’s what we do.\\nYou walk in on me choking my wife. “Call the police.” No, she loves that.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou don’t always know the relationship.\\nWe’re just so obsessed with race now, it’s always on my mind.\\nOn the phone with my insurance agent. “What color’s your car?”\\nI was like, “Jeez. I thought you were progressive.”\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nAnd, look, I’m a pretty progressive guy.\\nBut sometimes we get so progressive these days\\nwe actually end up kinda racist again.\\nI used to just have my friend. Now I’m very aware he’s my Black friend.\\n“Don’t say anything stupid. Don’t offend him.” That’s not progress.\\nI’m obsessed with his skin color now. Never thought about it before.\\nEverything I say, I’m second-guessing.\\n“You’re always banging your girlfriend. You’re like a sex slave.”\\nAh, shit. Ah.\\n“No, I’m just saying, you know, you’re whipped.”\\nAh, damn.\\n“No, I mean, you know, I just wanna hang.”\\n[GROANS]\\nHe’s like, “Screw this, I’m outta here.”\\n“All right, I’ll see you later.” Jesus Christ. Holy Hell.\\nThat’s not healthy.\\nHope no Jews are offended. We got any Jews here?\\n[WHOOPING, WHISTLING]\\nHey, all right!\\nGet ’em!\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nJust joking, Jews. Thanks for coming out. Love the tribe. And do something about this weather, will you?\\nYeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI love the Jews.\\nMy Jewish friends and my Black friends butt heads a lot over who had it worse.\\nThat’s a big argument. Slavery or the Holocaust?\\nGot heated one night, almost came to blows.\\nMy Black friend had to be like, “We’ve got stuff in common.”\\n“Let’s focus on that. We’re both oppressed.”\\n“Both contribute a lot to the arts, and our grandparents are both ashy.”\\n[LAUGHTER, GROANING]\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\nJust saying, Jews and Black people, a lot in common.\\nI go to my Black friend’s house, closet’s got a big pile of shoes.\\nGo to the Holocaust Museum, there’s a big pile of… You get it.\\nBut, no.\\nBig fan of the Jews. I hate to see the anti-Semitism bubbling up these days.\\nThat’s a bummer. Some people aren’t having it.\\nI heard one guy go, “These Jews are acting like babies.”\\n“These Jews are acting like babies.”\\nI disagree. I think Jews are tough, I think they’re resilient.\\nI do, however, think babies are acting like Jews.\\nYeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI was at a diner last week with my buddy. He’s Jewish.\\nA baby one table over. They were doing the same shit.\\nBoth wearing little hats, you know.\\nBaby’s uncomfortable, squirming. I look at my friend, he’s like, “My back.”\\nThe bill came, they both shit their pants and left.\\nBut, you know, I make jokes, but I try to be a good honky ally to my Black brethren.\\nAn awkward moment for a white guy is going to see a slave movie with your Black friend.\\nAwkward. Did that a few years back. Still haunts me.\\nHanging out with two Black guys. “We should see a movie.” “Hell, yeah.”\\n“We should go see 12 Years A Slave.” I was like, “Ah. I’ll get the tickets.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“It’s on me.”\\nWe had to see 12 Years A Slave in Harlem in the theater.\\nI’m the only white guy in there. I’m so uncomfortable, I’m shaking.\\nMy friend’s like, “What’s your problem?” “I want to leave, but I can’t.”\\nHe’s like, “Now you know how the slaves felt.”\\nGod damn.\\nHe’s like, “We did 400 years. You can do two hours.”\\nI was like, “Yes, Master.” [CHUCKLES]\\nAnd that is how I made slavery about me.\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nThat’s what white people do. Yeah.\\nBut I think we’re making progress.\\nWe’ve got a Black mermaid now. That’s big. Yeah.\\nCan’t have a Jewish mermaid, ’cause you guys can’t fuck with shellfish.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nWe’ve got a Black mermaid. They’re making more.\\nPixar’s doing a Rapunzel movie.\\n“Rapunzel, let down your hair.” Rapunzel’s gonna be Black.\\nWhich is cool. But the Prince is gonna be white.\\nGonna be awkward when he goes, “Rapunzel, let down your hair.”\\nAnd she’s gonna be like, “You’re not touching this shit.”\\nBut it is horrible when you see some real racism go down.\\nI was on the bus last week. Black guy tried to get on the bus.\\nDriver’s like, “We’re full, buddy.”\\nHe’s like, “I’m just trying to get on the bus.”\\nHe goes, “You’re treating me like this ’cause I’m Black.”\\nI’m like, man, that is messed up to treat someone differently ’cause they’re Black.\\nThen I realized, wait a minute, we all do that.\\nBlack guy says the n-word, no big deal.\\nWhite lady, you say the n-word, I get an erection.\\nYou know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut sometimes you should treat groups differently, you know?\\nIf my white friend’s getting wild, “Dude, you’re crazy. You’re an animal.”\\nIf my Black friend’s getting wild, I’m like, “Dude.”\\n“You’re crazy.” [CHUCKLES]\\nI’m way nicer to Black people than I am to white people.\\nI was at the gym, white guy playing his music really loud.\\nWe’re all like, “It’s a public space. It’s rude. Get the hell out of here.”\\nHe leaves. Twenty minutes later, a Black guy comes in.\\nHe starts playing his music really loud. We’re all like, “Good tunes, brother.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI had a guy go, “You do that ’cause you’re scared of Black people.”\\nI’m not scared of Black people. I’m scared of cell phone cameras.\\nThat is terrifying, you know?\\nAt a restaurant, a Black guy’s like, “I got you.”\\nLike, “Whoa. I said vinegar. Vinegar. What the hell?”\\n“Salt and vinegar.”\\nThat’s a dicey one.\\nI like a dicey zinger. Some people get weird.\\nYou know who doesn’t like dicey jokes? TV writers.\\nThey’ve turned down everything I ever pitched.\\nI pitched this great sitcom about the 9/11 terrorists, but of course, they shot down the pilot.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI know.\\nYou guys are fun. A lot of crowds are sensitive.\\nPeople are getting sensitive. My buddy is a vegan. Holy shit.\\nI’m walking on eggshells around him. He really hates that.\\nHe’s a great guy, but going out to eat with him is a nightmare.\\nHe’s got to have the Impossible Burger. You know about this?\\nLooks like meat, tastes like meat, feels like meat, but it’s not meat.\\nWeird. You hate something but want something just like it. Huh.\\nIt’s like a lesbian with a strap-on.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou hate dick, but it looks like a dick, feels like a dick.\\nI can’t believe it’s not dick.\\nIt’s beyond dick.\\nWe got any lesbians here tonight?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nHey, all right.\\nI think that was a guy. Uh…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nLesbians are underrepresented.\\nI travel the country doing comedy. I see gay bars everywhere.\\nThey always have funny names, like The Manhole or The Back Door.\\nWhere’s all the fun lesbian bars? Where’s Clitz, with a z?\\nClitz. Perfect name for a lesbian bar, ’cause no guy could find it.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd we’ll put it right in the hood. Aha.\\n[BELCHES]\\nAll right. Yeah.\\n[CHEERING]\\nComedy. All right.\\n[WHISTLING, APPLAUSE]\\nBut, hey, it’s good you guys are out now, ’cause you’re not watching the news. Too much news.\\nThe news is dark. It’s on 24/7.\\nThe news is more twisted than ever. Saw a news headline the other day.\\n“Transgender inmate impregnates female prisoner.”\\nI was like, “Wow.”\\n“Where is that porn?”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI’ve been watching porn my whole life, never saw a title that creative, right?\\nMan, the news is dark. The news is more fucked-up than porn now.\\nAnd it’s on everywhere. Every airport, bar, restaurant.\\nPut some porn on. I think we’d be in a better mood.\\nI was at the Amtrak station the other day. There was news on the wall, on TV.\\n“Man attacks multiple people on trains.”\\nJeez, I’m about to get on an Amtrak.\\nPut some porn on, that’d be better.\\nThen it’s, “Man runs a train on multiple people.”\\nAll right! Now I’m ready to board. Choo-choo. [LAUGHS]\\nThe news is crazy. Isn’t it weird we have two news channels in America that tell you two completely different news?\\nHow did that happen? Just tell me the news.\\nI don’t want your spin or bias.\\nThank God we don’t do that with the weather.\\nWouldn’t that be insane, if we had political, opinionated weather?\\nWe’re going to the beach tomorrow, let’s check the left-wing weather.\\nBoop.\\n“Hey, folks. 90 degrees outside. Beautiful day for an abortion.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“We got some dark clouds coming in. Excuse me, clouds of color.”\\n“And, as you can see, we’ve got tropical storm Kelly brewing.”\\n“Slowly transitions to Hurricane Kevin, but we don’t judge.”\\n“We’re not sure what the future holds, but it’s female. Back to you, they/them.”\\nHoly moly, I was just trying to get the goddamn weather.\\nThat was weird. I got nothing out of that. All right.\\nLet’s check the right-wing weather. Maybe that will be more informative.\\nBoop.\\n“Hey, folks. Grab your boots, it’s 100% chance of storming the Capitol.”\\n“Oh yeah. Gonna be a lot of hailing and heiling out there, and…”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“We got some ice in the Midwest.”\\n“We need some ICE at the border, I’ll tell you that right now.”\\n“Grab your coats, ’cause we hate snowflakes. Ooh!”\\n“Praise the Lord, and back to you, sugar tits.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nUh-huh.\\nAll right.\\nYeah, the news, it’s all politics now.\\nI’m so sick of politics. It’s the new sports team.\\nPeople make it their whole personality. It’s fricking exhausting. Yeah.\\nI look at politicians the same way I look at CBD gummies.\\nA lot of people believe in them, but I’m not sure they do anything.\\nThey don’t fix problems anymore, just change the name.\\n“We’re not in a recession, it’s a financial hiccup.”\\nWhat? We’re all broke.\\nThe banks are failing. What are you talking about?\\nThey do it with everything. “He’s not obese, he’s a person of size.”\\nWhat? He’s fat as shit.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“He’s not homeless, he’s unhoused.”\\nHe just diarrhea-d on my porch.\\nLike, who cares what we’re calling it. Let’s fix it.\\nHow long till bad guys start doing that? “I’m not racist, I’m ethnically choosy.”\\nHmm?\\n“I’m not a school shooter, I’m a student body minimizer.”\\nHuh?\\n[APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER]\\nAh, school shootings.\\nIt’s a problem.\\nIt’s a problem in this country. I was just in Canada.\\nThey’re nicer than us. They don’t shoot each other.\\nThey stab. Isn’t that nice? It’s kinda romantic.\\nWe shoot in America. More efficient.\\nShooting somebody is like breaking up via text. Easy, no mess.\\nStabbing is like breaking up in person.\\nYou see that look in their eye. “I know. This is hard for me too.”\\nGet back to your buddy, “How’d it go?” You’re like, “She fucking freaked out.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnother reason women are better than men, you don’t see a lot of female school shooters.\\nWhat’s going on there? I googled it, there’s been two.\\nHuh. Anybody ever heard of them?\\nIsn’t that weird? Whether it’s gun violence or the WNBA…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n…nobody’s watching these female shooters.\\nMan or woman.\\nGotta put up some more numbers, ladies.\\n[APPLAUSE]\\nI think I can solve school shootings.\\nI know people love guns. It’s America, people wanna buy a gun.\\nBut I think if a high-school kid buys a semiautomatic weapon, that should be a big deal. That should be public.\\nLet’s make that an event, like a wedding.\\nYou gotta send invitations, get your family to the gun shop.\\nThe shop owner, he’s like the priest.\\nHe holds up the gun, “If anyone has any objections, speak now, or this guy will forever own this piece.”\\nAnd we get some feedback.\\n“I’m his uncle. I don’t think he should have that gun ’cause he was molested.”\\n“I know that ’cause I did it.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“Probably a bad idea.”\\nI think half of these shooter kids are incel, virgin weirdos.\\nThey need to get laid, but it’s harder to get laid than it is to buy a gun.\\nYou can buy a gun at Walmart. You don’t wanna fuck anybody at Walmart.\\nThat’s why every gun shop should double as a whorehouse.\\nSlow these kids down a little bit, you know?\\nSome angry kid comes in, “I need an AR-15.”\\nWe’re like, “Whoa, whoa. How about a Brazilian 18?”\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah!\\n[CHEERING]\\nYeah. Then some kid has sex with her, goes back to school, he’s like, “What the fuck was I so angry about?”\\n“Holy hell. Life is good!”\\nSomeone’s like, “Are you smoking?” He’s like, “No, I’m paying a hooker.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAll right, thanks a lot. I’m Kevin Hart. You guys are great.\\nHave a good night. Comedy! Thank you.\\nQueef it up!\\nPraise Allah!\\nI’m gay!\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\n[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]\\n[WHISTLING, CHEERING]\\n[MUSIC CONTINUES]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMark Normand, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Denver!\\n[cheering and applause continues]\\n[Patton laughs] Oh my God! Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\n[cheering continues]\\nThank you. Oh my God! Yes! Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. Um… Hey, I broke my foot. Yeah. That’s how I started my year. I broke my foot. Uh… It was… It took two… It happened in two parts. Uh, the second part was I slipped off a curb and I landed wrong. That was the second part. The first and most important part was I turned 53. That is the crucial part.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI… You turn… Once you get past 50, everything’s fatal. I… When I was in my twenties, I would walk into propellers and put some Bactine on it. I was fine. And now if a pine cone falls near me, my spine implodes. I don’t know what… Like that. [audience laughs] Broke my foot, and then the day after… I’m gonna drop a name. All right. Uh, the day after I broke my foot, Glenn Howerton, my friend Glenn Howerton…\\n[audience cheers]\\n…who is almost 50, but for this bit he’s over 50. I needed to… Come on, who cares about logic? He broke his collarbone. So I called him up, gave him a little solidarity, a little support. “Hey, man. I broke my foot.” “What happened?” In my mind, I’m thinking, “Well, he was probably reaching for a bag of SunChips wrong, and his collarbone broke or something.” And he said, “Yeah, I was snowboarding. I landed a flip wrong.” All right. Fuck off. Fuck off.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou don’t need to go to that much hassle. Once you get to a certain age, you don’t need… I don’t even think that’s what happened. I think he’s lying to me. I think… I think somebody slammed a door near him, and then his collarbone fell into his ass cheek. And then he told his wife, “Duct-tape me to a snowboard and push me down a black diamond trail, please.” “Give me some dignity for God’s sake.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna drop another name. A month after I broke my foot, Tony Hawk broke his…\\n[audience cheering]\\n…broke his femur in two. Pow! Landed a vertical wrong. In his warehouse, doing his verticals, landed it wrong. Broke his femur. DMs me a picture of his X-ray. He’s like, “Looks like we’re in the same boat, buddy.” I’m like, “No, we’re fucking not.” You… [audience laughing] You just Jackie-Channed yourself into even more coolness. [audience laughs] He found a whole other level of cool. I slipped off a curb like someone’s aunt that saw a bird. That is how I went down.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI went down in the most embarrassing way possible. [audience chuckling] And the one weird thing that happened, ’cause when I did it I was still in my 23-year-old denial head of, “I just twisted my ankle. I’ll drive home.” I was at work. “I’ll drive home. I’ll be fine.” Driving home, it’s hurting worse. “Oh, this actually might be a real thing.” I get home. I can barely get out of the car now. And I’m limping across the street to my house. And it’s really hurting, and then a car pulls up, these two women are driving, and the driver rolls her window down and says, “You okay?” I’m like, “Oh, I twisted my ankle. I live right here.” “I’m going inside, put some ice on it.” And then, and this haunts me, she said, “Well, don’t give up.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhich… Wait. What? Holy shit! What was the look on my face? [audience laughing] What did I… Did she… “He’s gonna kill himself. Pull over. Pull over.” “Hey, don’t give up.” “Let me play this Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush song. This’ll really…” “Let’s listen to this.” Maybe that was just my face left over from the shutdown and the pandemic. Is that how my face permanently is now? Because I didn’t do the shutdown well at all. I did a bad shutdown. I planned a great shutdown. I planned an amazing… Remember when the shutdown happened? Supposed to stay home, and you had that little memory of all the times you said, “If I could just get a month off, I could get my shit together.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I could get my life… I just need a month off.” I planned a great shutdown. I executed the worst one ever. Oh my God, the list I made. The list we all made. We all made the same list? Yes, you did. All the great books you were gonna read. All the great books. All the skills you were gonna learn. Oh my God, we couldn’t wait to work on ourselves. If I had actually followed the list that I made, there’d be a different man standing in front of you right now. He’d be 30 pounds lighter. He’d be speaking fluent Italian.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhen all of you walked in, there would have been a handmade raspberry almond crumble tart on everyone’s chair, on each chair. I would have hand-milled the flour this morning. [audience laughing] You would have eaten it off of an origami plate. [audience laughs] When you’re done eating, you throw the plate down, it pops up into a frog. Oh my God! Oh, the plans I had! [audience laughing] I didn’t do any of that shit. I ate Doritos for breakfast, and I watched Deadwood twice all the way through. Watched it. Finished it. Back to episode one. Hit play.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat’s all I fucking did. And then I went crazier than a barn full of clown pubes. That is what I did during the shutdown. And listen, when I… When I say, “Crazier than a barn full of clown pubes…” [audience laughing] …I’m not kink-shaming. I’m not judging. [audience laughs] Clowns have as much right to have a varied and experimental, adventurous sex life. I’m saying the source of the crazy isn’t the clown pubes. It’s the having the thought and then the follow-through of “I’m gonna fill this barn…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…with the p…” I just want that to be clear. That the source of the crazy is the barn. The barn full of pubes isn’t even the crazy. It was the act of filling the barn… Listen, if you… If you just filled a barn with pubes, you’ve checked off the crazy box. [audience laughing] But this person went, “I’m putting obstructions in my way.” “I will only collect the pub…” Also, how do you… There’s no way to know. Clown pubes don’t look different. Like, they’re not bright orange. They’re not rainbow-colored. Look. Some are, but a lot… There’s a lot of… Listen. There… There’s a lot of non-clown pubes that are bright orange and rainbow-colored. That’s not what I’m saying here. What I’m saying is there’s no way that… Okay, this is what I’m saying. Wait. Fuck. Okay. If you… Like, okay, if you’re walking around…\\n[audience laughing]\\n…and there’s a barn, and you open those two big doors, there’s a wall of pubes, and you go, “Well, there’s a maniac roaming the countryside.” If someone said, “Those are only clown pubes.” Like, “Oh! We gotta call the National Guard.” Wait a minute. What? ‘Cause there’s no way to prove that. [audience laughing] Oh, okay, wait. You could do this. Every time… Every time that you collect… Not… Not a… Not a clump. That’s gross. Not a clump of… No. [audience laughing] Clump is too gross. Thatch? No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThatch is too folksy. That’s… That’s the other… Like, if Cracker Barrel opened a BDSM store, they would call it the Thatch of Pubes. That’s what it would be called. You’d go down to the Th… It’d probably be connected to the Cracker Barrel. You’d go in, get a nice breakfast, then go, “Hang on. I gotta pop into the Thatch of Pubes.” [audience laughs] “Pay the bill. I’ll meet you at the front.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThatch of Pu…\\n♪ Thatch of Pubes ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughing] We… ♪ We’ve got nipple clamps And scented lubes ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\nWe’ve got floggers, and paddles, and dildos. Oh my! And a tower of butt plugs that kisses the sky. [audience laughs] Tell ’em Petunia the pube pig sent ya. [audience laughs] Oink. All right. Um… [audience laughs] Handful. Handful of clown pubes. That’s non-gender specific. Every time you collect a handful of clown pubes, you take a Polaroid. You have a Polaroid, so you’re kneeling down. You’re collecting the pubes. You got your baggy. Gotta do it full length. Get the whole clown in there. He or she’s gotta be in their wig, their makeup, holding that day’s newspaper… [audience laughing] …so you know. Then you take a hole-punch, punch a hole through the Polaroid, get a ribbon, put it through that hole, tie the other end of the ribbon to the… the… the handful of pubes, toss it in the barn… Every handful of pubes is accounted for. There you go. And that’s how you would pro… Fuck, no. No, you can’t. You know why? No, that doesn’t work, because then someone can go, “Technically, you didn’t fill the barn with pubes because the ribbon and the Polaroid took up…” No, it has to be complete confidence in the speaker and total trust in the listener. When you say I tho… This is what’s happening right now, okay? We’re starting this set out. Let’s go on a journey for the next hour. I started off pretty strong, I think. I think I’ve won your trust, but you know what? You shouldn’t 100%… No. Not yet though.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBecause what you’ve got… Listen. What I’ve done, comedically, creatively, I have opened the barn doors. [audience laughing] And there’s a wall of pubes. [audience laughing] And yes, it’s impressive, but you’re right to go, “You know what?” “I bet that wall of pubes, I bet that’s a half an inch thick.” “And there’s a big sheet of plywood behind, and the rest of the barn is empty.” “I’ve been screwed over too many…” You’re right to think that. What I’m… This is what I’m doing. As a comedian, I’m inviting you… I’m saying I want you to run as hard as you can into this wall of pubes, and then, I want you to fight your way back, just fight your way to the back of the barn… [audience laughing] …until you’re cocooned in pubes. You know what I mean? At the back. And when your hand hits that back wall, you will think, “I met a man of honor.” That is what you will think. [audience laughing] That is what I want for us. Not me, not you, us. All of us. That’s what I want. Those are the kind of bits I wrote during the shutdown. I’d be awake for eight days in a row… [applause] Five in the morning, “The fucking Polaroid doesn’t even work!” Goddamn it! [audience cheering and applauding] I bought a trampoline.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot a giant backyard… One of those little workout ones. Yeah. Little tiny trampoline. It’s called a rebounder. Awesome. You get up on it. You hop up and down, get the lymphatic system going, “Here you go. Ooh. Out, in. Forward, back. Ski it out.” Great workout. Got it right at the beginning of the pandemic. “I’m gonna stay fit during this thing, man. I got my new rebounder.” It came out of the box, not a speck of dust on it. Oh, I was so excited. I could feel how excited the rebounder was. You could feel it. He was like, “I’m gonna make a difference in this house.” “I belong here. I’m gonna change things for the better.” I’m like, “That’s right, little rebounder. Wanna go inside the house?” “You wanna go in the gym?” He’s like, “Yeah.” We have a gym in our house. It’s a room with an elliptical in it. We call it a gym. [audience laughs] I take him inside. Oh, he’s so excited. I put him down. “I’ll see you tomorrow, little rebounder.” He goes, “Yeah.” We both looked over at the elliptical. [audience laughs] Against the wall. Clothes hanging off of it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nCovered in dust. And I could feel the rebounder’s heart break. I could feel his… You know what it felt like? It felt like the rookie cop fresh out of the academy. He’s like, “Give me the worst precinct in town. I’ll turn it around!” “I’ve got progressive policing techniques, community outreach.” “I’ll make a difference.” And he shows up that first day, big thermos of green tea, little keto lunch, he’s all excited. Looks over in the corner, “Who’s at his desk?” The old homicide cop. [audience laughs] Eight bullet holes in him. Eleven colostomy bags. [audience laughing] He’s having his seventh Viceroy of the morning. [audience laughing] [Patton exhales] That’s the elliptical. [audience laughing] Looks at the little rookie rebounder, “You’re gonna learn, kid.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You think I didn’t have dreams when I came here, huh?” “I was top of the line!” “You can stream movies on me, TV shows, mountain programs, everything!” “Oh! I was gonna turn this house of fatties around.” [audience laughing] “That guy that just dropped you off, he was on me day one.” “Cute little workout outfit.” “Little iPhone. He downloaded a bunch of podcasts on it.” “Ooh, a thinker!” [audience laughing] “He gets up on me, stretch those little fat thighs, pumping them up and down.” [grunting] “Thought he was gonna go the distance.” “He didn’t make it past the first Blue Apron ad.” [inhales, exhales] [audience laughing] “Hopped off of me.” “Went and checked his texts in the crapper.” [audience laughs] “He never came back.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Oh, he’ll be here tomorrow.” “Oh, he’ll be in his little workout outfit.” “He’ll probably put a little playlist on his iPhone.” “Yeah.” “He’s a Gen X-er in his fifties.” “I bet it’ll be all early ’80s New Wave pop.” [audience laughs] “That’s how he’s gonna get thin. Nostalgia.” [audience laughs] “He’ll hop up on you, start jumping up and down like a gibbon full of Skittles.” [audience laughs] “What’ll be the first song he listens to? I can call it right now.” “It’ll be the Go-Go’s ‘Our Lips Are Sealed.'” “That’ll be the first song.” “And you’ll be all excited. ‘Oh, he’s gonna go the full hour'”! “He won’t make it past the bridge.” [audience laughs] “The minute Jane Wiedlin starts singing, “Hush my darling,” he’ll hop off of you, he’ll check his texts in the crapper.” “He’ll never come back.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Extinguish all joy within you, and nothing’ll ever hurt you again.” [audience laughs] I just pitched the saddest Pixar movie in the… If they do a movie with the Safdie brothers, that’s gotta be their movie. Harvey Keitel is the elliptical. [audience laughing] Timothée Chalamet is the rebounder. [audience laughing] And Frances McDormand is the half-inflated exercise ball. [audience laughs] Went fucking crazy during the shutdown. My rock-bottom, psychologically, during the shutdown happened on the same day as my wife and daughter’s. We all hit crazy rock-bottom at the same time. Um, it was a weekday. We’re all in the house, staying inside. Doing our part. Stop the spread. My daughter’s in the kitchen, and out of nowhere, she says, “Hey, there’s a weird guy in our backyard.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat the fuck? I go running out, “What?” Looking out, “I don’t see anybody. You saw someone?” She goes, “Some weird guy just walked across our backyard and went around the back. He’s back there right now.” I’m like, “Oh shit!” We have cameras all over the property. I have an app on my phone. You click it and can look at what the camera sees. I’m waiting for it. I’m gonna go back and confront him. I just wanna know what I’m about to deal with. I don’t know what’s back there. What if it’s a lost hippie wanting someone to hacky-sack with him? “I’ll hacky-sack with you.” [audience laughing] Could be a maniac, nude, with a bucket of chicken on his dick, holding a sword. I don’t know what’s back… I just wanna be ready. [audience laughing] But the cameras aren’t loading, and I’m waiting for it. Goddamn it. And then my wife pushes past us, doesn’t say anything and goes striding across the back lawn. She’s got a white summer dress on flowing in the wind, barefoot. And she’s holding a pink, aluminum baseball bat. [audience laughing] And she has serious Manson girl energy coming off of her, like…\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Look at that hot, hippie chick that I wanna fuck and get murdered by.” “Yay.” [laughing] So, she… It takes me a second to realize what she’s doing, then I go clomping after her, in my flip-flops and cargo pants, but she’s already around the corner and she’s already laying into this guy. Before I can turn the corner, I hear her screaming at him, “Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my yard!” “I will fuck you up.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and applauding] So… I… I turned the corner. She’s in a stance. [audience laughs] Like Uma in Kill Bill, she’s ready to go. [audience laughs] The guy she’s yelling at, little scruffy looking, didn’t look crazy, didn’t look homeless, holding a cell phone, just looked a little off, and she’s screaming and yelling at him, “What the fuck are you doing here?” Now I’m gonna stop the story and tell you what was actually happening. There was something wrong with our air conditioner. I…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI called our contractor and said, “Can you send someone to the house to fix the AC?” Without telling us, he gave this guy our address and gate code and sent him to the house. So yes, massive misunderstanding. My wife is now screaming at him, and she’s just fucking… Just blazing Valkyrie, shrieking at the top of her lungs at this guy, “Who the fuck are you?” Now, to his discredit… [audience laughing] …when there is a blazing-eyed Valkyrie holding a vagina-colored piece of metal… [audience laughing] …threatening to kill you, answer in short, declarative sentences. [audience laughing] [applause] This guy… This guy was going, “Who’s anybody really, man? Like…” “Every day was… Oh, the wheel in the sky…” Oh, goddamn it. Now she’s got both hands on the bat. She’s gonna swing on the guy. And then he looks at me. And when he looks at me, that’s when he gets scared.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe started saying, “My name is Michael. Your guy Steve sent me here to figure…” And my wife’s like, “Oh my God, he didn’t tell us. I’m so sorry.” “Oh my God, I’m gonna call him right now.” “I’m… This was… This really got off on the wrong foot.” “How about you leave…” The guy was more than happy to leave. [audience laughs] I’m sure he was driving home going, “That poor bastard. Oh my God.” “I’m sure the sex is amazing but…” Um… [audience laughing] A lot of you hear the story and go, “That’s not very manly of you.” “You let your wife… God knows what could’ve happened!” I argue the opposite. [audience laughs] I say that our timing and placement made us a more effective home invasion deterrent. [audience laughs] ‘Cause remember he never got scared when she was screaming at him? He just kept going, “I…” You know why? He couldn’t process what he was seeing.\\n[audience laughs]\\nGorgeous Valkyrie, vagina-colored metal, screaming. Too much. Too fucking much. Couldn’t process it. And also, again, the energy she’s giving off is outer-space sex vixen about to murder you. [audience laughing] Can’t process it. You know what he could process? Me. Standing five feet behind her, ’cause the energy I was giving off was, “I can’t do nothing when she gets like this.” “I… I tried to get her to go to the nervous hospital, see?” “She said she’d burn the house down.” “She’s killed so many Amazon delivery drivers.” “I can’t dig no more holes in the desert. Please just run!” [audience laughing] I’m doing some poses that we can freeze for the Netflix save screen. A little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] [Patton chuckles]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThere’s gotta be… What if I did… What if I use… Here’s what I’m gonna do. Watch. Like this. [audience laughing and cheering] Now, look. That’s… That’s not a bit in the special, but if you’re watching Netflix, and that “coming up next,” you’re like, “Let’s watch a minute of that.” Like, “What the fuck is this?” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] I’m vaxxed and boosted. Yes, I am. Thank you. It shouldn’t… [cheering and applause] Thank you. But… That… Look. Thank you. It’s also sad that gets applause at this point, isn’t it? You get applause for taking the most basic care of your health? That’s like me going, “Folks, I wipe after I shit. Thank…” No. No, no. [cheering and applause] People. No. I’m no… I’m no hero now. It’s the lumberjacks who cut down the trees that make the toilet… Those are the heroes. [audience laughing] [man] Yeah! [chuckles] I assume there’s a lumberjack here. All right, um…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Patton chuckles] Or a really enthusiastic wiper. Um… [audience laughing] I got my vax right when the vax came out. Immediately. I didn’t jump the line. I didn’t use my privilege, but… I acted on some inside information, and I feel bad about this. This is how I did it. Uh… Right when the vaccine came out, I have a friend, lives out in Riverside. And he calls me and says, “I don’t know if I should tell you this, but, uh, out where I’m living, it’s MAGA country.” “No one is getting the vaccine.” “There’s a Rite Aid near me, a woman sitting at a table.” “Everyone that walks in she asks if they want it. No one will get it.” “They’re throwing crates of this shit out the back.” “If you drive out here, you will get a shot.” “Don’t even make an appointment.” So I drove out there. I walk in. There’s a woman at a table. I go, “Hi, excuse me. I’d like to get a vaccine.” She was like, “You would?” Like, she had no… [audience laughing] She had run out of Tolkien novels to read. Like, “Yeah. Let me get you set up.” Like, “Go stand over there.” While I’m waiting, my friend was right, everyone that walked in, “Would you like a vaccine?” “No, thank you.” And one guy gave her a, uh… “[scoffs] Yeah, no thanks.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nLike, “Yeah, nice try, Deep State. I think I’m gonna, uh…” “I think I’m gonna stay tracker-free for the time being if that’s all right.” “Hang on. Yeah. I’m at the Rite Aid again. Yeah.” “They tried to get a fucking track… Hang on. I’m losing you.” “There you are. Yeah, no. I’m off the grid, man. That’s…” “Right. I’ll call you later.” Got my shot. Got my second shot, then boosted twice. I’m fucking fine. In 1955, the polio vaccine came out. 1955. We were two years away from satellites. There were no satellites! And America could not have been more backward, racist, homophobic, sexist, and these non-satellite-having, racist dipshits lined the fuck up to get their fucking vaccine! [cheering and applause] What the fuck! [cheering and applause continues] “Give me that shot. I can’t police these water fountains from a wheelchair.” [audience laughing] “I can’t beat up queers inside an iron lung! Give me my science!” “What am I, a caveman?” [audience laughing] Now it’s the year 2022, which, first off, doesn’t sound like a real year, does it? [audience laughs] Doesn’t that sound made up? Like you’re watching a cheap science-fiction film, “In the year 2022…” “Oh, you’re just throwing numbers together. Jesus!” “Who wrote this shit?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s 2022. We have robots on Mars. They send us TikTok videos. [audience laughing] Half of the country’s like, “That needle’s got witch poison in it, I tells ya.” “You ain’t putting no witch poison in me.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “Keep your wizard jab away from me.” “I got to watch the video that the Mars robot sent to the world brain I keep it in my pocket.” [audience laughing] “But keep all that science away from me.” If that attitude had existed in 1955, the government would have had to do one of those PSAs, like a little cartoon dancing, hypodermic needle coming out, you know. [audience laughing] “Who do I gotta blow to cure polio?” Like little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] Yes. That’s right, jabby. Tell everyone about your benefits. [audience laughs] “My benefits? Your fucking legs work. How’s that for a benefit?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You medieval shitheads.” [audience laughing] It’s a different world now, man. It’s a different world. Isn’t it? Cruise ships? Oh, you’ll never see a cruise ship again. Kiss that goodbye. Our grandkids won’t know what a buffet is. Oh. [audience laughs] Fuck, Covid changed everything. First off, every cruise ship is booked up to the year 2026. People cannot wait to get aboard the plague barge and sail the bounding main. “Oh, let me die near a water slide!” [audience laughing] Not only are buffets gonna come back, they’re gonna come back with this weird, own-the-libs vengeance. Every one of them’s gonna have an agenda. “Come on down to Captain Covid’s Alpha Males Only buffet!” [audience laughing] “You the kind of left-wing soy boy that needs a sneeze guard over your clam chowder, or are you able to fuck your wife?” “Then come on down to Captain Covid’s…” [audience laughing] “You show us proof you ain’t been vaccinated, you get a free platter of room-temperature scallops.” [audience laughing] “That’s right.” [chuckles] Oh… I was listening to ’70s on 7 on the way here. Yeah, on my XM Sirius satellite dial. You like ’70s music? You hit number seven. All the ’70s music you can have, ’70s on 7. You like ’80s music? You hit number eight.\\n[audience laughs]\\n’80s on 8. Do you like ’90s music? Guess what you hit. Number nine! [audience laughing] Do you like ’40s music? Well, you don’t hit number four. You used to, ’40s on 4. Now, channel 71. ’40s Junction. You like ’50s music? Well, it’s channel 72. ’50s Gold. You like ’60s music? Seventy-three, ’60s Gold. Why did those three channels get moved to the outer rim of the XM Sirius universe? I will tell you why. Their listeners are dying. [audience laughing] ’40s, ’50s, ’60s. Those listeners are dropping like… The fucking ’40s channel has five listeners left. [audience laughing] Three World War II veterans and a couple of contrarian hipsters. That’s it. That’s all that’s left. “You know who’s punk rock? Artie Shaw.” Fuck off.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd we can laugh and enjoy it, but hey, during our lifetimes, ’70s, ’80s, ’90s will go marching up the dial. That’s how you can track how the generations are dying, by where they’re putting the stations. [audience laughing] Keep the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s easy. I hope when they do that, that they take a little time and give some consideration to the names the way they did for the ’40s channel, ’40s Junction, train station, evocative. I get it. Picture in my head. And then they just gave up. ’50s Gold, ’60s… Ah, who care… What? You couldn’t do “Poodle Skirts and Milkshakes”? You couldn’t do “Patchouli Oil and Love Beads,” or whatever? [audience laughing] Give the ’70s channel a name emblematic of the decade. You know, “Your Mother and I Are Separating Radio.” How about that? That’s good. Sure. [audience laughing] Yeah. “Giant Candles Everywhere For Some Reason Tunes.” [audience laughing] The ’80s could be “Trapper Keeper Tunes.” [audience cheering and applauding] And then the ’90s channel could just be… [groans] [audience laughing] [groaning] I don’t know… That was Abra Moore’s “Four-Leaf Clover” on… [groans]\\n[audience laughing]\\n[groans] [audience laughing] Hi. Do you live here in Denver, ma’am? I live in Colorado Springs. [Patton] You live in Colorado Springs? Nice. Thank you for making the drive. [woman] No problem. Okay. What do you… [laughing] Okay, glad I got that straight. It wasn’t a problem. Thank God. Okay. Guys, it wasn’t a problem. It’s cool. [audience laughing] [Patton chuckles] Do you work in Colorado Springs? What do you do? I’m a doctor. [Patton] You’re a doctor. Oh my God, a brainiac. All right, um… What kind of medicine do you practice? I’m a pediatric neurologist. Pediatric neurologist. Oh my God! [audience cheering] You’re like… [cheering and applause] You are serving your community. You are helping children. You have a positive job that you have a positive attitude towards. This is comedy death. I need to get off of you right now. There’s nothing here. [audience laughing] I need to talk to a meth cook or a divorcee. This is… [audience laughs] “I help children live.” [sliding beep] All right. Shit. [audience laughing] Is this, uh… Are you with her? You guys together? Is this the hubby? The husband. The husband. What do you do, sir? I’m a lawyer. [Patton] You’re a lawyer? Ah… [audience laughing] [kisses] Finally.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSome evil. [audience laughing and applauding] Oh God, if it’s some kind of positive community outreach law, I’m gonna fucking… What kind of law do you practice, sir? I prosecute juvenile sex crimes. You prosecute juvenile sex offenders. Well…\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhen you say juvenile sex offenders, do you mean people who commit sex offenses against juveniles, or juveniles who are sex offenders? Juveniles who are sex offenders. Juveniles who are sex offenders. Gotta be very careful with the phrasing. And when you say… And then what happens? Like, they get… Why am I…? What is this, a…? I gotta… Me sitting down was good for that one laugh. I’m not gonna do the rest of my show like, “So what do you do?” [audience laughing] What the hell am I doing?\\n[applause]\\nYou are prosecuting the juvenile sex offenders. Okay. And you are a neurological pediatrician. So a kid whose brain maybe isn’t working correctly, you help fix it. And the ones you can’t fix, he puts away, right? Is that how… [audience laughing] There we go. [audience laughing] There’s your next Marvel team-up. All right. So… [laughs]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat was cute and dark at the same time. Rare to find that. It’s like a goth girl holding a kitten. All right. [audience laughing] How about you? Do you live here in Denver?\\n[man] I do.\\nYou do? What do you do in Denver? Uh, I work in a bar and I’m a student. You work in a bar and you’re a student. Oh, it’s a 1980s Tom Hanks movie. All right. So…\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat are you studying right now? Uh, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. And then, by day, he patrols the Internet. At night, it’s Slippery Nipples for secretaries, right? [audience laughing] What, uh… So you’re a bartender, and so do you want to eventually work in cybersecurity? Obviously. [man] Yeah. And the bartending’s paying the bills. Paying for you to learn. What is the… What’s the scariest thing you’ve learned so far in terms of cybersecurity? How close are we to some huge hack attack where suddenly the ATMs don’t work and all of our porn searches are on the internet? When does that happen? [audience laughs] Um… Pretty much nothing is private. [Patton] Pretty much nothing is private. Well, we all know that at this point. That’s not… Oh my God, have you ever… Okay, when you were growing up, was there, like, some asshole that bullied you or was really shitty, and now that you’re learning your cybersecurity skills, you could go digging into this person’s life and just dis-fucking-mantle it if you wanted to?\\n[audience laughing]\\nHas that temptation ever crossed your head? Pretty frequently. Have you… Oh! Have you done searches of old bullies’ names and stuff like that? I’ve… I’ve chosen not to. You’ve chosen not to. [audience laughs] That is a very lawyerly response. That was… Did you catch that? [audience laughing] Oh, man. Is this the wife or girlfriend? Uh, yes. [Patton] Which one? [laughter] Girlfriend. [Patton] Girlfriend! Oh! And what do you do? I’m an educator. [Patton] You’re an educator. And what do you… Thank you. [cheering and applause] Wow. What, uh… What do you… What areas do you educate in? I help high schoolers, um, access free college credit. Help high schoolers access free college credit. Does the… That’s cool. Does the, um… Does the sleeve tattoo help break the ice when they’re like, “She’s cool”? “She’s all right.” Yep. That must help. [woman] It does, yeah. Do you go in with the sleeve tattoo visible? Or do they make you wear a long sleeve? I bust it all out. [Patton] You bust it all out, sit there… “Let’s get you some fucking credit while you look at The Gashlycrumb Tinies right there, man. There you go.” You got some ink too. How long you been going out? Three years. Four. Three or four years. Three or four years. [audience laughing] Mmm. Some cybersecurity, if you know what I’m saying. Ah, come on, people. Um…\\n[audience laughing]\\nAre you… Do you live together? Oh, nice! Are you gonna… She looks awesome in… And then he can get you, like, free credit card shit and everything. I mean, come on. [audience laughs] It’s a match made in heaven. Make it happen. Couldn’t he use his cybersecurity to get kids free college credit? Change their grades, get them into Harvard. There’s another fucking team-up. All right. [audience cheering and applauding] I have two superhero teams in the front row. Oh, hello sir. [audience laughing] Shorts in the front row. Ballsy. [audience laughing] That’s it. You have way more self-confidence than I will ever have. Do you live here in Denver? I do. [Patton] And what do you do in Denver? I work in Boulder, actually. You work in Boulder. Live in Denver, work in Boulder. What do you do in Boulder? I work for a grocery store. You work for a grocery store. With that facial hair? They’re cool with that or…? [laughter] What… I’m not gonna ask what grocery store. That’s weird. [man] I bet you can figure it out. Probably could. Hang on. What is your specific job at the grocery store? I’m a manager. You’re a manager at the grocery store. Do you manage the whole store or one department? Um… Yeah. [audience laughing] Yeah, part of it. Yeah. Part of it. The liquor section? What part do you, um…?\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou seem amazed at hearing that you’re working at a grocery store coming out of you. “I work at a grocery store! I…” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] And, uh, who are you here with? Is this your friend? There’s your friend. And where do you work? Uh, I work from home. You work from home. [man] In sales. In sales. I sell light bulbs. [Patton] You sell light bulbs. Are you asking me? You seem to be like, “I sell light…” You’re answering my questions like I’m a homicide cop. You’re like, “I-I sell light bulbs?” Like, it’s not… [audience laughing] You sell light bulbs from your home. I’m a lighting salesman. You’re a lighting salesman, so you stay in your house. You call people up or get on the internet with them? On the internet. On the internet. And you try to sell them light bulbs. Absolutely. Individuals or corporations? Both. [Patton] Both. That’s so fucking weird. [audience laughs] I just… I don’t know how… So you get on Zoom calls with them, and go, “Really quick, turn on all your lights.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“It’s pretty shitty, huh?” “Well, I’ve got a solution for you.” [laughing] [audience laughing] You’re not far. That’s so fucking interesting. Okay. You two are delightful, and you are not a superhero team. I’m sorry. [audience laughs] That is… I don’t know what the hell you are. There’s a guy who works at a Trader… Doesn’t quite know what he does there. Another guy gets on Zoom calls and sells light bulbs. I think you have a weird OnlyFans. You’re just covering for it now. You don’t really sell light bulbs. [man] It’s the DC Universe. Oh, DC Universe. Very… Oh… I’ll do the nerd shit, my friend. All right. [audience laughing] Don’t you dare! [audience laughing] That was a fun front row. Give them a round of applause. Thank you, guys. Wow. [cheering and applause] I love the flow of that. You know, doctor, lawyer, cybersecurity, educator, sort of groceries, light bulbs, I guess. I don’t know. [groans] [audience laughing] Perfectly paced. [kisses] [audience laughing] [sighs] You know what doesn’t age well? Woke. [audience laughs] It really doesn’t. I’m woke, I think. But you know what? I won’t be someday, and so will all of you.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBe woke. Be open-minded. Just don’t pat yourself on the back, ’cause it’ll bite you in the ass. Everyone getting cancelled now for not being woke was woke about something, they just couldn’t keep up with progress. Progress will always fucking steamroller you. I’m very pro-trans, very pro-gay marriage, gay rights, and pro-abor… No, no, no. No. No. [cheering and applause] That’s not… What I’m saying is that is going to blow up in my face someday. I’ll be doing comedy when I’m 70, and I will let slip something that I won’t be able to keep up with. I’ll be like, “I don’t think people should fuck their clones.” “Boo!” There’ll be some weird, like… [audience laughing] “No wait, I’m pro-trans.” “Fuck you, clone hater!” [audience laughing] “No, I’m totally progressive!” #Stopclonehate, then I gotta… Then I’ll double down. “When I grew up, you didn’t jerk off in a test tube and fuck whatever came out of it! If that makes me the bad guy, I’m sorry!”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Boo!” [Patton chuckles] By the way, that’s how you know if you’re a… uh, if you’re an oppressed minority, or, you know, a fringe group that used to be shit on, and now you know that you’ve made it when straight, white people start asking you if jokes are okay. That’s when you know… The trans community really broke through because all of a sudden, straight, white people’ll be like, “Is this okay?” “Does this joke work? Is that okay?” You know. But either way, that means in the future, straight, white people are gonna be the minority, then they’re gonna have assholes like, “Hey, I’m doing a joke about a straight, white dude, and, um, I have him bowling. Is that okay? You guys bowl, right? Like that’s…” [audience laughing] “It’s not offensive?” “He’s listening to Limp Bizkit, ‘ironically, ‘ okay?”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\n“It’s ironic. I’m doing it ironically.” [Patton chuckles] Goddamn, these last six years. Holy shit. I was in such a panic in 2016, then all the subsequent years, “What the hell’s going on? Oh my God. Is America coming to an end?” No. You know what? It isn’t. It’s bad right now, but everything that’s happening is supposed to be happening right now. Do you know what 2016 was? It was the boomers’ last temper tantrum.\\n[audience cheering]\\nThat’s what that was. [cheering and applause] The boomers’ last temper tantrum. Every time a generation gets old, they panic because death is scary and gross, and they put someone shitty in the White House before they go. This has happened before. The greatest generation… The greatest generation, oh my God, fought the Nazis, saved the world from tyranny, came back, built the suburbs, raised the baby boomers, then they started getting old. Hair turned gray, dick didn’t work anymore, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies. They panicked. Now it’s the late ’70s. Punk music, they don’t know what’s going on. “Fuck this.” “Put the old cowboy movie actor in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here, goddamn it!” [applause] Then the baby boomers grew up. Think of the baby boomers. They were on the cutting edge of sex, rock and roll, rebellion… They owned youth, and then they got fucking old. [audience laughing] And their hair got gray, and their dick stopped working, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies, fucking Gen X and Gen Z making fun of them on Twitter and TikTok. All this hip-hop music they don’t understand. Now they’re, “Oh my God, I’m about to die. What the fuck is going on?” “Put the racist game show host in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here!” [laughter and applause] I’m Gen X. Well, our temper tantrum is going to be beyond ugly. [audience laughing] When we start getting old, our dicks stop working, our hair goes gray, God knows who we’re gonna put in the White House. It’s gonna be either Eddie Vedder or Janeane Garofalo. One of those two. I don’t know. [cheering and applause] Look. I love those guys. Janeane would be a horrible president. [audience laughs] I’ve known her since the ’90s. I love her. She would tell you that herself. Janeane, you should be president. “I’m not doing that shit.” Oh my God, wait a minute. That’s how she’ll win. [audience laughs] Think of how Gen X thinks. Like, “That’s exactly the attitude we need.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect. “No, I’m serious. I’m not doing it.” Yeah, we know, yes. [audience laughing] She’ll blow off a debate. She won’t campaign. She won’t show up to her own inauguration. Yes, that’ll be awesome. We’ll love her even more. CNN will have a ticker on the bottom of the screen, like, “Day 312 of the president not showing up.” [audience laughing] It’ll cut to her in some coffee shop. “I told you I wasn’t gonna run.” [audience laughing] And then we’ll die, and we won’t be here to see what Gen Z puts in the White House. President Logan Paul. I don’t… Look. I don’t know. [audience groaning] President Joe Rogan. [audience groaning] He would… People, listen to me. I’ve also… I’ve known Joe since the ’90s. He is a sweet guy. He has gone off the rails. You know why? ‘Cause someone gave him a hundred million dollars. [audience laughs] That would drive anybody… He’s actually handling it better than I would. [audience laughs] If I had a fucking podcast about knitting and someone gave me a hundred million, I would fuck yarn on my podcast! [audience laughing] And Joe would be like, “Patton went fucking nuts. Oh my God.” [Patton chuckles] Aging isn’t bad if you don’t take it personally. That’s the key, you know. Treat it like it’s a… Pretend you’re Jeff Goldblum in The Fly, and you’re watching all this weird shit happen. You’re like, “Oh my!” Get a leather-bound notebook. Take notes, you know, late at night, like… “Oh. My farts smell like old books.” “That’s… Hmm.” [audience laughing] “But I’m not eating old books. This…” “This calls for further examination.” [audience laughing] “Day 17. Takes longer to stop peeing than it does to pee.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s coming for all of us. I’m gonna leave you with this story about my, uh… Another breakdown that I had. Foot, all of it, it’s all coming apart. But you know what? We’re living in the 21st century and it’s okay. Always keep that in mind. Last year, last November, I had to have some minor surgery, right? And I’m gonna tell you the story. I’m gonna use a little AP English zhoosh to keep it from being horrifying, ’cause it is. I had to have some minor surgery, the kind of surgery that, um, I’ll put it this way, men my age who sit down a lot have to have. See where I’m going? So… And I’m worried. Still Covid. “Oh my God, what if I get an infection?” But I forgot I live in the 21st century. I have all these advantages in the plus column. On the day of the operation, I summoned a car with my phone. The car came. The guy was masked. I was masked. Car was clean, took me to the hospital. Doctor met me, showed me all the cleanliness protocols they had. He said, “This surgery, we’ve refined it.” “It only takes an hour. You’ll be out for an hour.” “You’ll go home today.” He put me under. I wake up an hour later. Oh my God, I’m fine. He goes, “You are fine.” “Here are some cutting-edge painkillers to help you with your recovery.” “You won’t feel a thing.” “Now take out your phone and summon another car.” “You live in the 21st century.” And I did, and the car took me home. And when I got home, I had a device onto which I could call, from the air, movies, books, television shows, music to entertain me while I recovered. Twenty-first century. When I left the hospital, the doctor said, “There’s a certain bodily function, that you’re used to doing every day.” “And for the next few days, you’re not gonna do it.” [audience laughs] “And then, after three or four days, all of a sudden, you will do it.” [audience laughing] “But the first time you do it, it will be doing you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“There’s no shame in it.” “It’s gonna happen, part of the recovery.” “Go heal in peace.” I go home. First day, I watch movies. I read books on my iPad. I go to sleep. Nothing happens. Next day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. Nothing happens. Third day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. 3:30 in the morning. [audience laughing] It happens. But I wake up as it’s happening and I can feel it coming. I’m half a second ahead of it. Oh my goodness, it’s not gonna be a disaster. I hop out of bed. Everything’s okay. I make it across the bedroom floor. I get into the bathroom. I’m ten feet away from the toilet. I’m gonna make it. [sings suspenseful melody] Boom! No.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI had managed to get my underwear and sweatpants off. [audience laughing] Which made things ten times worse. [audience laughing] Because now, our pristine white-tile bathroom… [audience laughing] …was decorated for autumn. How about that, huh? Yeah. [audience laughing] Happy Thanksgiving. So… [audience laughing] I’m standing there going, “Oh my God, I’ve got two choices. I can either clean myself off, or risk my wife coming in and seeing this disaster, which she doesn’t deserve.” So, I do the second choice. I clean up everything first. I get a bunch of towels. I get everything all cleaned up in a big, gross wad. I gotta take off all my clothes, including my shirt. I’d ruined my shirt. [audience laughing] Physics. So…\\n[audience laughing]\\nTake the whole wad down to the… And I’m nude now. Go down to the kitchen with this big wad of horror, take the bag out of the can, put this in the bag. Now, four in the morning, I gotta walk to the end of my driveway where the trash cans are. Get the thing open. Drop it. And I just stand there. [audience laughing] Nude. [audience laughing] 4:00 in the morning. And I just looked at the moon. [audience laughing] Like, hours ago, I was in the 21st century… [audience laughing] …with access to cutting-edge technology, medicine, transportation. And now, just a mere couple of hours later, I had been revealed as the naked ape I always was.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[applause]\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThe naked, shit-covered ape that’s inside all of us. And I actually had a weird moment of peace, ’cause it was so awful, and I’m just like, “You know what? I’m actually as far away from the 21st century as I could possibly be right now.” “I’m actually closer to my Neanderthal forebears.” “There’s something weirdly cleansing about this.” And I had that feeling for, like, ten seconds. That’s when I remembered all my neighbors have ring cameras on their doors.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo everybody got their Christmas card that year.\\nThank you so much, Denver!\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThank you!

From childhood memories of watching Goodness Gracious Me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes, class, and multiculturalism in the UK, Shah blends humor and poignant storytelling. The show covers themes of identity, family sacrifice, love, and the generational impact of immigration, all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary.\\n* * *\\n[man] In January 1998, a seven-year-old boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London. Three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the BBC. Now, the boy’s grandparents had had tough lives, right? The sort of lives that clad you in an armour, and it’s the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape. But for the next half hour, the boy and his family watched episode one of Goodness Gracious Me, and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember. And watching Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal, Nina Wadia and Kulvinder Ghir on television, the boy thought, “Wait, we can do that?! I didn’t know we could do that.” “But if we get to do that, then I wanna do that,” because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound I’ve ever heard in my entire life. Over 25 years later, would you please welcome to the stage Mr Ahir Shah.\\nHello! Hello!\\nHello. Hello. Hello. Hello.\\nGood evening, London. Are we well?\\n[cheering and applause] Fantastic, fantastic. Lovely to have you here. Lovely to have you in such fine voice. Hello! Uh, my name is Ahir Shah. That is my name, by the way, right? I didn’t used to need to clarify this, until a few years ago, I was doing this gig in Switzerland… I was doing a gig in Switzerland, and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country, right? I was the British entrant. Very modern.\\nRight? And…\\n[laughter] There was one comedian I was particularly excited to meet ’cause this guy’s name was Ali Al Sayed. Now, Ali is a stand-up comedian from the United Arab Emirates, of all places, right? I’d never met anyone from the United Arab Emirates, let alone a comedian from the United Arab Emirates. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t think they had comedians in the United Arab Emirates. I assumed he’d just be walking onstage being like, “What’s the deal with unspeakable oil wealth?”\\n[laughter]\\nHe’s a very nice man, a very funny man. After the show, all the comedians, we’re all backstage hanging out. We’re all having a laugh, having a drink. Not Ali, obviously. Right, and… We get to talking, and he says to me, “Like, uh, listen, bro.” “We’re friends now. I can ask you a question.” “You’re not gonna get offended.” I’m like, “Listen, brother.” “You’re from Dubai. I’m of South Asian origin.” “As long as the question you have for me is not, ‘Do you want a job on a construction site?'”\\n[laughter]\\nIndustrialised slavery. “You can ask me whatever the hell you like.” He’s like, “Nothing like that. I was just wondering.” “When did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name Ahir Shah?” Right? I was like, “To be honest, I don’t remember, but it was probably 28th December 1990 when I plopped out of Mrs Shah, and she and Mr Shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy Ahir.” “I think that’s about when I started going by Ahir Shah.” He’s like, “Right, right, okay.” “One thing you should know, in case you’re ever in my neck of the woods, is that in Arabic, your name means Prostitute King!”\\nHe wasn’t even fucking with me. Ahir Shah is “prostitute king” in Arabic. There are several reasons I didn’t think my career would go stratospheric in Saudi. Humble enough to know that I don’t have the best bone-saw material on the circuit. That’s Romesh, and fair enough. Right, but, uh… I put this to the back of my mind for several years, as you would, until, uh, November 2022. I was in Egypt doing some work around the COP climate conference. They speak Arabic in Egypt, and I don’t know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as “Monarch of all Pimps”?\\nReally changes the vibe in a lobby, in my experience. They think you’re selling something very different to what you are. Anyway, that’s me, then. Ahir Shah. Prostitute King to my friends. Mr Shah to you, and, uh… It’s been a while since I’ve done a big show like this. A lot’s changed in the world, in my life. A lot’s changed in my life. I’m now very much in my thirties now. That’s exciting. Shit started falling apart way younger than I was led to believe, by the way. I thought I had another good decade left in me. As it stands, everything’s already just crumbling. My knees are already fucked. Absolutely no idea what’s going on there. I’m trying desperately to get a referral from my GP, right… Sorry, for younger people… Right, um, a GP… Right… So a GP was a service where, like…\\nYoung fellow. How old are you, mate?\\nTwenty-two. Twenty-two. So you might remember but in the same way you remember iPods. You never had one, but you’re vaguely aware they existed. Okay, so basically, like, a GP was this, like… Right, imagine you’re a bit poorly. Not super poorly but a bit poorly. What would happen was there was this number you called, and someone answered, right, and, uh… Not even necessarily at eight in the morning. Any time during business hours. Very forthcoming. Uh, so you’d call them, and you’d be like, “Oh, I’m a bit poorly,” and they’d be like, “Ah, cool. Come see us, soon.”\\nRight? And so a couple of days, days, a couple of days later, what would happen was you went over to this… Right. It looked like a semi-detached house. It wasn’t. That was the first trick they played. It’s like a sphinx’s riddle. Past that, you were golden. You’d arrive, like, 10, 15 minutes early. You’re a conscientious person. And you’d sit in a sort of, uh, waiting room, and after about 10, 15 minutes, someone would call your name, and you’d go to a separate, smaller room, and there would just be one guy in there, and he would be like… I mean, he would, right? ‘Cause we’ve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard. Right? And you’d tell this person what sort of poorly that you were, and this was a very well-educated person, so you could just be fixed then and there, but occasionally, it’d be a slightly more complex health need, and you’d get a referral to a hospital, right? Sorry. Right. A hospital. Now… Have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends? Right? That is a building known as a “hospital”.\\nFunny word, isn’t it? Interesting thing. You were born in one. You’ll die in one. Between then, you’re fucked. Sorry. Right, uh, basically that… I’m obviously being slightly disingenuous. There are quite a lot of them. Generally speaking, they were all either built or done up when the prime minister’s name was either Attlee, Wilson, or Blair. Not sure why. Not sure why! It’s just a coincidence, isn’t it? What possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things? Fourteen fucking years! Fourteen wasted fucking years! Like, not entirely wasted, obviously. There have been some genuine achievements of Conservative government. I mean that entirely sincerely, by the way. My favourite of which is, like… Basically, it’s funny. If you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data, over the last 14 years, the Tories so successfully decarbonised the British economy and energy mix, including all imported emissions, that if the countries responsible for the lion’s share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as we’ve been over the last 14 years, global warming basically wouldn’t be a thing. The Tories did that. They did it on purpose. It is spectacularly impressive, and they can’t admit it ’cause they think it sounds gay. Other than that, it’s slim pickings out there. Really is. Genuinely. It’s worse than it’s been my entire adult life, for sure. Listen, the vibes are awful out there. We’re genuinely skint, as a collective, in a way that we weren’t in 2010 ’cause, basically, in 2010, the Conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the British economy and society. That they then spent the next 14 years ensuring were true. Right, and… Is it… We need an election, yeah. We need an election. At this stage, I would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of one-man dictatorial rule, provided that the man in question was Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, right?\\n[whooping and applause]\\nI love that guy! I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn much.\\nDo you sign up to his email?\\nOh yeah. You do? You’re a good citizen. Well done, sir. If you do not sign up for it, do your bit for your country. That man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink. Right. I love Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, so goddamn… So, for the uninitiated, Martin Lewis, he’s a money-saving expert, and he runs this website called MoneySavingExpert.com, and you get a weekly email, and it’s about money saving and the expertise therein, right? And, um, basically, Martin Lewis, the Money Saving Expert, he set up his business for £80, right? Eight-zero. That’s all it cost. He is now worth 100 million, right? Isn’t that amazing? He gives a lot away to things like Citizen’s Advice ’cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge. I love that for Martin Lewis. I love that Martin Lewis is rich. Right? Here’s the thing, right? The reason I love it is that Martin Lewis is basically the only person I can think of who’s got properly rich from helping. Do you know what I mean? Take a second to dwell on how rare that is, broadly speaking. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping, is there? We all know that. There’s money in hindering, for sure. Right? There’s no money in helping. Right? When’s the last time any of you were walking down the street and went, “Oh my god, a Lamborghini! Who does that belong to?” And someone’s like, “The lollipop lady.” Right? It doesn’t happen. ‘Cause there’s no money in helping unless you’re Martin Lewis. Because that man is rich as balls, and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like, “Pizza Express. 2 for 1 on Wednesday.” “Dough balls are on me. Don’t worry about it.”\\nIt’s gonna take more than Martin Lewis to save us now, the state that we’re in. It’s really bad out there. And it’s weird for me because at the same time as the country I love is so visibly on its knees, I am personally happier than I have ever been in my entire life. And the two things are entirely unconnected, but still, feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful. Do you know what I mean? I’ve not done it on purpose, but it’s like having Chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral. The reason, ladies and gentlemen, that I am happier than I have ever been is that in October of last year, I got married. Yeah. Honestly, she’s the single best thing ever to happen to me. I love her with all my heart. She’s a civil servant. I’m in it for the pension. You have to understand I’m a self-employed man. Before I met her, my retirement plan was just to not live that long. Whereas now, my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day I die. Right? That’ll be a new personal best, mate. In this economy, I’ll try anything, right? I’d always known that I wanted to get married eventually. I guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well. I don’t know what to tell you. In Asian families, you get married, you stay married. It’s just what happens. Some of you may know this from your own families, maybe friends’ families. You might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the case, so I’ll give you the best example I have. I started doing stand-up comedy when I was a teenager, right? When I was about 17 years old, I was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the Hackney Empire theatre in East London. That’s a very big theatre. 1500 people. Some of you may well have been. It’s the coolest thing that had ever happened to me. I was on in the first section, so I invited my mum, my dad and my sister to come watch, and they saved me a seat so I could watch in the second section. And the reason I was invited in the first place is that the Hackney Empire were putting on an evening of British Asian stand-up, and I, as the new kid on the block, they were like, “Let’s give little Ahir a go.”\\nThat’s nice, isn’t it? And so the whole audience, sold-out show, 1500 people, all British Asian. All of the performers, British Asian, apart from… right… about two hours before the show started, one of the acts suddenly had to drop out. Now, this is the noughties. It’s not like nowadays where everyone’s got email on their phones. They had to ring around, try and find a replacement. A replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian Joe Bor. Right? Now, Joe is a very nice man. He’s a very funny man. What Joe is not is a British Asian man. Right? What Joe is is a Jewish man. Clearly, with two hours on the clock, one of the organisers was like, “Fuck! I…” [muttering] “I think Jews are basically Asian. I…”\\nListen, I’m not saying there aren’t similarities between the communities. My best mate’s Jewish. We’ve been mates since we were 14 years old, and it’s ’cause the first time we met, he told me about his mum, and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadn’t thought of yet. There’s one crucial difference between the communities, as my friend the comedian Joe Bor found out to his dismay that evening. Because my friend the comedian Joe Bor walked onstage in front of 1500 brown faces and opened with the line, “My parents are divorced.” “Gimme a cheer if your parents are divorced.”\\nFucking nothing! Not a single sound from 1,500 people. I will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my 17-year-old ear, “Bless him. He has no idea who he’s talking to.”\\nSo what happens in Asian families, for better or for worse, you get married, you stay married. I come from a very long line of very long-married people. Uh, my parents met at a mutual friend’s birthday party in India in 1979. Fell in love at first sight. My dad proposed that night. They have been married for almost 45 years. Right? Um… By the standards of my mum’s family, by the way, my parents had had quite an extensive courtship, uh, prior to that. I mean, like, well, her parents, my maternal grandparents, Nanaji and Nanima, I mean, the first conversation they had with one another, just, like, one-on-one, was on the night, like, several hours after they were already married, right? It’s 1955 in India. It was arranged. I don’t know what to tell you. Like, they weren’t complete strangers to one another. That would be silly. It’s, like, the families had exchanged a photograph. Uh… Right? And, um… these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them. Imagine getting shown that when you’re, like, 19, 20.\\n“Is this who you’d like to marry forever?”\\n“Oh yeah, I guess.”\\nThen, in the end, very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young. It’s so funny talking about this in front of liberal London audiences. Like, it’s just like, you all know that outwardly you have to be like, “Oh.” “The mysteries of the East.” Uh… “A rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our own.”\\nInternally, you’re all just thinking, “That’s fucking barbaric.”\\n“The thing is, that’s fucking barbaric, sorry.” “You mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens, and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information, and within a matter of days, they were in bed together?” “That is fucking disgusting.” “We would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary, enlightened Western…”\\n[laughter and applause]\\nSorry, just because you’ve decided to do it via algorithm, not “old woman in your village”, does not make it less arranged, right? All you’ve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable, all right? My wife and I obviously had a far more conventional relationship, uh, prior to getting engaged, meeting in this country and whatnot. It took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question, as they say, mate. We were going out five weeks, and I asked her to marry me. Um… I get shit done. There’s no point pissing about if you know you know. So just get it… get it done. No point leaving stuff on your to-do list for six months. Things are worth doing quickly and well. It’s the single best decision I ever made. Absolutely no downside. Admittedly, we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because, like, our tenancy agreements didn’t… Spent half my life on a fucking bus. Then, eventually, obviously, we were able to finally move in together, but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in London joining households, so now, we rent one roof that contains two copies of every Ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownership. [chuckles] I love my Ottolenghi books though. Not giving those up, even for a house. Might need the spares. Love my Ottolenghi books. Hey, mate, you got an Ottolenghi book?\\nAh yeah, I love it.\\nYeah? That’s the sort of thing you can afford when you get the Martin Lewis email. Love my Ottolenghi books.\\n“For this recipe, you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a Persian widow.”\\n“Or, if they don’t have that in a shop near you, just any lime.”\\nThe thing is, you think it’s bullshit, but I got some of the widow limes, and you can taste the grief. It’s good stuff, actually. The salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour. I think that, shy of having children with someone, I think getting engaged, getting married, it’s like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on the future. Just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say, “Our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of them.”\\nThat’s an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel, right? At the same time as it feels like we’re embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime, it feels like the country around us has just given up. You know what I mean? It’s very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders, isn’t it? It is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country. Right? That’s weird enough for me as we’re beginning this optimistic journey, but it’s doubly weird when I think about the fact that if I were able to get into a time machine and travel to 1964, when my grandfather, younger than I am now, became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores, and I would just explain the present to him, he would not believe me because he would think I was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress. So that’s really what I’m trying to do. To take a step back, view things through a wider lens, a generational lens, get some perspective, not be so blinkered, try not to lose the wood for the trees. ‘Cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the British Indian community. I think that’s a very relevant story to the past, present and future of this country, right? British Indians are, by a very long margin, the largest minority-ethnic group in this country. Hindus, again we’re talking about millions upon millions… None of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate Nish. Right? And… The story of the Indian community in this country, by and large, starts, as it did for my family, in the 1960s and has ended up, in the 2020s, with us now running everything?\\n“Rishi bhai did it!”\\n“Rishi bhai did it! Never thought I’d live to see the day that Rishi bhai did it.”\\n“Got that big house in the middle of town now, baby.”\\n“Rishi bhai did it!”\\nListen, politically, I’m furious. Racially, thrilled. Ah! Are you kidding me? On an ethnic level, couldn’t be happier for him and his family. Increasingly worried about mine. Very much how I used to feel every time I saw Suella Aunty on the television. “Jesus Christ, calm down, Suella Aunty. You’re gonna get us both killed.”\\nRight, uh… I’m gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit. Obviously, I’ve got to be relatively careful what I say about him because we can all agree there’s about a 70% chance that a decade from now, I will play him in a Channel 4 drama. Right, right… Not gonna burn a bridge before I’ve even crossed it. Are you kidding me? I need that money. I just wish that I could get across, like, how wild that day was, right? I… A British Indian, devout Hindu, son of immigrants, became prime minister of Britain on Diwali. That was a very difficult day in the family WhatsApp for me. Get the family WhatsApp up on my phone. Yes, it’s called the Asian Network. See “Dad is typing…” Wait for the inevitable. “Ahir, have you seen what Mr Sunak’s son has done today?” “Still, Ahir, you enjoy mocking your week. I’m sure that’s nice for you.”\\nI’m glad the shine’s come off him now. Everyone knows he’s not really up to it. At the beginning, you all acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. At the beginning, everyone acted like he was the perfect Indian boy. It’s ’cause you just go off the CV on paper. Right? You don’t know what I know. What does it say on the CV? Fucking anyone could’ve done that. What? Piece of piss. Who cares? What? All right, fair enough. What’s the guy done? Fair enough. Does well at school. Gets into Oxford. Does well at Oxford. Gets into Stanford. Does well at Stanford. Starts working in finance. Becomes a multi-multimillionaire in his own right in his twenties, largely through executing positions as a big short in 2007-2008 that makes him rich enough that he’d never have to work again. No one even reflects on that ’cause at Stanford, he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine Indian billionaire, who’s a very successful businesswoman in her own right. They move to the United Kingdom where he becomes an MP at an obscenely young age, Chancellor at an obscenely young age, during one of the worst financial crises this country’s experienced, then prime minister, at an obscenely young age, of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors, leading to complex migratory patterns, in his family’s case, via East Africa, landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith, and everyone acts like he’s the perfect Indian boy. Feel free to look this up. It is genuinely true. Rishi Sunak never made his school cricket team. I was captain of mine.\\n[cheering and applause]\\n\\n\\n\\nThat’s right! That is right! Any Indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me. All right? Know what I mean?\\n“Who cares about Rishi Sunak? I want Ahir Tendulkar. Mmm.”\\n“Hearing a lot about Number Ten. Should be batting at number four.”\\n“That’s classy.”\\nHis family came here in the ’60s too. Like, I… I think about that sometimes. Getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in Bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then, not only would this be the case, but I think the bit that he’d struggle with the most is that it’s not a thing. Do you know what I mean? The news was just like, “And the prime minister, Rishi Sunak,” and everyone’s like, “Yeah, that makes sense.”\\nIt is remarkable how unremarkable it is, right? That’s a thing that’s worth reflecting upon. Listen, I’ll always talk about the things we do badly as a country. I think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country. And I do think that when we’re at our best, Britain stands basically alone, certainly in Europe, probably in the world, as an example of what a properly successful multiethnic, multicultural democracy can look like in practice in the 21st century. That’s something that is worth discussing. It’s why I hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment, when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes. It’s why I can’t stand it when people on my own “team”, right? I don’t like teams in the first place, but listen. I voted remain, but whenever people are like, “It was only the European Union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency to…”\\nFuck off! Anyone else in the room ever been to continental Europe while not white? It’s not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy. Genuinely. A couple of years ago, I had to go to this wedding in France. I genuinely… The way people were… I kept asking people I was with… Like, I thought I had something on me. Turns out I did! Gonna get an Algerian president of France anytime soon, or reckon the fash’ll get there first? Same question for Germany, you know? Listen, I think that Britain stands basically alone in this. That’s worth reflecting on, right? I remember when I was 20 years old, walking across the Meadows on the south side of Edinburgh with my friend the Indian American comedian Hari Kondabolu, right? I said to him, “Hari bhai…“\\nI think that when you’re part of any sort of visible minority, whatever that minority might be, what you fundamentally want in life, it’s not necessarily different treatment or special treatment. Rather, it is the ability, eventually, to get to go without saying. To be part of what is. Just to, sort of, get to be normal. I think if you get to be normal 24-7, you probably don’t realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time. And does political representation get us there in and of itself? Of course it doesn’t, right? We know this for a fact. Rishi Sunak, not even the first PM from a minority-ethnic background. First, way back in the 19th century, Benjamin Disraeli, also a Tory, right? Would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary Britain? That would be a fucking stupid thing to say. But maybe these things are indicative of the fact that, in societies, we can, over time, move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying, until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone, which is where it should’ve been in the first fuckin’ place. I have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes. I have been to many countries, cities, continents doing this, and I can comfortably say that Britain is, yes, as the cliché goes, “the least racist country in the world”.\\nIt just says a shitload more about the world than about Britain. Right? And please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point. I think the guy’s a fucking appalling prime minister. He’s, like, genuinely terrible, and no one voted for any of this. It is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment. I do not agree with his politics, but… By the way, that’s when you know that something historic’s happened. People use phrases like, “I may not agree with the politics, but…” [emphatically] No one felt the need with David Cameron. It’s just nice for someone like that to get a girl, isn’t it? Right, but Sunak and Cameron are basically the same guy ’cause they went to fancy school. That’s what explains it. Fancy school, and fancy school runs the country. That is not the school that I think about when I think about the prime minister. The school that I think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away. In April 1919, an event occurred in Amritsar, Punjab, at the time British India, that is now known to history as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre. This is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians, peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very, very small area, and tens of thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians, at least 379 of whom were murdered, probably many more, though we’ll never know the true total, and thousands more had life-defining injuries thereafter. It is one of the worst and most well-documented cases of colonial atrocities of British rule in India. I’ve known about that a very long time. What I did not know about, until an investigation in The Times last year, was that subsequent to the massacre in Amritsar, there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding Amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings, including one that happened in a place called Gujranwala, right? Now, Gujranwala, it’s about 100 miles away from Amritsar. It’s a border town in contemporary Pakistan. And in Gujranwala, again, thousands of rounds of machine-gun fire were let out at entirely unarmed… just farmers tilling their fields. And over the course of two days, ten bombs were dropped, including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of “This is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you, so don’t you even think about trying to fuck with us.”\\nOne of the survivors of the massacre in Gujranwala was a two-year-old boy named Ramdas. Ramdas’s grandson is, at time of recording, prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\nYeah.\\n[applause] When… when I think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations, I think about the school in Gujranwala rather more than I think about Winchester College. A punchline would feel distasteful.\\n[laughter]\\nRight? Obviously, I wasn’t alive at the time, but I reckon the way I feel’s basically how a lot of women felt about Margaret Thatcher in 1979. You don’t need to agree with someone’s politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself, and that’s the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow. And you can’t deny that it works. You can’t deny that it… Listen. We’ve now had enough white-lady prime ministers that they’re allowed to be instantly shit! That is a staggering achievement for equality in this country. Are you kidding me? Maggie and Theresa walked so Liz could fly. Liz Truss, actually very important from a representational standpoint as well. Uh, I mean that entirely sincerely too. Think about how many prime ministers there must’ve been over however long it’s been. Did you know that Liz Truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school? Isn’t that mad, right? Like, 94% of children go to a regular comprehensive school. I went to a regular comprehensive school. I believe 94% of prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school. Admittedly, she wasn’t a great advert for us. Right? “I may not agree with her politics, but…”\\nIn case you’re trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent you’re currently enjoying… Uh, well, uh… What ended up happening there was I went to my local comp in Wembley, North West London. I had a wonderful time there, but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other. Very thoughtful of them. Subsequent to that, I ended up going to the University of Cambridge, so I became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman. Uh, uh… A few years ago, I was doing a TV record in Glasgow, and afterwards, I was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian Jamali Maddix. I was there with Jamali, smoking, making small talk.\\nHe went, “You went private school, yeah?” I’m like, “Oh no, I didn’t.” “What?”\\nSo I talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood, and he just looked at me and went, “Hang on, bruv, are you from ends?”\\n[posher accent] “Well, Jamali, one supposes one was.”\\nI’m not gonna do it down. I grew up in a wonderful place. I went to a wonderful school. I hate when people do that down. I… genuinely, it was a really good school. If you avoided gang violence, cousin marriage, it was Ofsted Good. Like, it was a great environment. All the families, by and large like mine. First-, second-generation immigrants. Parents may not have had a lot to give. What they had was the most important. An insistence that education is the best way onward, upward, outward. I think if you’ve got 100 grand, that’s a better thing to give to a child. And blessed with really great teachers. I’ll tell you about one of my favourites, Miss Lewis. Now, Miss Lewis, I think she had previously taught at a private school. I don’t know, but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead. Maybe thought that was unfair, right? And so she set up, off her own initiative, like all great teachers do, off her own bat, she set up, for a couple of years, an additional, optional Latin class, of all things. And I, as you can probably imagine, was heavily involved. This is what I mean about the transformative power of education. You could change everything for young people in an instant. I still remember, like it was yesterday, the first time I walked into that gleaming Portakabin bestowed on us by New Labour, and I sat down, and I opened these textbooks that contained these things that I’d never even conceived of before. I was just there being like, “Oh my God, it’s true!” “Caecilius est in horto!”\\nDo you know what I mean, right? Led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school, which was one time, at the end of term, my boys and I were gonna go cinema ’cause you get a half day. The way that you go to the cinema, you get the 182 from Brent Town Hall. So we were walking to the bus stop, and on the way to the bus stop, there’s this blind alley, right? And a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit, until one of them just stopped all of the others by going, “Guys, Ahir’s safe, yeah? I know him from Latin.”\\nI sincerely believe I am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of Latin class. Uh… [chuckles] Nathaniel, gratias tibi. It’s a great environment to grow up in, you know? Not much cash but a lot of ambition. I think that’s a good way around to have it, generally speaking. And realistic ambition as well. The families just had realistic ambitions. The sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on. The idea that if everyone does their bit, works hard, the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did. That is a reasonable ambition. Parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children. Right, now this is not an unreasonable ambition. I know all about unreasonable ambition. You don’t need to tell me about… I remember once, when I was at uni, entirely unironically telling my mate Ali that by the time I was in my thirties, I wanted to be GQ magazine’s World’s Best Dressed Man. Right? I am now in my thirties and will settle for “Dressed Man”.\\n[chuckles] And that’s a stretch most days. Listen, we all know, fundamentally, that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment. I think that the part that we’ve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice. Now, I might not know much about generational investment yet, but I feel like, through example, I at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school, I would go to my grandparents’ house in Alperton, North West London, and I would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of Nanaji and Nanima. Now, quick note on language. I speak another language. It’s called Gujarati. “Nanaji” just means your mum’s dad. You have different words for both sides of the family. So maternal grandfather, that’s nanaji. As you can imagine, I write a lot of stuff on my computer. My computer refuses to accept the existence of the word “nanaji” and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word “Navajo”. Which has led to three instances where I, alone at home, have yelled at a computer screen, “Wrong sort of Indian!”\\nNow, Nanaji was the first member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties in 1964. He is probably the reason that I was born here in the first place. He is the reason for so much. Even though he died a fair while ago now, he’s probably the largest part of the reason why I ended up sounding like this, right? When he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country, he said to the children, including my mother, “Listen, when you’re outside, you’re not allowed to speak to one another in Gujarati any more.” “You live somewhere called England now, so you need to learn how to speak like proper little Englishmen and women.” “And then if you learn how to do that, maybe one day, they’ll learn how to accept you.”\\nAnd it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears, but this was a very commonplace thing in the ’60s and ’70s. A sort of, like, vocal version of dressing for the job you want. You ever heard that phrase, right? And this has been entirely useless for me, but, like, my uncle is a doctor. Can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me? You’d be fucking thrilled. Imagine that, he’s doing the ward rounds, just like, “Oh, good morning. How are we feeling today?” You’re thinking, “This motherfucker’s gonna cure me in two hours.” “Make lunch plans!”\\nNow, Nanaji could never integrate in that way himself, so I think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically English jobs, right? So for the most part of his career, until he retired, he worked at John Lewis. Worked on the shop floor, selling curtains, fabrics ’cause it’s what he knew from the textile factories back in India. That’s probably the most English place anyone could possibly work. You’re not gonna get a more English place to work than the John Lewis Partnership. Unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big, red bus! “Fair play. That’s the most English place anyone could possibly work.” “You can’t hit us with a more English workplace than the big, red bus.”\\nUnless the first job you had in this country was literally at the baked-bean factory! It’s where it all started. Baked-bean factory in Bradford. 1964, baby. Came over here. Work on those beans. Now, uh, crucially, he did not want to, uh, right? By that stage, been married for just under a decade. Had three children. Had friends. Enjoyed his work in the textile factory. Thought he might be able to work his way up and everything. Very little interest in the United Kingdom. Hitherto no interest in beans, right? But, um… It was my grandmother who pushed this. Like, Nani, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, just…” India at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of. And so she, quite understandably, was like, “Listen, these children aren’t gonna have the life we wanna give them over here, but they’re taking people in England.” “So I need you to go over there. You just work it out, right?” “I’ll stay here with the children. You send money back to us.” “When you’ve saved up enough, we’ll come join you.” “All right. Cool. See you later. Bye.”\\nUh… He just did it, like, pretty soon thereafter. Just went… Like, listen, I like to think that I’m gonna be a pretty, sort of, accepting, thoughtful, 50-50 type of husband, right? However, if, just under a decade from now, my wife is to tell me that I must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when I would see them again, no way of communicating with them, no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety, that would not be the end of the conversation. Right? However, of course, for Nanaji, it was. How could it not be? That’s your dharma. That’s your duty. You have to do it. It’s your duty to your family, right? So he came over, not entirely on his own. Came with a couple of other guys who did the same, left the wives and kids. But they didn’t really see each other that much for a few years ’cause they ran a system called the eight-eight-eight, right? The eight-eight-eight is a system whereby, as mathematicians in the room can confirm, if three men each have two jobs, the shifts of which are eight hours long, and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week, you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work. One guy finishes his second shift, comes back, hits you awake, you go off to your first one, he falls asleep. Do that again and again. Saves two-thirds on the rent. That’s more that you can send to the wives and kids in India. And that’s the largest expense, isn’t it? What’s the second-largest expense? Probably food. But food, taken care of. ‘Cause at the baked-bean factory, they give you a tin of beans. Protein. Very important. For the second meal of the day, they had a big sack of rice, and they’d have some boiled rice in a pot. Apart from Sundays, obviously, because Sunday is treat day, so the boiled rice contained an onion, right? Some of you are probably thinking, “Surely, even in 1964, onions are cheap.” “Anyone could have onions whenever they wanted.”\\nFrom what you have heard so far about my nanima, do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a seven-a-week onion habit? It’s what you needed to do. It’s what they needed you to do, so it’s what you did. Eight-eight-eight, 24-7, 365. Five. Five years. He didn’t see his wife or children for five years. Imagine that. It’s not like, “At least I’ve got a good data plan” or something like that. Forget about calling. That was never gonna happen. Letters? Couple of letters a year. Each time you write one, you feel a bit closer. Every time you buy a stamp, you’re driving them further away. To the extent that my mum’s first memory in this country is Heathrow Airport, 1969. Her, her brother and sister all sort of hid behind their mum because they were just like, “Who’s this man?” Right? “Who’s this big man?” Right? Just like, “Why’s he smiling at me?” “Why’s he got these tears in his eyes?” “I guess he looks like that photograph that Mummy cries over sometimes if anyone ever hums that song, you know?”\\nI think about that a lot too, right? Imagine that. Trying to raise three children on your own for five years, occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters. Should’ve cried over a lime. She’d have made some money. Family reunited in 1969, the year after a very prominent Conservative politician got on a soapbox in Birmingham and said, “We must be mad, literally mad, to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents, who are, for the most part, the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population.” “It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre.” Now, Mr Powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. Because that’s quite a mouthful, my sister and I tend to go with “Mum”.\\nImagine that. Bringing your wife and kids into that the year after Rivers of Blood, when you’ve been here on your own since ’64, the same year as the Smethwick campaign. Right? It’s fucking grim. Right, just like the violence, the aggression, that goes without saying. It’s also… It’s always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest, yeah? The thing, I suppose, like, nowadays, we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually, uh, accused of quite serious theft from the workplace, uh, which was, like… Suspended and investigated for ages. Entirely cleared. He’d obviously not done it. But it didn’t take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories, that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like, “Who do you reckon they’re gonna believe, eh?”\\nImagine what that does to you. Like, your dignity and stuff. You have to do it again though. Tomorrow. You have to get up, brave face, for the kids. For the kids. It’s not like the kids have it any easier. There has been so much more progress in the last 20 years in this country than there was in the 40 that preceded it, and I feel very comfortable saying that because I went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle. My abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when I didn’t get mugged ’cause of Latin. Ha-ha-ha. My uncle’s abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it. My mum’s abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something, she has to change her clothes entirely, cook, eat, change her clothes entirely again. No matter how many times I tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world, all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank. And he died in 2002, so he died only remembering the shit bit, and he wasn’t old, so if he’d just hung on, he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different. You could have at least seen a bit of that before you left. Right, in 2016, I’m on a train, reading a newspaper. Sorry, mate. A newspaper. Right, um… Imagine, like, a solid tweet. Right, and… and… On a train, reading a newspaper, and it’s the day before the mayoral election in London, and there’s this big feature article, uh, where basically Sadiq Uncle is walking around the city, meeting the various voters and talking to them. In the feature, there’s this one guy. I’ve forgotten his name. It was a West African name, I think. He’s there with his five-year-old son, and he says to him, “Son, I want you to shake this man’s hand.” “This is Mr Khan.” “Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London.”\\nAnd in that moment of reading that, like, my hands stopped working, and the paper fell from my hands, and the tears fell from my eyes as I thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London,” was completely impossible, right? And yet 14 years later, it had become totally inevitable. So what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper? What would he have made of reading a sentence like that? What would he have made of reading the words, “This is Mr Khan. Mr Khan is going to be the next mayor of London”? Probably not much. I don’t think he really liked Muslims. “I may not agree with his politics, but…” And that’s how I felt Diwali before last, you know? Lit my divo, I went outside. I went back into the kitchen, and I poured a little glass of whisky, and I said, “You finding today interesting, eh?”\\nIt’s, like, obviously, problems still exist. None of this is to negate any of the problems that we’re all too aware of, right? But at the same time, pretending that the sort of stuff that I have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me. ‘Cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged, and it’s worth acknowledging. ‘Cause they’re the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible, right? I’m not an idiot. I wander around doing this for a living, all around the country. Occasionally, people shout ignorant shit at me in the street. Like, I’m not oblivious to that. And listen, my wife is a white Irish lady. Sometimes the two of us are going about our business, out and about, and people see us together. They don’t like that too much. They make their opinions known. They’re all so fuckin’ old, right? So old. Like, proper fossils, and… When I was a teenager, it would really… Like, I’d be ready to fight, and now a part of my brain just can’t help but think, “F… I think maybe you lost,” right? No, not… Lost isn’t correct ’cause it’s not like society’s a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the result’s been. But at the very least, I can acknowledge that I’m not the one who scored the goals. I’m a sub. They’re the ones who scored the goals. They scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line ’cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day, they were still, 1969, two down, right? And is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us? It’s worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is, right, because you see people, young people, trying, once again, to sow, sort of, any sorts of division in this society we’re trying to build. And you just think, “What the fuck are you doing?” “What are you doing?”\\nSurely, the point… If the point is anything, the point is to create a society in which, one day, everyone’s children get to go without saying. I think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that that’s possible, and I refuse to be anything else. It’s so easy to despair, right? Despair is the easiest position to have. It’s definitely my default. It just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion. Right? Try something else. Yeah? My wife’s way better than me at this. Like, she’s just, generally speaking, quite stable and well adjusted. I used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something. Turned out it’s because she has absolutely no social-media presence whatsoever. Uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work. If we were all slightly more like her, we’d all be slightly less fucking insane. By the way, no one’s changed their names. There’s no Mrs Shah to this story. Fortunately for all of us, in Irish, her name means “Prostitute Queen”.\\nDidn’t even take five weeks, not really. There was a point, one week, stood opposite her in the kitchen, and just all of a sudden, it’s like the trailers stopped. Like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers, and all of a sudden, every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison, “Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh. Shh.” [softly] “The picture’s about to start.” And now I get to see how it goes. That’s it. I mean, the ending’s gonna suck. Right. I’m not gonna know too much about it though. 100% gonna die first. Get in! Love it. Are you kidding me? Listen. It’s like… She’s really like, “Oh no, we shouldn’t have processed food in the house.” And all I want to do in my life is fuck a Chicago Town pizza. While chain-smoking and doing lines of salt. It’s nice to feel like you’ve had one of your last beginnings. Yeah? Frees you up to think about where things end up. It’s the interesting thing with love, right? Love, the way that it begins, begins in as many ways as there are people. If we were ever to have a conversation, and you said to me, “Ahir, can I just check, were you in love on your wedding day?”\\nWouldn’t that be a ridiculous question? You’d never ask. ‘Cause the answer’s obviously yes, right? What I find fascinating is that, if you were ever to meet my grandmother, and you were to say, “Ramila, can I check, on your wedding day, were you in love?”\\nIt would be an equally ridiculous question ’cause the answer would obviously be no. Of course she wasn’t. Right? There she was, little more than a girl, sat opposite little more than a boy. Total strangers, functionally. Of course she didn’t love that boy. Right? And yet it began. It began, right? Wild. Did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day? Of course she didn’t, right? Did she love the young man just under a decade later, who was willing to move continents because he knew that’s what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment? Of course she loved that man. She loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children, while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man in Heathrow Airport, 1969, the photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them. Of course she loved that man. She loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions. She loved that man as they danced together, shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible. For the next decades until his end, she loved that man. She loved that man in 2002 and well past that, as you will know if you go to a living room in Alperton, North West London, and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit. Of course she loves that man. That’s where it ends up. Nanaji died in 2002, a week after his birthday. He’d just turned 69. Oi! [chuckles softly] He’d brought a slightly hastened end onto himself, really, uh… Basically, when he retired, he wanted to spend as much time in India as humanly possible, but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties ’cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills. The place in India my family are historically from, a city called Ahmedabad, it’s incredibly polluted. Makes Central London look like the fucking Peak District. And so he would go over there and come back weaker, diminished. And he came back, and after the second trip, his grown-up children had to get him sat down in his own living room, and my mum had to say to her own dad, “You are killing yourself.” Right? “That’s what’s happening here. That’s what’s… It’s perfectly clear.”\\n“You go there. You come back. You’re weaker. You’re smaller.”\\n“You’re more diminished.”\\n“And can you not see what is happening to you?”\\n“It’s not even about seeing. Akshay is a doctor.”\\n“He can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose you.”\\n“Do you not feel what is happening?”\\n“So here’s the thing. You’ve had your fun. You’ve had two trips.”\\n“But now you stay over here, right?”\\n” ‘Cause we love you very much, so we wanna keep you around.”\\n“That’s how we’re all gonna look after one another.”\\n“So you’ve had your fun, but you’re not allowed to go any more.”\\n“Here you are. Good. Yes.”\\nAnd he had to look at three adult children and say, “No.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I never wanted any of this. Right, I never wanted any…”\\n“Like, my entire life, it turns out, has just been this means to an end, and that’s fine. It’s fine because you are the end.”\\n“So if I had to do it again, I would, with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face, I would do it again.”\\n“But can you not understand that I just need this at my end?”\\n“I can feel it far more than you can see it, or he can hear it.”\\n“Do you not understand I don’t care?”\\n“I don’t care because when I go over there, no one looks at me like I’m any different or yells at me or spits at me like I’m any different because I’m not any different.”\\n“When I go over there, I am a normal guy.”\\n“I have been a normal guy since the day I was born.”\\n“I just haven’t felt like it in so long.”\\n“You don’t understand that when I’m over there, I get to go without saying, and I haven’t gone without saying since nineteen sixty-fucking-four.”\\nHe used to run off the plane as quickly as possible, sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him, and go to the first part of the airport that wasn’t paved over, fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands. He would dig up the earth, and he would put it in his mouth. Can you imagine? Dig the earth and put… ‘Cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth. But you had to leave, you had to leave because that’s what they needed, and if they needed it, it’s what you had to do. He would dig the earth and put it in his mouth. It can’t have helped.\\n[laughter]\\nA third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying. And it killed him. That’s how much every human being wants that. You need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them. When he did die, he died in this country, in a hospital. D’you remember? “Hospital”.\\nAnd my mother was next to him, sat down. He was in a bed, not speaking any more. It was just the beeps, you know? Most of us have heard the beeps. And a nurse came by, saw my mum, and said, “Oh, you must be Mr Vaishnaw’s daughter.” She said, “Yes, I am.” And the nurse said, “Well, listen, I’m new to the ward, so I didn’t get a chance to speak to him, but I’ve spoken to some of the other nurses who did, and they said he was a good man.”\\nAnd my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in Heathrow Airport in 1969 and said, “He was the best of men.” And the line went flat. And if Nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment, then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men. And, like, objectively, he wasn’t.\\n[laughter]\\nDo you know what I mean? Not a baddie, but just, you know, a normal, complex, flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room. And probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for, I suppose. Yeah? But for someone, for someone, which it turns out is the only way that you can be, of course he was. He was the best of people for someone. He did what they needed from him when they needed it from him. He did the best that he could for the people he loved. If you can do that, then you can be the best of people for someone. If you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you, then you damn well get to go without saying, in my book. It is not that I have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement. The truth is what the truth always was in the first place, which is that the sacrifice is the achievement, and with that in mind, I know full well that till my end, Krishnadas Vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man I will ever meet. I have wanted to do this since January 1998, sat on the floor of my grandparents’ living room in Alperton, North West London, listening to Nanaji and Nanima laugh at episode one of Goodness Gracious Me. And for just over a decade, I have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career. But it’s not the job. Not any more. And it never will be again, I hope. The job, as I understand it, is what Nanaji understood the job to be. He was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be. He was the best of men. And I am now, in front of you, the World’s Best Dressed Man. [laughter and applause] Because I get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat. Because I am finally dressed for the job I want. And it will be the hardest job of a lifetime.\\n[in Gujarati] But with you, Nanaji, I’ll be able to do it, I hope. Sorry. “Hope…”\\n[laughter]\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThank you very much.\\n[Qawwali music playing]\\n[music ends]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAhir Shah, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen.\\nI don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!”\\nThis went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.\\nThat would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that.\\nI’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones.\\nIt doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots.\\nEverybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off.\\nI’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell.\\nIt’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.\\nA couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.\\nUh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.\\nI knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars.\\nAnd then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…”\\nAnd then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.”\\nHe was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them.\\nI know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out.\\nThe second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that.\\nSome people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect.\\nWe’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was.\\nBut if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated.\\nAnd then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off.\\nIf Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit.\\nYou know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in.\\nSomebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.”\\nThey’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening?\\nWait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.”\\nThe third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.”\\nWell, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike.\\nI remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us.\\nMy point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way.\\nI used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest.\\nHowever, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.”\\nAnd then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too.\\nThe ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure.\\nYeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works.\\nCan’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian.\\nObviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough.\\nYou guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true.\\n“♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪\\n♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪\\n♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪\\n♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪”\\nAnd his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪”\\nYou know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money.\\nLet’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

I forgot. The fourth time I met OJ Simpson. The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end. Good night.\\n♪ Ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\\n♪ In every ghetto ♪\\n♪ Ah-ah ♪\\n♪ Revolution ♪\\n♪ Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ♪\\n♪ In every ghetto… ♪\\nOne last thing.

Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you.\\nWhat a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up.\\nSo… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers.\\nThis is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens.\\nThe big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!”\\nSo, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers.\\nSo, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth.\\nYou don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird!\\nI know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah.\\nAnother question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.”\\nI did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit?\\nSo… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right?\\nBut apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free.\\nSo I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe.\\nI’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die.\\nI’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity.\\nBut I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner.\\nBut… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead?\\nBut… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks!\\nSo… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go.\\nThat’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!”\\nAnd there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much.\\nI hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went,\\xa0“Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nRicky Gervais, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 thought on “Ricky Gervais: Humanity (2018) | Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKen Wheelchair 22/03/2018 at 00:35  \\n\\n\\nProlefeed.\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that’s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I’m at the end of the tour right now. I’m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So… [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she’s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and I’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and I don’t see it getting better. Um… I’ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “Oh, I used to party with Madonna.” And I went, “You fucking what, when?” And she went, “I used to party with Madonna.” Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I’m not bragging. I didn’t get the model years. I didn’t get those years. I’ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um… So, I said, “So you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” And she went, “No, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” I go, “You need to elaborate on this story right now.” And she goes, “Oh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.” As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, “That’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” That’s a big one. “That’s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.” So she said, “I used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna’s house.” And she goes, “This one time, the four of us were over at Madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” And then I went, “Shut the fuck up!” And she went, “What?” I said, “I know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! You all started fucking each other!” And she went, “We did. We started…” “Just shut up!” And she goes, “What do you care for?” I said, “You’re the mother of my child! I don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ NBA player while you’re licking out Madonna’s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [Moaning] And she goes, “Oh, you’re being silly. What do you care for? You’ve partied way more than I have in my life.” And I went, “That is not true. I’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn’t call it a party.” For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It’s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We’re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, “Well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [Chuckles] I don’t… You know, I’ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I’ve had good nights out, but I’ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? I’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It’s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just… They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they’re going, “No, dude. Use the table. Don’t use your…” And I go, “Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um…” And it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring ’em in like, “Huh?” And you can do this. You can go… “Uh…” Like that. And they’ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.” When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.” And that’s a vastly different emotion that… I don’t think women will never… Yeah, okay.\\nThis is the thing. In America, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “And still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” And of course, that’s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like… a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don’t actually mean, but this is something I’m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I’m sorry. I… [Audience whooping] I’m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. I’m sure they do. I’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. What I’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now… I’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.” And don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. Right? We do. But there’s little things in society that you can’t change. Men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. There’s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine’s Day is just for women. They say it’s for romantics. They say it’s for couples or something like that. It’s just for women. There’s no man who gets excited by Valentine’s Day. There’s no man that when he sees the Valentine’s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “Oh, Valentine’s Day is coming!” Valentine’s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “How much money do I have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” It doesn’t stop there. Mother’s Day! Mother’s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend’s first Mother’s Day. And she went, “Oh, I wonder what I’ll get for Mother’s Day.” And I went, “Probably fucking nothing. He’s got no money. He’s six months old. What do you think he’s gonna buy you?” Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother’s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause I assumed that’s what Hank would have wanted her to have… and I wrote a card. I’m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I’m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] “Happy Mother’s Day. Love, Hank.” And I went, “H-A-N…” And then I did the “K” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. See, now I know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “Well, fathers have Father’s Day.” Father’s Day is bullshit. It’s fucking shit, Father’s Day. Father’s Day came around and my girlfriend went, “What do you want for Father’s Day?” And I went, “I don’t want anything. Don’t even worry about it. I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on. You gotta have something.” I said, “Honestly, I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on.” And I went, “It’s my fucking money. Just don’t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.” That’s why every single father has that one Father’s Day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! It’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “I heart Dad.” And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go… “That cost me nothing, that mug.” [Audience whooping] See… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I’ve got it, right? April 18th… Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It’s good, isn’t it? Everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It’s nice. A month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “Oh, the decorations are up!” [Men whooping] And it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine’s Day when they don’t get a gift. You could go like, “Oh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. They’ve, uh…” I’m thinking, I don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I’m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting “Jim Jefferies” on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, “April 18th.” ‘Cause it’s good, right? You’re in a bar. You’re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go… Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt.\\nThe weird thing is I’m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I’m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it’s a much more… I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex… Oh, you know… I do it. I get involved, ’cause I feel like I have to. You know, I… But I’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh… When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… But the thing is, you can’t smell porn. You don’t smell porn. You just… You just watch it. They never… And it’s different, porn. It’s different. They clean the girl’s asshole. They pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. I’m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She’s like… You’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “Put it in my ass.” She’s inviting. It’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. And then she’s like… She says things… I don’t know, things like, “I’m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.” And… And the experience I’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I’ve… My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… It’s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “I’m gonna act like I enjoy it.” She does that whole, “Yeah. Oh, no, that’s good.” [Moaning] Ahh! ♪ I’m having a good time ♪ And then they’re always going, “Are you done? Are you close to done?” You never fuck a pussy and they go, “Are you almost done? Finish this.” Like that. If you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don’t know how much they get paid. I’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. It’s the opposite bit of society. Um… But they do a thing called “ATM.” I don’t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for “ass to mouth.” That’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “I love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.” And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [Applause] she’s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. Now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “Well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering]\\nSo… I’m a father. Um… I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. He’s a good little boy. No, he’s a great little fella. I really like him. Um… My girlfriend super loves him, though. It’s fucking creepy. And… I’m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn’t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn’t fuck it. I… I just don’t get along with women. You know how it is. I don’t want them in my house, and… So… Because you dream, see… For example, okay? When Hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “Aw, that’s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.” That’s what I think… ‘Cause that’s what I think about my son. I hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. I don’t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “Oh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you’re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” Right, you know… And it’s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. They’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it’s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “Uh, uh!” Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, “Everyone, my boyfriend’s here. Here’s my boyfriend. Give him here. He’s my boyfriend.” And then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ It’s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl… Let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “Hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. Give her here. Give her here. She’s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She’s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don’t worry about a thing.” [Applause] [Cheering] So… Also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It’s just little things. Even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. There’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. I don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. ‘Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don’t give a shit. Fucking… My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I’ve got shit on my dick, I’ll ring me mate Jason up and go, “Hey, Jason… It’s happened again. I got shit on my dick.” And he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “Oh, I can’t wait to call Karen.” [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you… When my girlfriend got pregnant… When you meet… When you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “It is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.” And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “You’re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It’s over. You’re not gonna sleep.” They’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I’ve had girlfriends. That’s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “Fuck it! Let’s have a kid.” Fucking did it, right? These other people, man… You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “We’re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?” And you wanna say, “No, you’re really boring and we hate you.” But you go, “Oh, okay, great. You’re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.” And… And then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “We have to see how our careers are going and shit.” And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “From our family to yours.” And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “What the fuck is this shit?” And they’re like, “We had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.” And you go, “Well, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control…” And then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “What’s happening? A new person.” And they’re like, “Fuck off. We don’t love you anymore. We’re going.” And they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you’re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I’m not saying ’cause they look the same. I’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going… “Yolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.” [Jeffries chuckles]\\nI’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh… Gun control. Now… No, wait. Before you… Don’t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, “Yeah! Do it, Jim!” No, let’s just… [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I’m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the… Oh, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like guns, right? I’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn’t been beaten. And… Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. I don’t know how or why this happened, uh… Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, “That’s it! No more guns!” And we all went, “Yeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.” Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “Maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my guns!” [Whooping] So, here’s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It’s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “Fuck off. I like guns.” It’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. And there’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing wrong with saying, “I like something. Don’t take it away from me.” But don’t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] “I need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.” Really? Is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? Is it? I’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, “Well, that’d never happen to me.” You don’t know that, because you know what?\\n♪ From time to time We all get sad ♪ \\n♪ One day you’re happy Then you’re sad ♪ \\n♪ And then, uh-oh ♪\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] “Well, imagine if you had a gun.” And I’m like, “All right. I was naked at the time. I wasn’t wearing my holster. I wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.” What world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? You have guns ’cause you like guns! That’s why you go to gun conventions! That’s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “Fucking yeah!” Like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, “That’d never happen in my house ’cause I’m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.” Then they’re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you’re like, “Wait there, fuck-face! Oh! You’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I’m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother’s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother’s birthday? Maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [In whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, “None of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” I… I think they’re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] “Oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” And then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “You’re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.” Then she’d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “Why don’t they like me?” Let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, “Oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” They go, “We’ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.” Yeah, that’ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and… [Mimicking machine gun] And you’ve got Kevin. Now, I’m sure Kevin’s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don’t agree with me. Don’t think I don’t. Out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They’re looking around, going, “Wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” And then… there’s the last 10%. And they’re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. Just… And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I’m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “If you don’t like it, go home! If you don’t like it, go home!” And my answer to that is, “No.” I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I’ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And… unless you’re an American Indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It’s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don’t know what it says. I’ve never seen it. If there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. And don’t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had… Fucking, I get it, right? I’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I’m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] “You cannot change the Second Amendment!” And I’m like, “Yes, you can. It’s called an ‘amendment.'” If you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don’t think your constitution is set in stone. You’ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, “Hey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let’s get that one out. Let’s get that one out.” You used to have this other thing in America called, uh… slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, “That’s it. No more slaves!” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my slaves!” And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “Why should I have my slaves taken off me? I’m a responsible slave owner. I’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I… I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!” That’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me? I’ve done nothing wrong.” Look, I agree with you. If you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that’s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! “Oh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.” Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can’t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “Thanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” See, that’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me, I’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” Who’s to say you’re not crazy? That’s the thing about crazy people. They don’t know they’re crazy. That’s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, “I think, therefore I am.” You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that’s it. Right now, I think I’m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That’s what I think I’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] “I hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.” [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, “Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It’ll be delivered to your house. That’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. You’ve got $34,000. You’re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger’s as fuck. Right? I don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] “Guns! Who wants to sell me a gun?” Now, I’m gonna wrap this up. We won’t talk about it anymore. Now… See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with… That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [Audience cheering] – Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You’re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I’m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets… Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what’s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “Fuck you, buddy! Ah, you’re not a bad guy. You’re all right.”\\nNow… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause I don’t behave myself in there, so I’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘Cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like… Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That’s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “Hey, ladies. He’s a fireman.” And he comes out with his hose and like that… And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “You can’t take care of your kids.” It’s… And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don’t know… I don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. There’s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… That’s what a private “dance” is, right? I don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can’t imagine that there would be. I don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… She goes, “How was it?” And she goes, “Well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.”\\nSo Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. It was… I’m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… Now… The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He’s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now… the great thing about DJ is… he already looks disabled. He has that “latter stages of AIDS” thing going on. It’s great for casting. Anyway, but… I didn’t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors’ Union of America said, “You cannot do that.” Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, “All right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, “Can you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?” So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don’t know why. Maybe they’re just lazy. They don’t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I’d ever seen in my life. He was like… Think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of… [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and I’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, “Thank you so much for coming in.” And then we did the dialog together, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, “That’s our guy. That’s who we gotta pick.” And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought… “If he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” So he comes in… He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, “Whoa! What’s going on there, kicky?” And he goes… “Oh, you got me! I’m not disabled.” And I said, “You’re fucking what now?” And he goes, “I’m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.” And I said, “Just shut up. So let me… This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” And he went… “Yeah.” And I said, “You’re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.” And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and I’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and I just think, “I’m gonna call this guy up. I’m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?” And I’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like… And I thought, “This has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” The shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [Mimicking camera shutter] Like… [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “This guy’s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!” Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I’m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “Ta-da!” And we would have gone, “That was very good.” But I’ll tell you what you don’t do. Don’t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, “You did very good.” He’s like, “Thank you, Jim.” [Laughing]\\n[Chuckles] I was, uh… I go to a therapist… ’cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “I’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, “Red,” and I went, “Blue.” And then she went, “Cooking,” and I went, “Food,” and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went… For the last question, she went, “And what’s your favorite thing in the world?” And I went… “Coming on a girl’s face.” Now… Now, I could’ve said things like… “Ice cream” is a good answer. “Hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. But I said, “Coming on a girl’s face.” And I’ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. – I… – [Cheering] I’m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl’s on her knees and you… It’s so… And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, “When a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” There was never that… never that moment. But, by golly, if it’s not fun. I find it… To… Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, “Bravo!” Don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, “And here’s the women who take a load on their face.” And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “God bless you, ladies.” [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the… Like that… I don’t know why, but I enjoy… I know it’s a lie. I know you’re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it’s such a, “Oh, jeez, I’m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there’s a good chance I’ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.” But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I’m like, “You fucking slut… Oh, I love you. Ah… Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um… Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh… All right, I’m going to get a towel. I’ll get a towel. I’ll get you a towel. All right. You’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See… this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I’m there wiping come off his mother’s face.\\nI think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I’m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “Argh!” Like that. And I went… [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, “Hello, Hankie.” And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, “I love my daddy. Love, Hank.” But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the “K,” and… then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, “G’day, Hankie!” And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don’t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I’ve been telling everyone. And I can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He’s been training for this his entire life.\\nI think I’ve, uh… I think I’ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, “Oh, I think like an American person now.” And I’m happy to do it. I just… I’ll tell you what happened. I was flying around… I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I’m so used to airports and stuff here in America that… Okay, what happens is, when you go… I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don’t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “Tickets, please.” And I’m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. ‘Cause I get through airports quick, man. I’m like, “Fucking there you go.” And she went, “Put your ID away. I don’t need to see that.” And I went… “I think you do.” And she went, “I don’t… Why would I need to see your ID?” And I said, “I might be a terrorist.” And she went, “Would showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?” “No, I’d probably still blow the plane up.” So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I’m so good at the airports. I’m already taking my shoes off as I’m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I’m American, and they’re losing their fucking shit. They’re like, “Oh, for fuck’s sake! One of these cunts, eh?” And the TSA guy goes, “Hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” And I went… [Shouting] “I don’t know! Maybe they’re bombs?” And he went… “But they’re not, are they?” I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone’s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “Jeez, mate. That’s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?” “It might also be a bomb.” And then the guy said the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. He went… “Oh, come on, mate. You wouldn’t have two bombs.” [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense.\\nAll right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You’re fucking missing out, mate. If you don’t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine’s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone… He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine’s Day, right? Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running’s their second sport. You wouldn’t have thought that. Anyway… I’m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here’s the difference. Picture my accent, but I’m punching a black person. What I’m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So… she’s coming out of the shower. She’s been drying her hair. She’s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He’s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] “What the fuck is this? I’ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.” And she’s like, “Oh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?” “Who am I? I’m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That’s who the fuck I am.” “Well, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [Audience exclaiming] – I know. [Audience laughing] “Oh! Fuck you!” “No! Fuck you! I’m leaving you!” And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “You fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day… that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don’t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!” That’s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. “Oh, you’re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.” She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn’t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar’s one of the few men on Earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so… Boing! Ah! So… I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now… in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look… I’ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. I’ve never raped a man, but… if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. Like, “You want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?” There’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He’s the hero.\\nAll right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, – I thank you very much for coming. – [Audience groaning] No, I said, “soon,” not “over.” It’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always… I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I’m going to go, “Fucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.” [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don’t think I’ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don’t know if I’ll be invited this time. They’ll be like, [In South African accent] “We don’t like him. He’s no good.” Anyway, so, I’m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You’ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um… But it was all right ’cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn’t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice ’cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I’ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. So… I’m wearing a white T-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, “Hello,” and the lady goes, [In South African accent] “Oh, Mr. Jefferies, I’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” I said, “You what now?” She goes, “Business class is full. You have been downgraded.” And I said, “I understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.” And she went, “I’m sorry, sir. There’s nothing I can do.” And then I just went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” Now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” And she went, “Please do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!” And I said, “Are you, a white South African, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” Anyway… tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] “What is wrong here? What is wrong?” And I said, “I bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.” And he goes, “What do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can’t do anything.” He goes, “I’ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, “There’s nothing I can do.” So I walk off with my ticket. I’m walking through the airport like, “Fucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, “Tickets, please.” And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] “I’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” And I said… [Inhales sharply] “I bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “Next.” [Audience exclaiming] “Listen here, you fucking cunt.” [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, “Don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” And I said, “I want to speak to Simon Fulcher,” like I’m… And they go, “All right.” They ring the manager up, and then they go… He goes, “Is it the pale Australian man?” And the guy went, “Yes.” He goes, “We’ve had problems with him. Let him through.” Right? So I go through. I’m sitting there, I’m eating my peanuts. And I’m just angry now, going, “Fucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking…” Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all… And whenever I see Americans abroad… I’ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. You’re just walking around going, [In American accent] “Oh, this is great! Look at that. That’s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what’s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.” Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] “Did anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.” And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, “You can fuck off and all! You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve been downgraded!” And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “Fucking downgraded!” And the woman in the group was doing this, “Don’t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?” And all the men in the group were like, “Hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.” ♪ It doesn’t matter These people seem very angry, so ♪ And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] “Hey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.” And then I thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and I said, “Look, mate, don’t worry about it. It’s not like it’s your fault.” And I said, “Why are you in such a big group anyway?” And he goes, “Oh, we’re in Neil Diamond’s band. That’s Neil Diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and I reacted like he was one. I went, “Neil Diamond!” And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] “Hey, what’s going on?” And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, “Neil! Me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” And Neil went, “Oh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.” “You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!” And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don’t know if you have the Internet, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. “Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!” Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let’s have a drink. Bye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJim Jefferies, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.”\\nYou’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.”\\nIt’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?\\'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around.\\nI talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?”\\nMy wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.”\\nI grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.\\'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.”\\nMy wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.”\\nI have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.”\\nI loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!”\\nI didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo.\\nIt’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was.\\nAnd there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.”\\nKids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.”\\nNo, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.”\\nMy dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.\\'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero.\\nThe weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.”\\nWhat are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy.\\nI was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.”\\nI temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.\\'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy.\\nThat’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it.\\nI wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.\\nThat is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president.\\nAnd I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton.\\nMy mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton.\\nNow, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later?\\nSo, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!”\\nI learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!”\\nAnyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service.\\nWe land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life.\\nAnd I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992.\\nLet’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.\\nGood night, Chicago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJohn Mulaney, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

What’s happening? What’s going on, Bay Area? Listen to me, tonight, tonight’s gonna be special, San Jose.\\n[music ends]\\nYou know what I love when I look out here? I love the diversity I see here. [audience laughs and cheers] Not racially. Financially. [audience laughs] [Hasan chuckles jokingly] The good stuff. The stuff that matters. The stuff that’s real. The money, all right? There’s money in this room. But there’s also not money in this room. [audience laughs] That’s the Bay. You’re not as progressive as you think you are, Bay Area. In this room right now, there’s a guy who owns three homes. And he’s sitting directly next to a dude who only owns three hoodies. [audience laughs] And one of y’all’s getting stabbed tonight. It’s probably the landlord.\\n[laughs]\\n[audience laughs]\\nBecause it’s all here. I can see it. It’s all here. Whoo-hoo. We got it all here. We got the one percent, right? We got, like, Palo Alto, Los Altos. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Stanford area, right? Yeah, the one percent. Yeah! Yes. You definitely drive a Tesla. I can see it. [audience laughs] Yeah, the one percent right here, eh? Then way the fuck back there, we have the 99% just… [audience cheering] Hayward, Richmond, East Oakland. Yeah! Yeah, this is your landlord! Kill him! Kill him! Why does he keep raising the rent? [laughs] This is why I had to do it in the Bay. Even when you’re rich in the Bay, you’re poor. [audience laughs] You could be a Google engineer making 900 grand a year, and you have to live in a trap house in East Oakland, and you’re on OnlyFans making them cheeks clap just so you can pay rent. Just so you can pay this uncle rent. Dude, we have Zillow.com, and we’re still a functioning society. How? Do you know what Zillow.com is? Zillow.com is a website where you can type in the address of someone you’re jealous of… [audience laughs] and you can see their mortgage payment. [audience laughs] Dude, we’re never gonna own. Millennials, Gen Z, y’all are never, never gonna own homes.\\nAnd it’s our fault.\\n[woman] Yup. We fumbled the bag. Because for years we were praying to God. “God, please fix the housing crisis.” “Please open up the supply of available homes in this country.” And then, in March of 2020, God was like, “Here.” [audience laughs] “Here’s a disease that specifically kills old people.” [audience laughs] And we were like, “No!” “Wear a mask!” “Save Grandma!” “Stop the spread!” Let it spread. [audience laughs] Let God cook. [audience laughing and cheering] Yeah, we’re idiots, Californians. We’re fucking idiots. Look at all the states that were anti-mask. Plenty of homes. [audience laughs] Nevada, Georgia, Florida. Plenty of homes. Plenty of dead grandmas. These people accept God’s blessings. [audience laughs] All I’m saying is if you were pro-mask, you cannot complain about housing prices. What do you want? You wanna save Grandma or you want a backyard? You can’t have both. [audience laughs] Dude, the same problem with the housing market, these fucking Boomers will not die, is the same problem with the US government.\\nThese fucking Boomers will not die.\\n[audience cheers]\\nOur entire government is just a mass nursing home-dot-gov. I mean, it’s fucking… Uncle, why are you clapping? That’s you. You’re like, “Yeah!” What? Even he’s like, “They’re too old, man!” [audience laughs] This is gonna come out right before the election. People are arguing about the president. Fucking zoom out. Look at Congress. There’s 535 members of Congress, and they’re all old as fuck. Dude, Nancy Pelosi is 84 years old. [audience murmuring] Is anyone here 84 years old? [audience laughs] Yeah, of course not! Yes, it’s 7:00 p.m. Of course not! It’s seven o’clock. You’re asleep. Of course you’re not here. Why would you be here? Why the fuck would you be here? People are like, “Oh, Hasan, you’re really ageist.” “That really age…” Yeah, I am capital-A ageist. [audience laughs] Write about it. Substack it. Make it the headline. “I am age…” Age matters. Ask Drake. [audience exclaims] It is a pertinent detail. Hey! Hey! Hey! I thought we were the science people. Progressives, “Trust the science.” “Believe the science. Don’t let your kids on social media.” “The synapses in their brain…” “The synapses in their brain are still develo…” “The synapses.” Senator Chuck Grassley is 90 years old. [audience laughs] What do you think the synapse…? What… [audience cheering] He has the MRI brain scan of an NFL quarterback. It’s fucking applesauce up there. Why don’t we treat our politicians the same way we treat our professional athletes? Here in America, the moment you lose just a little bit of edge as an athlete, we fucking turn on you. [audience laughs] Within two years. Even the GOATs, right? Michael Jordan with the Wizards. Kobe with the Achilles. Look at the way that we treated Tom Brady. The moment Tom Brady couldn’t give us an eighth Super Bowl, we were like, “Brady, you got two more years.” This motherfucker lost to the Rams, right? “One more year, Brady.” Then this motherfucker lost to the Cowboys. “Bring this old geezer to the back of the shed.” “Let’s put two bullets into his skull.” “Let’s tear apart his marriage. Let’s ridicule his children.” “Let’s roast his ass on Netflix in 190 countries and just piss all over his legacy.” Just, “Tudum!”\\n[audience whooping]\\n[laughs] Now look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [audience exclaims] Eighty-seven years old! Ruth Bader Ginsburg battled cancer, five times in the last 20 years of her life. And Barack Obama was like, “Please, Ruth, for the love of God, retire so I can replace you.” And this geriatric coffin-dodger was like, “Fuck you, Barry.” [audience laughs] “I’ll see you in fucking hell.” [audience laughs] And every progressive was like, “Yas, queen!” “Notorious RBG.” If we treated Ruth Bader Ginsburg the same way we treated Tom Brady, abortion would still be legal in all 50 states. [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s interesting? Depending on where I do that joke, the audience reacts very differently. Sometimes when I do that joke, Trump fans get mad at me. Sometimes Biden fans get mad at me. But here’s my thing. Why are you a fan? [audience laughs] You know? Like, you’re like a fan of a president. You have like a T-shirt. You have like a poster on the wall. Like, “This is my guy!” “He’s my…” Like, being a fan of a politician is like being a fan of a national bank. [audience laughs] Imagine walking through downtown San Jose and seeing some loser with a T-shirt. Just like, “Citibank!” You see another guy, “No, fuck you, bro! Wells Fargo!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Do you wanna be on the right side of history?” It’s like, dude, I’ve banked with both. They will disappoint you for different reasons. Because I’ve met these people. I’ve met all of them. I’m part of the Illuminati. [audience laughs] They all reach out to me during election season. They think I’m the brown whisperer. [audience laughs] They think if we have lunch, I’ll blow the conch. Know what I mean? I’ll be like… [imitates blowing conch shell] “Browns… we must vote for Andrew Yang!” [audience laughs and applauds] No, why are you clap… No, don’t clap! They’re all fucking insane. I am 38 years old. This will be the tenth presidential cycle of my lifetime. Every president in my lifetime goes into office a sociopath and then leaves a war criminal. [whoops] Because they all want one thing. You know what they want? They want the ring. Ooh, they want the ring of power. They want it. They want it more than marriage, more than family. More than their kids. Look at Hillary Clinton. Look at how bad Hillary Clinton wanted to be president. Hillary Clinton wanted to be president so bad, she was willing to sit in the same office… [audience exclaiming] Not a different office. Not a replica House of Cards office. The Oval Office. That is sociopathic ambition. That’s why there’s so many Indians in politics. [audience laughs] Bro, we got sociopathic ambition. In one generation, look how many Indians there are in politics, running the highest offices around the world. One generation. Rishi Sunak. Nikki Haley. Vivek Ramaswamy. Half of Kamala Harris when she wants our vote. We are fucking killing it!\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Hasan laughs] Dude… Look at the Republican Party. There are more Indians in the Republican Party than my bachelor party. [audience laughs] And right now it’s wild. Y’all, more minorities with melanin, ooh, joining the hard-R Republicans. It’s happening more than ever. And all my white NPR tote-bag friends, it fries their brain. They’re like, “What the fuck is going on?” “Why are all these Mexicans voting for Donald Trump?” [audience laughs] “He calls them rapists!” I’m like, “Chelsea… do you know what I would let a politician call me if I could pay zero percent federal income tax?” [audience laughs] “I would let you body-cavity search me at every airport.” “Spit in my mouth and call me a terrorist.” [imitates spitting] Daddy wants to pay zero-percent FICA. That’s the thing Caucasia will never understand about Beige-istan. We are way more practical than we are progressive. [audience laughing and cheering]\\nSir, what’s your name?\\nNicholas. Nicholas. Great, perfect.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] You’re clapping at “Beige…” Do you know what Beige-istan is?\\nSort of.\\nOkay. You’re like, “Sort of”? Gentlemen, let me bring you into this as well.\\nMy good sir, what’s your name?\\nVlad. Vlad. Perfect. And…?\\nIan.\\n…Ian. Okay. So there’s… There’s white America. There’s Black America. Then there’s Beige-istan. [audience laughs] And, I mean, that’s just everybody. Indians, Latinos, Filipinos, wherever the fuck Bruno Mars is from. Beige-istan. Right? Okay? Listen, Beige-istan, we got four issues. Politicians, they pander to us. We just got four issues. You do these four, we’ll vote for you. Send this to the governor. These are the four issues. Number one. Give me a green card. [audience laughing and cheering] [laughs] You see that? Everyone, “I’ll suck your dick! Give me that green card!” “Give me an H-1B!” Number two. Believe in God. Preferably one of the religions that makes you feel bad after you masturbate.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThose are the real ones. Number three. I told you, I don’t like paying taxes. [audience laughs] Number four. Don’t bomb my home country. [audience cheering and whooping] But if you give me number one… I’ll let you do number four. [Hasan laughs maniacally] The way you leaned into him, you know what I’m talking about! You know the Beige guilt. We feel so much Beige guilt. Oh! We talk about white guilt all the time. You know what you did. God knows what you did, right? Black people, you have no guilt. That’s why you guys can dance, right? You didn’t hurt anybody. Like, “Look at the rhythm.” He can’t dance. Like, “Slavery!” Fuck, right? It’s too much. It’s too much. But Beige guilt’s different. Beige guilt, we’re immigrants. We’re immigrants by choice. We know the world is like Star Wars. You have the Empire ran by Lord Vader, that’s America. [audience laughs] The Empire has all the money, the weapons, the military bases all over the galaxy. And for the past half-century, the Empire has been bombing the shit out of the Rebellion. That’s Beige-istan. Cambodia, Korea, Vietnam, Japan. [scats “The Imperial March\\nDarth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Gaza. [scats “The Imperial March\\nDarth Vader’s Theme”] [imitates explosion then screams] Then in 1982, my dad got a green card to go live in the Empire. And for the past 40 years, we’ve been funding the destruction of Tatooine. And we did all that… for a white BMW 3 Series. [audience laughing and whooping] Which ironically looks like a Stormtrooper. [audience laughs] I’m joking, by the way. I don’t own a white BMW 3 Series. I lease… [audience laughs] …a 2023 Kia Carnival. I lease it. So if you wanna fact-check me, I just wanna let you know, I lease a 2023 Kia Carnival, $431 a month. We leased it from Columbia Kia. We got it at the Summer Kia Sales Event. You can get a brand-new Kia Sorento or Kia Carnival for zero down, zero APR financing. The Kia Summer Sales Event starts now. Kia, movement that inspires. I have to do this now, you guys. I have to be factually accurate. Because I don’t know if you saw this last year. The New Yorker fact-checked my stand-up comedy.\\n[audience whooping]\\n[laughs] Yeah. They were just like, “Ah! Ho-ho-ho! Breaking news. Magicians aren’t wizards.” And now, now I have a “controversies” tab on my Wikipedia. [audience laughing and applauding] No! Why are you… No! Don’t clap! What are you doing? Why are you clapping? What the fuck is wrong… It’s a dorky controversy. What is wrong with you guys? It’s not even a good one. I didn’t fuck a porn star. [audience laughs] I didn’t diddle a boy. [audience laughs] I got caught embellishing for dramatic effect. [audience laughs] Same crime your aunt is guilty of over Thanksgiving. [audience laughs] [audience cheering and whooping] You know what’s wild? This is the greatest irony. The greatest irony of all of this is that if you want to call me out for being a liar, you don’t have to fact-check my stand-up comedy. I’m a heterosexual man. [audience laughs] I lie all the time. [audience laughs] I let that shit fly like Steph. Like, I’m just like, “Lie.” Oh! Lie. Like, let it fly. Over dumb shit. Stupid… I’ll be at CVS checking out. Just… [imitating scanner beeping] Like, “Oh, my God. Hey!” “Um, do you wanna donate to the American Diabetes Association?” I’ll be like, “Oh, yeah, maybe later.” I’m never donating. [audience laughs] And both my parents have diabetes.\\n[audience exclaiming and laughing]\\n[Hasan laughs] Yes! You can’t guilt… No, don’t you fucking judge me. I have already donated to the Minhaj Diabetes Association. I bought my dad a fucking Peloton. He never uses it. [audience laughs] He only uses it to hang his wet towels. He’s like, “Oh, look at that. Wow.” “Look at how fast it dries, Hasan. Wow! Why aren’t you donating?” I’m like, “Why aren’t you pedaling?” Let’s start with the problem and not the symptom. I’m never donating. And I’m definitely getting diabetes. That’s the crazy part. And I should care. I’m almost 40 years old. I can feel it. The midlife crisis has hit. There’s a lot of guys my age, around this age. I can feel it in the room. Every guy my age is trying to get rich or ripped as quickly as possible. [audience laughs] Just software engineers out here biohacking. Fucking cold-plunging. Fucking doing Brazilian jujitsu. Fucking doing this shit. [audience laughs] Fucking flipping tires. Idiots. Idiots. Fucking pharmacist hard pivoting into financial experts. Getting into crypto. Idiots. Every woman in my life, y’all could not be bothered by crypto fucking currency. You’re just like, “Nah.” “I know what this is.” “I had an aunt that sold Avon. This is some bullshit.” [audience cheering] “This is Herbalife for men.” Go back upstairs and keep playing fantasy football, you fucking idiot. [audience laughs] How old are you, my man?\\n17.\\n17? So you were looking into crypto for sure. [laughs] You know what it is? I’m part of a generation of men that don’t read, but listen to podcasts. [audience laughs] Terrifying. All my homeys out here texting me alpha-male memes, just… “Hard times make hard men.” “Hard men make good times.” “Good times make soft men.” “A society will never value its men until the wolves are at the door.” I’m like, “Sanjay, you’re a software engineer.” “Shut the fuck up.” Why… [audience cheering and whooping] Why are you texting me like you’re Julius Caesar? “Whatever, bro.” “Mamba mentality.” Mamba mentality! Sanjay, you blew your knee out playing pickleball and you’re quoting Kobe Bryant. If Kobe knew you were quoting him, he’d put you in a helicopter and crash that shit himself. [audience exclaiming] [man coughing] You okay, bro? Don’t die. You all right? [audience laughs] [laughs] It wasn’t… How old are you, bro?\\nI’m 19.\\nYou’re 19. Big chain poppin’! Ooh! [laughs] [Hasan laughs] There’s a lot of chains on right now. Just a lot of, “Ooh.” A lot of just Desi Drake energy here tonight. The way y’all are lined up is fucking Algebra 2 Trig, just like, ta-ta! Ninety-degree angle just fucking make it. Make it perpendicular. Ladies, you wanna know why all these guys secretly listen to Jordan Peterson?\\n[woman 1] Why?\\n[woman 2] Why? I’ll tell you why. I’ll tell you. We’re scared. We’re so afraid that the best is behind us. The best hairline. [audience laughs] The best body. The best dick. [audience laughs] Back there. You’re 17, right? [scoffs] I remember 17, man. How old are you?\\n[man] I’m 39.\\nYou’re 39? Remember when you were 17? Remember when your shit was just like, pow! Remember when it was just… [yells] Right? It was like the Bruce Lee one-inch punch. You’re just like… [yells] [audience laughs] You remember that shit, man? When I’d be at a urinal, it was just… Tsst! Tsst! Tsst! It was like a laser. It was just like fucking SEAL Team Six taking out Osama bin Laden. Just, “Got him!” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, “Clear! Got him!” Right? And now, 38, my shit is just… Whoo. It’s just… Pew! It’s just like an Israeli drone strike. Just… Oh fuck, it’s a school. Oh fuck, it’s a church. Oh, fuck, it’s a refugee camp. I didn’t mean for it to go there. [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs] That really divided the room. You know, it’s interesting. That’s every issue in America now. Everything is binary now. War, the economy, politics, it’s just two sides. It’s not what the media’s telling you. It’s not rich versus poor. It’s not Black versus white. It’s not Democrats versus Republicans. It’s insane people and insufferable people.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s it! All right? [audience cheering and whooping] [Hasan laughs] You know the insane people. You know them. You went to high school with them. They’re still on Facebook. They have a gun in their Facebook profile photo. You’re like, “Whoa, Travis.” “What up?” “Where were you January 6th?” [audience laughs] They’re nuts. They’re nuts. But Travis is fun. [audience laughs] Then there’s the insufferable people. [sighs] [clicks tongue] A lot of them are here tonight. [audience laughs] Just these dorky-ass, teacher’s pet, hall monitors. Just, “No, no, no, no, no!” “No, but actually.” “No, but tech…” These vitamin D-deficient, mouth-breathing, insufferable lo… “You said this, but it’s actually this. You wrote this, but…” “Did you see my Slack? I pinged you.” These insufferable losers that pick pointless fights. The type of insufferable losers that will go on a daytime talk show like Ellen and get mad at Ellen DeGeneres for mispronouncing their name. I mean, what type of insufferable fucking loser would do such a thing?\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, that was me. I was that person. Yes, that’s a rhetorical question. Yes, you were 13 when this happened. Years ago, I went on Ellen’s talk show and I go, “Hey, Ellen.” “Hey, Ellen DeGeneres.” “My name isn’t Hasan Minhaj.” “It’s Hasan Minhaj.” “Say it right.” “This is the name of my ancestors.” Of course she couldn’t say it right. Because she’s Ellen. [audience laughs] She’s a 65-year-old white billionaire who lives in Montecito. She can’t speak Urdu. [audience laughs] She’s Ellen, she’s not a Sufi poet. [audience laughs] And ever since I fought this pointless fight, people say my name worse. [audience laughs] People run up to me in the street and they shout the wrong name at me with vigor. [audience laughs] Like they’re trying to score points on Duolingo. [audience laughs] They’re just like, “Hussein!” [audience laughing] “Hummus!” “Hamas!” Ding, ding, ding! “Yes! Yes! Yes!” “I knew his name was Hamas!” “Five letters. Starts with an H.” “He looks like a Hamas.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Take me to the tunnels.” I’m like, “I don’t know where they are.” Oh, no. Ian! My life is perfect and I’m out here arguing with Ellen over vowels. Why did I do that? Why did I… Why wasn’t… [muttering] Why did I do that? I was so insufferable. I used to make fun of my Chinese friends for having two names. Yeah. I used to make fun of Ronny Chieng for being an Asian sellout. [audience laughs] Wait, you think Ronny Chieng’s real name is Ronny Chieng? [audience laughs] Look at his face. Look at his Chinese-Malay… No! His real name is Xin Yi Chieng. But he knows if he meets Ian… Ian will be like, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, streaming now on Disney Plus.” So instead…\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n…he goes, “Hi!” “I’m Ronald McDonald.” “Nice to meet you.” “Here to bring shareholder value to the company.” “Call me Ron-Ron.” [audience laughs] Because Chinese people are smart. They know you have to have a Chinese name, and then Americans-are-dumb-as-fuck name. [audience laughs] But I was the problem. “No…” [muttering] “It’s the point!” And it bit me in the ass. I remember I used to close my set with this joke. In New York City it would be my closer. I’d be like, “Ronny Chieng is an Asian sellout, good night!” I’m leaving the club. And this woman in the audience gets up and chases me into the street. She was like, “Excuse me.” “Oh, ho-ho! I could be a normal person, but I have a point to prove.” [audience laughs] And I’m not gonna say her ethnicity… [audience laughs] [audience laughs] …but her name was Ashley. [audience laughs] E-I-G-H. Just…\\n[audience exclaims]\\n[yells] “Excuse me. Can I see the manager?” “Hi! Hello. Hi.” “Hey stop.” “Hello.” “Hmph.” [audience laughs] “I saw your skit back there.” “And I have to say, ‘really?'” “Really?” “Making fun of Asian names.” “These are the jokes we’re making with our platform?” [audience laughs] “Um, Hagh-hen…” “India is a part of Asia.” “Do better.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Ash-league… [audience laughs] …no the fuck it’s not.” “There’s Indians and there’s Asians.” [audience laughing and whooping] “And we don’t fuck with each other.” [audience laughs] “In fact, Ashley-egg… you can’t stop Asian hate because Asians all hate…” [woman] Each other! “…each other,” thank you! “Furthermore, Ashleg-ha… here’s a dirty little secret.” “White people… [scoffs] …you’re not even the best at racism.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Wait, no, don’t get me wrong, they had a lot of hits. They had some bangers, right? Slavery, Jim Crow. Just, mwah, classics. But… But… some new teams have emerged to compete for the title. [audience laughs] See, now this is important. Fact-check me here. See, when white people are racist, they’re racist against people that don’t look like them. [audience laughs] Which is wrong. But it kind of makes sense. Asian people? [audience laughs] We hate people who look exactly fucking like us.\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\nIn fact… if you touch countries with us… [laughs maniacally] …we hate you even more! It’s fucking crazy. Look at us, right? Hindustanis, Indians. Who do we shit on?\\n[man] Pakistanis!\\nPakistanis, right? Pakistanis. You shit on Bengalis. Bengalis, you shit on Sri Lankans. Sri Lankans shit on Nepalese people. That’s just the hairy Asians. [audience laughs] Let’s talk about the hairless Asians, shall we? They’re here. Let’s talk about them. Let’s air it out. Let’s say what we can’t say at the DEI meeting. Let’s just get it out, right? Right? Chinese people. Yes! You shit on Koreans, right? Koreans shit on Japanese people. Japanese people shit back on Koreans. Both of those people shit on Chinese people. Meanwhile, Taiwan and Tibet, they’re like, “Hey!” “What about us?” And China’s like, “Shut the fuck up.” “You don’t even exist.” [laughs] Oh. Oh. You think Fox News dads are the problem? You think Ian’s dad is the problem? [laughs] Really? Try talking race relations with an Indian or Chinese father. Try asking this Indian uncle what he thinks of Black people. Oh, fuck!\\nOh, ho-ho! Oh!\\n[audience exclaiming] Enter the 36 chambers of fucking insanity. Try… [laughs] He’ll be like, “The phones are locked, right?” It’ll be fucking crazy. Try explaining George Floyd to an Indian dad. Oh, I did. Oh, we all did. June, 2020. I’m upstairs in Sacramento, in my childhood bedroom. My dad runs into my bedroom panting. “Oh my God, Hasan, are you watching the news?” “Why is Target on fire?” [audience laughs] This was his line. Target is ablaze. The civil war has begun. Where will I get my towels to hang over my Peloton? [audience cheering and whooping] And I was like, “Dad, stop it.” This is an important moment in our nation’s history. For the first time in 40 years, Beige-istan has been asked to pick a team.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd we have to pick a team tonight. My dad’s like, “What are the teams?” [audience laughs] I’m like, “All right, Dad, sit down.” This is important. Let me just explain this to you. [sighs] All right, Dad, there’s two teams. All right? So there’s Black Lives Matter. All right? Black people are saying, “Hey, treat us like human beings.” Then there’s All Lives Matter. And they’re like, “Hey.” “No!” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] Those are the teams. Which team do you wanna pick? And he’s like, “Hasan, both of these people are idiots.” No one matters. [audience laughing and whooping] What? “What’s your GPA? I’ll tell you if you matter.” I mean, this dude is fucking Thanos. I go, “Dad, never say this in public. Don’t go to work and say this.” “We live in America.” “This is a multiracial democracy, Dad, all right?” “We’re trying to unspool the vestiges of white supremacy.” He’s like, “Hasan, white supremacy isn’t real.” “Don’t let them colonize your mind, man.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Come to my office.” You know, every dad has an office. It’s just some room in the house with dusty filing cabinets and a Windows 95 CD-ROM drive. He goes, “Hey, come sit before my Compaq Presario that I’ve had for the past 28 years.” “Sit here. I have to teach you a lesson.” My dad, on his computer, has pulled up a PDF of the US census. It is queued up to income by ethnicity. He’s like, “Read it.” [speaks in Urdu] Okay. These are the highest earners by ethnicity. Number one. Indian Americans. [audience cheering] Average dual, median income, $120,000 per year. [man] Wow. I know, that’s nothing in the Bay. [audience laughs] [laughs] I heard a guy, “Wow.” Number two. Distant second. [audience laughs] Whites. Parentheses, non-Hispanics.\\n[audience laughs]\\nRacist. Yo, the US government is so racist. They’re like, “None of you light-skinned, Bad Bunny-looking Latinos.” “None of you Ricky Martin, Pau Gasol-looking Latins.” “We want purebred, Viking, Mayflower white.” Average dual, median income, $76,000 per year. My dad goes, “Hasan, you see that?” [audience laughs] “Ha. Even on their best day, the white man is three-fifths of an Indian.” [audience cheering and whooping] [laughs] I know. Yo! Bars, Dad. Fucking bars. Up top, Pops. Up top. He’s like, “Now look how much Jews make.” I’m like, “No, no, no. I’m not doing that.” “Come on, man. It’s for research.” I go, “That sounds worse.” Don’t say it’s for research. But that’s my dad. He’s Mufasa, I’m Simba. He lives within me.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd now I have a four-year-old son. I can’t teach him that. [laughs] I can’t be like, “Hey, son, no one matters.” Mwah! “Go live your life.” [audience laughs] “Life is nothing but an elephant graveyard.” I can’t do that. I remember I was back home in Sacramento. I was visiting my parents because they have diabetes. [audience laughs] This is a powerful moment in my life. Because I have two children now. I have my kids and I have my parents. [audience laughs] I’m sitting in between. We’re sitting on the couch. Seventy-four-year-old dad. Four-year-old son. I’m in the middle. And they’re both just screaming into their iPads. [audience laughs] They’re like, “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” “It’s not working!” Right? I’m like, “I’m here, don’t you cry.” “Don’t you cry.” [speaks in Urdu] “Don’t you cry. I’m here.” I’m the halftime show. I have to figure out, what am I taking from this old man and passing on to my son? What is some shit I got to delete?\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s our biggest challenge, right? How do we break generational trauma? We have to figure out, what’s an heirloom that we take from our past and pass on? And what is some baggage we gotta leave at Goodwill? [audience laughs] Because our parents, they fucked us up. They gave us a lot of baggage. But at the same time, there’s a lot of beautiful heirlooms that our parents gave us in Beige-istan that we took for granted. Uncle, we took this for granted. Here’s something you gave your children that they took for granted. No matter how bad you fuck up in Beige-istan, tax evasion, fraud, stand-up comedy… [audience laughs] …you can always go home. In fact…\\n[audience cheering and whooping]\\n…our parents’ greatest dream would be if we never left home. I’m almost 40 years old. I have a wife, I have two kids. My mom’s greatest dream would be if I moved back upstairs to my childhood bedroom. Just quietly having an orgasm underneath the Scottie Pippen poster, just… Just, “Oh, babe, keep it down.” “Sweetheart, my mom’s downstairs. Just be quiet.” My mom would be thrilled. “Wow, my son is climaxing under Toy Story sheets.” “This is what I always wanted.” “Our khandan is together.” She would come in with sliced fruit, just… “Kids, do you want apples?” I’d be like, “Mom!” [audience laughs] “I told you, I like peanut butter!” [audience laughs] “Bring me peanut butter!” But Ritz-cracker Americans? Purebred capital-A Americans? No, no, no, no, no. Zero to eighteen, you get to live at home. The day you turn 18… I’ve been to the graduation party. Dad gets on the mic. “Travis!” “Ha, ha. Happy graduation, bud.” “Get the fuck out of my house!”\\n[audience whooping]\\n“The next time you walk through that door, you better PayPal me, bitch.” I mean, this… [audience laughs] This is why there’s so many homeless people in America. None of these people can go home. [audience laughs] Oh, are you getting uptight? You getting uptight? Really? Really? Let me ask you a question, San Jose. Have you ever seen an Indian homeless person in America? [audience cheering and whooping] Huh? No. Hey, I’ll bet you a Kia Carnival. [audience laughs] Let’s go to the worst part of the Bay… Let’s go to the Tenderloin tonight, all right? Just imagine seeing a 5’7″ bespeckled Indian man. Cardboard cutout, “Hungry, homeless.” “I need help.” You’d be like, “Rajif?” [audience laughs] “Go home.” [audience laughs] “Come home. Live… What are you doing? Get in the car.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, to be fair. To be fair… There are a lot of Indian homeless people in India. [audience laughs] There’s like a lot. They’ve won the Oscar, they made documentaries, it’s crazy. [laughs]\\nWhere’s your family from originally?\\nBangalore.\\nBangalore? Ever been back?\\nYeah. You remember when you go back to the motherland, back to Beige-istan, and you’re sitting in the rickshaw with your mom the first time.\\nRight? 17, you’re young.\\nThey walk up… Yeah, then the kid with one arm walks up to the… Starts banging on the window with the stub, just… “Madam! Madam!” “Please, madam, please!” [speaks in Urdu] “Give me one rupee, please.” Then your mom, she’s a piece of shit. She goes, “Don’t look at them!” “Don’t you look at them. They’ll steal your soul!” “Don’t look at them!” And she goes, “I’m sorry!” “I’m sorry, I don’t have any money. I have to buy jewelry.” [audience laughs] “I have to buy bangles. Do you understand?” “See, bangles, they go on your arms.” “But you don’t have any arms, so you wouldn’t understand.” [audience laughs] “And me getting bangles is more important than you eating.” Am I lying? Am I lying? Go into any Desi woman’s closet. That shit is like the cave scene from Aladdin, just… “Touch nothing but the lamp.” I mean, auntie, look at you. Just fucking bedazzled. You just robbed pirates. Look, just… Ah! Just fucking rapper bling. [audience laughs] You know all those kids, right?\\n[boy] Huh?\\nYou know, when you sit in the rickshaw. And all those kids surround your car like The Walking Dead? [hisses] Right? [audience laughs] They’re all related. They’re all family. That’s what I want for my kids. [audience laughs] I’m not giving them shit. I want them to beg as a family. [audience laughs] But they can live with me. That I will allow. Mi casa, su casa. Come and go as you please. No boundaries. We don’t believe in boundaries. [audience laughs] [laughs] Okay, let me ask you a question. Watch me hit this… This is a Tim Duncan bank shot. Watch me land this joke perfect. Okay? I’m 38. He’s 17, right?\\nWhat’s your name?\\nSunaad.\\nWhat’s that?\\nSunaad. Sunaad? Watch this. Sunaad, growing up, could you close your bedroom door and then lock the bedroom? Of course not! This is what I’m talking about! No! If I… [audience cheering and whooping] If I locked my bedroom door, that shit would turn into The Shining within sec… “Hey! Hey! Hey!” “Are you watching pornography?” And it’s like… [audience laughs] [audience whooping] I am. [audience laughs] But it’s none of your business. “Never lock the door!” Why? Why? Uncle, why? What’s the logic? Why? Why can’t we… It doesn’t make sense! “Never lock the door.” I tried to explain this to my… “Dad, what if I have to go to the bathroom and take a dump?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Then close the door.” “But don’t lock it.” [audience laughs] “I might have to take a shower.”\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\nYou laugh. No, no, no, you laugh. That’s how much my dad loves me. He’s willing to take a hot shower in my shit fumes. [audience laughs] Just… [singing in Urdu] [imitates farting] That is love. [audience laughs] You wish your dad knew your scent, Ian. But no. No, no, no. In Caucasia, you love your boundaries. “Boundaries!” “Hey, Mom? Boundaries!” “Mom? Hey, bitch, these are my boundaries, you bitch.” “I know I ripped through your vagina to your taint, but these are my boundaries, you bitch.” Not only are you obsessed with emotional boundaries, you’re obsessed with physical boundaries. You literally pick the boundaries for the entire world. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh…” [audience whooping] “Africa, here are your boundaries.” “Asia, here are your boundaries.” “Middle East, here are your boundaries.” “Peace.” No, there’s no peace. [audience laughs] We’re around the corner from the election. What’s the biggest issue that the Republicans are using in regards to your safety?\\n[man] The border.\\nThe border. [audience laughs] A bunch of Republican senators are out here acting like hormonal teenagers. They’re like, “Hey, Mexico.” [audience laughs] “Respect our boundaries.” [audience laughs] Then there’s a bunch of Mexican uncles at the border. They’re like, “Señor, why is the door locked?” [audience laughs] [speaks in Spanish] “Why is the door locked? Esta es mi casa.” “Don’t ever lock the door!” World War III is about to pop off because disputes over what? Boundaries! Boundaries. That’s gonna be the downfall of Western civilization. Sunaad, do you know what our downfall will be? [man] What? Hoarding! [audience laughs] Our parents love to hoard. [man whoops] Everything, just fucking Subway napkins. Ha, ha! Taco Bell fire sauce. Red crushed pepper from Dominos.\\nJust poverty mentality.\\n[audience cheering and whooping] Go into any immigrant household. Go to the drawer next to the spoons. [audience cheering and whooping] “Why do you have six kilos of Parmesan cheese… [audience laughs] …from Round Table Pizza?” “You can take my green card, but you can’t take my Parmesan cheese!” [man whoops] Not only do our parents physically hoard, they emotionally hoard. [audience laughs] Oh, every grievance, every trauma. Right here. Right here. Every time you fuck up, “I’ll remember.” They never clear cookies and cache. [audience laughs] My parents, they’ve been together 40 years. Okay, they’ve been adjacent for 40 years. [audience laughs] I’ve never seen them hug. I’ve never seen them kiss. They’re just planking in their stubbornness. Just, “Fuck you!” “No, fuck you!” “Fuck you!” “You die!” “No, you die, that way I get the house and I can talk shit about you to the grandkids!” I had to have an intervention. I go, “Mom, Dad!” “You clearly don’t like each other.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You obviously don’t love each other.” “So either get a divorce, or go to therapy.” And my dad’s like, “Hasan, I’m not paying someone $200… [audience laughs] …when we can argue in this kitchen for free.” [audience laughing and whooping] And now I’m in therapy. Because I don’t wanna end up like them. But here’s the thing, I don’t think it works. Do you have friends that are in therapy, but they’re still shitty people? All my friends that are therapied up are the most mentally ill people that I know. They’ve just learned fancy words to avoid accountability. I have a friend that still owes me money for a concert. I tried to call him on it. I was like, “Scott, you owe me $350.” He’s like, “I hear you.” [audience laughs] “I receive you.” “But I don’t have the bandwidth.” I’m like, “Dammit, Scott!” Get more bandwidth. [audience laughs] Look, therapy’s important, but it is not a flex. Stop bragging about it. “I’m doing the work.” “I’m unpacking my tru…” I don’t need you to unpack. I need you to change.\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\nYou know what it is? Therapy has to be like a haircut. You can’t tell us about it. We have to notice the difference. [audience laughing and whooping] Listen, man, I’m telling you from experience, I’ve done it all. Don’t waste your money. I’ve done it all. I’ve done all the therapies. CBT. Couples therapy, immersive therapy. Let me just say this, okay? If you go to therapy, you deserve a therapist that understands you culturally. [audience cheering] Because I’ve had all the therapists, okay? I had Janet, okay? Janet didn’t cut it. [audience laughs] Janet, big-scarf energy. Buddha statue. She’s never been to Asia. I was her little anthropology experiment. She’s like, “Interesting, fascinating. This is like a trip to the Orient.” “You know, Hasan, every time we’re in a session and your phone goes off and it says ‘Mom cell, ‘ ‘Dad… ‘ You have this need to pick up.” You go, “boop.” “Why?” “Why?” “Can we talk about boundaries?” [audience laughs] And I’m like, “Janet, shut the fuck up.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nYou guys are individualists. We’re collectivists. How do I get you to understand where I’m coming…? “Okay, Janet, pretend this doesn’t say ‘Mom cell.'” “Pretend it says ‘dog cell.'” “Can I pick up?” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Of course!” I’m like, “What’s up, dog? You good?” “Oh my God, Janet, My dog needs insulin.” “Should I give her insulin or establish boundaries?” She goes, “What kind of dog?” “A goldendoodle.” “Not your goldendoodle!” I go, “I know.” [laughing] Oh! I see the dog people are in their feelings right now. [laughs] Oh, shit. My buddy Prashanth told me, he’s like, “Hasan, do not do the dog material on Netflix.” “Dogs are sacred in America.” “Talk about something less controversial, like the Middle East.”\\n[audience laughing and whooping]\\n[laughs] But it’s not… No! It’s insane. It’s fucking insane. There are… “I love my dog.” “My dog is a member of my family.” You people are out of your fucking minds. “But you don’t… you don’t get it.” “You don’t get it.” “Once you lock eyes…” No, no, no, I get it. The only reason why you love your dog is because you’re never in trouble with your dog. You’re a piece of shit, and your dog is too dumb to know that you’re a piece of shit. [audience laughing and whooping] You love your dog. And you love your mom. But only one of them gets to live in your home. [audience laughs] Oh, ho-ho, but best believe the day your dog is able to talk, and it’ll happen in our lifetime… [audience laughs] …and he’s like, “Hey!” “Why are your pillowcases so dirty?” [audience laughs] You’ll be like, “Chauncey… boundaries.” [audience laughs] [Hasan laughs] What was I expecting? Why the fuck was I listening to Janet give me opinions on how to deal with immigrant parents? We fired Janet. “Janet, you’re out.” “Jithra, you’re in.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nNow we have a South Asian therapist. She gets it. Jithra’s downloaded all the seasons of our culture’s trauma, okay? She knows all the baggage we wanna get rid of. She knows all the heirlooms we wanna pass on. She knows that we’re building a new future for our kids. I remember in one of our sessions, like ten minutes in, she cut me off, she goes, “Hasan, I know what’s wrong. I’m not supposed to, but I’ll tell you.” I go, “Jithra, this is what the fuck I’m talking about!” “You know we love shortcuts.” “Be direct. Talk to me.” She goes, “I don’t know if anyone’s told you this, Hasan, but you’re pretty manic.” “Now, you have something that the eldest child in every family from Beige-istan has.” [woman] Whoo! “The eldest child always has something called, ‘Good kid syndrome.'”\\n[audience whooping and applauding]\\n“The eldest child of the family feels like they have to take care of everybody in the family.” “Oh, Mom needs this.” “Oh, but your dad needs this.” “Your sister said this, but your brother did that.” “Your aunt’s doing this, but your uncle did this.” “And you feel like you have to plug every hole.” “But you’re always one hole behind.” [audience laughs] And I go, “That’s how I feel.” [audience laughs] “You probably feel really anxious around your loved ones.” “I feel so anxious.” [audience laughs] “You probably have a lot of secrets.” I go, “I have so many secrets.” “Dark secrets.” I go, “They’re fucking dark, Jithra.” “Now, if you wanna cast a light on that darkness, we really need to talk about your kinks.” [audience laughs] What? “What are your kinks, Hasan?” We don’t talk about this in Beige-istan. Individual pleasure. BDSM, sadism, voyeurism, torture, humiliation. [imitates whip cracking] Whipping. “What’s your kink?” And I… Acceptance. [audience laughs] That’s all I’ve ever wanted. I don’t want a ball gag.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nI don’t want latex. Just put me in a padded room with my wife and my dad, and have them gently whisper in my ear. “Hey, big boy.” “Guess what?” “No one is mad at you.” [audience laughs] And I will cream my pants. This is my wife’s kink, all right? We’re in a padded room. My dad’s not there. [audience laughs] And I whisper in her ear. And I go, “Hey, babe.” “Guess what?” “When my mom is old and decrepit, I won’t let her live with us.” [audience laughs] [Hasan] Ho, ho! I see a lot of women clapping! Really? Really? I thought we were the good progressives. I thought we support all women. Except my mother-in-law. Fuck that bitch! Really? That’s where our beautiful collective spirit dies. It dies at mother-in-law? Dude, I’m in the session. My wife’s kink is boundaries. I go, “Babe, we cannot have this.” “I know my parents are insane, but we cannot do this.” “Let’s not even be progressive. Let’s be practical.” “If we kick our parents out and our kids see it… [audience laughing] …we might be the first Indian homeless people in America.”\\n[audience whooping]\\nBecause best believe 40 years from now, we’re both gonna be built like gulab jamuns. I’ll have diabetes. Both of our knees are gonna be replaced. I’ll have the CPAP machine. I’ll be 80. Thinking about running for president. Imagine this. Think about it. In 40 years, what if we show up with the CPAP machine and the cane? What if we show up to our son’s door and he’s got a chain on the door? [imitating ragged breathing] Just like, “Oh.” “Oh, hey, Mom, Dad, what up?” [imitating ragged breathing] “What up?” “Son, can we die in your home?” “Oh, Dad!” “Dad, this is a bad time, Dad.” “See, I’m dating this girl from Palo Alto, and we’re in couples therapy, and the therapist says we should establish boundaries, especially with our mothers.” If my son said that about my wife, I would fucking kill that kid. I would run to the car. I’d get a gun. I would blow that fucking door down. I’d go, “Get on the fucking ground, you ungrateful piece of shit!” He’d be like, “Oh my God, Dad, where did you get that gun?” “I got a gun for this joke, you idiot. Don’t fact-check comedy.” “Listen to me, we gave you everything.” “We got rid of all of our baggage. “We gave you every heirloom.” “We still go to therapy. We still fuck.” “You have any idea what you did to your mother’s hips? I love them.” “But you destroyed your mother’s hips, so guess what?” “She gets to die in your fucking house.” “And how many times do I have to tell you this?” “In Beige-istan, we never lock the door.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[“On My Way” playing]\\n♪ Don’t you slow down ♪ ♪ Don’t you look down We’re at new heights now ♪ ♪ All on my feet and my heart… ♪ San Jose, thank you so much.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.”\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!”\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.”\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.”\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!”\\n♪ A whole new world ♪\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.”\\nI’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!”\\nI don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore.\\nI’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.”\\nI can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody.

Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not.\\nI love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it.\\nI love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all.\\nNow, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny.\\nNow, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits…\\nDo you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do.\\nI of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot.\\nYeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it.\\nI once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me.\\nI hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it.\\nI get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday?\\nI had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets.\\nYou guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans.\\nI assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them.\\nI like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end.\\nMan, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing.\\nLast year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.”\\nI never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony.\\nYou. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky.\\nThe other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend.\\nI’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them.\\nYou guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny.\\nI think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink.\\nYou’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking.\\nI’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer?\\nIt’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich.\\nAnd who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.”\\nMy grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on.\\nBut I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.”\\nThank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself.\\nI like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?”\\nNo. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand?\\nNow I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.”\\nThis might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAnthony Jeselnik, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t4 thoughts on “Anthony Jeselnik: Thoughts And Prayers (2015) – Full Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuca 20/02/2022 at 01:56  \\n\\n\\nThis man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAriel 30/03/2022 at 06:11  \\n\\n\\nExcept for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.

Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part.\\nThe, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore.\\nSo February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know.\\nLet me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen.\\nLike, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just…\\nThis is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.”\\nI really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.”\\nThis is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good.\\nSo… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense.\\nSo… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening.\\nTwo years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.”\\nAs the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.”\\nSo I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love.\\nThree weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.”\\nThe point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.”\\nYou could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!”\\nSo we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.”\\nSo… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.”\\nSo we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.”\\nAt this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her.\\nI get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me.\\nThe next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.\\nThank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much!

Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people?\\nI had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit.\\nWe learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud.\\nYou don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if it’s you living another life.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nI mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em.\\nWe live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump.\\n[man 2] No. Boo!\\n“No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense.\\nNobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that.\\nThe White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is.\\nWell, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.”\\nHow’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles]\\nThe whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?”\\nObama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs]\\nYou know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole combo attractor. It’s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes.\\nI saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.”\\nEveryone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it.\\nI watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that.\\nOh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a good cult.\\nSome cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this isn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird.\\nBecause when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike.\\nAnd that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.”\\nThat’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs]\\nI have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses]\\nIt’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom! Go to bed!” [audience laughing]\\nJokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school.\\nMy daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly.\\nDebbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents.\\nSo out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful.\\nBut there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, “An open letter to Jennifer Lopez… Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “Let me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck!\\nThis is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure.\\nIs this what we wanted? I don’t know.\\n[woman] No!\\nNo.\\n[woman] No!\\nAre you sure?\\n[woman] No!\\nWhy are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom?\\nWhat’s happening?\\n[woman 2] No!\\nAre you White Panthers? What is this?\\n[man] Life sucks!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are you saying?\\n[man] Life can kind of suck sometimes.\\nLife can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!”\\nWhen you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit?\\nNo one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’ll do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.”\\nBut I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect!\\nWe’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out!\\nAn American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nThank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys.

[imitates Wicked Witch] “A mystery illness.” “I’ll get you my little Jamie and your little dog Toto too.” [cackles]\\n[crowd laughs]\\nKatt will say 2,000 things that don’t make sense, right? But then say four things that make sense and put “sir” after it. “The glass is half full, sir.

And I’m so glad to see y’all here. I’m so glad to be here. [audience cheers] This is what I needed, man. You got a lot of people that prayed to make sure I was here.\\n[audience] Yes.\\nYes. And I appreciate every prayer, man. Now, what’s interesting is Katt Williams might be onto something. Because it is a mystery. [clicks tongue] We still don’t know exactly what happened to me. [sighs] All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer. Because I needed… every prayer. I appreciate every well-wish, Atlanta. Uh… to the world, I… I can’t thank you enough, even when I see people on the street, and they roll their window down and yell out, “Man, we glad you here.” As I look out, and I see my family and I… see my friends. [clicks tongue] I can’t tell you how good it feels. If you could see it through here… it feels amazing.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nIt actually happened here in Atlanta. A little history, Atlanta, I started doing stand-up comedy back in 1991, right here in Atlanta. So it’s fitting that I came back here to tell you, uh, the story because… what had happened was… [clicks tongue] [sighs, exhales deeply]\\n[sniffles]\\n[woman 1] We love you.\\n[woman 2] Atlanta saved your life.\\nHey, hello. You did. [crying] Wow. Man, please, Lord. Let me get through this. [crowd cheers]\\nPlease.\\n[woman 3] All right, you got it! You got it! [cheering continues] April 11th, I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for a aspirin, and I realized quickly that when you in a medical emergency, your boys don’t know what the fuck to do. And I was like, “Damn.” But I was having such a bad headache. So, I asked my boy, I said, “Listen, I need a… a… a aspirin.” Before I could get the aspirin… [ominous tones play] [clicks tongue] …I went out. [sniffles] [music fades] I don’t, um… I don’t remember 20 days.\\n[woman 1] Oh, man.\\n[audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What they told me was, was that… [clicks tongue]…they took me to the first doctor. And that doctor just gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home. [crowd murmurs] Yeah, I don’t know… What the fuck is that? [crowd chuckles] I don’t know if you can do Yelps… [audience chuckles] …for doctors, man. That’s half a star, n*gga. [audience laughs] You know? “No, he good. Give him that.” Man, what the fuck? But my sister… said, “No.” [woman] All right. Four foot 11… of nothin’ but pure love said that something’s wrong with my brother. She came over to see me, and I was… They told me I was leth… lethargic. And she says, “Get him in the car. That ain’t my brother right there.” My little sister who’s always played the background, now gotta play the lead. [man] Amen. [inhales sharply] They say she drove around Atlanta, sorta aimlessly. She didn’t really know where the hospitals was. But as she was drivin’ around, she came up on Piedmont Hospital. Give it up for Piedmont. [crowd cheering] What’s interesting about it is that as she drove around, she didn’t know anything about Piedmont Hospital, but she had a hunch that some angels is in there.\\n[woman 1] Mm-hmm.\\n[crowd murmurs in agreement] ‘Cause she said, “That’s what we gon’ need.”\\n[scattered applause]\\n[man 1] All right. [woman 2 whoops]\\n[man 2] Yes!\\n[woman 3] Hallelujah!\\n[woman 4] Love you.\\nLove you.\\n[woman 5] Atlanta saved your life!\\nAtlanta saved my life. [crowd cheering] So they tell me my sister took me into the hospital. And this cool white boy, Dr. Schuette… Cool white boy. They say he had on a Laker jersey. Just cool as shit, you know? But… he told my sister some horrible news about… her big brother. He said… “He’s havin’ a brain bleed…\\n[audience murmurs]\\n[Jamie sighs] …that’s led to a stroke.” [clicks tongue] Damn. [emotionally] Me. Me, man. Me. [softly] Wow. Here’s the thing. When you dream about what you want to be in life, you don’t dream tragedy.\\n[crowd] No.\\nYou dream everything is good. “I… I got the life. I got the cars.” “I got all that.” [sniffles] You don’t dream that something would go wrong. But when something does go wrong… you need a sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nFour foot 11.\\n[crowd] Mm-hmm.\\nFull of nothin’ but love.\\n[audience cheers and applauds] [sighs, sniffles] The cool doctor with the Laker jersey, white dude, said, “Listen.” “He’s havin’ this brain bleed that led to a stroke, and if I don’t go in his head right now, we’re gonna lose him.” [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What I was told was my sister fired right back and said, “You can go in his head, but you ain’t gonna find nothin’.” [audience laughs] He said, “Why you say that?” She said, “Have you seen how big this n*gga’s head is?” [audience laughs] My sister made a joke because sometimes you gotta laugh…\\n[crowd] To keep from crying.\\n…to keep from cryin’.\\n[crowd murmurs in agreement, applauds]\\n[cheering]\\nWhat actually happened was the doctor said, “If I don’t go in his head, we’re gonna lose him, and she fired back and said, “You can go in his head, but you’re not gonna find anything ’cause I already talked to God.”\\n[woman 1] That’s right.\\n[crowd cheers] The cool white doctor, named Dr. Schuette, shot right back and said, “I’m a religious man too.”\\n[woman 2 whoops]\\n[woman 3] All right. But I gotta do my job. [woman 3] All right. So, what I was told is that they take me in to operate on me, and, uh, my sister knelt down outside the operating room and prayed the whole time. [woman 3] All right. [quietly] Your life doesn’t flash before your face. It was kinda… oddly peaceful. I say this all the time. I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. I didn’t see the light. [audience chuckles] I was in a tunnel, though. It was hot in that tunnel.\\n[woman 1] Ooh!\\n[audience murmurs and chuckles] [laughing] [audience murmurs] Shit, am I goin’ to the wrong place in this motherfucka? ‘Cause I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the devil.\\nLike, “Come on, n*gga.”\\n[audience chuckles] Or was that Puffy?\\n[audience gasps and laughs]\\n[Jamie] I’m fuckin’ around. But if it was Puffy, he had a flamin’ bottle of Johnson &… No, I’m just kiddin’. [imitating Puffy] “Come on in!” No, I’m just kidding. [laughter dies down] No, I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. [clicks tongue] But my sister… [sniffles] …prayed the whole time. And when that cool white dude… [sniffles] …Dr. Schuette came out, he said, “Well, um, you was right.” “Your prayers are answered. We didn’t find where it was comin’ from.” “But he is havin’ a stroke.” “He may be able to make a full recovery.” “But it’s gonna be the worst year of his life.” [sniffles] That’s what it was, Atlanta. You finally got the story.\\n[man] Amen.\\n[clicks tongue]\\n[woman] Saved your life!\\nSaved my life. [crowd cheers] That’s why this moment is the most incredible moment. ‘Cause you do take it for granted. [sniffles] But I’mma tell you something about my sister, Deidra Dixon, and my daughter Corinne Marie Foxx. [dramatically] They held me the fuck down! [audience cheers] “Nobody sees him!” They cut it all off. [crowd cheers] They held it down. They didn’t want you to see me like that. I didn’t want you to see me like that.\\nI want you to see me like this.\\n[crowd] Yeah! [audience cheers] There’s another reason too why my daughter didn’t want nobody to see me ’cause I was dizzy from the… the stroke. I was so dizzy. So, my head would do this.\\n[crowd laughs]\\nStop… Stop laughing. Laugh. Go ahead, n*gga. I understand. But she says, “They gon’ meme the fuck outta this motherfucker.” [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I was doing that. [laughs] But now I have a better appreciation when I see people out and they doing this. I be like, “Oh, I know what that is. What’s up?” [crowd laughs] “What’s up with you?” “What’s up? Just chillin’.” “Just hangin’ out. What’s new?” I know. It’s fucked up, right? [audience chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles die down]\\n[woman] You look good!\\n[Jamie] Thank you so much. I feel good.\\n[audience cheers]\\nTwenty days I don’t remember. [sniffles]\\nBut on May 4th…\\n[crowd] Yeah? I woke up. [snaps] [crowd cheers] And when I woke up, I found myself in a wheelchair.\\nI couldn’t walk.\\n[audience groans] Couldn’t walk, bro. In a wheelchair, and I was like, “What the fuck is…?” “Why am I in a wheelchair?” I’m just coming out of some shit. I looked at Dave Brown. I said, “What am I doin’ in a wheelchair?” He said, “Foxx, you don’t remember?” “No! Why?” “What y’all doin’?” He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” [clicks tongue] “Dave, knock it off. Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.”\\n[audience chuckles]\\nHe said, “You don’t remember?” “I don’t remember, but I know Jamie Foxx ain’t got no stroke.” “‘Cause I’m Jamie Foxx. Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” “And don’t try to get out of that chair, ’cause you can’t walk.” I said, “N*gga…” [hesitates] “Shit!” [audience laughs] “What the fuck you do to my legs, Dave?” I said, “Dave…” [splutters] “What’s going on, man?” He said, “Foxx, it’s real.” “Come on, Dave, man. That’s a horrible joke.” [man 1] You right! I said, “Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [sighs] [crying] “It’s a bad joke, Dave.” [sniffles] “I don’t get strokes. Come on, man.” [audience murmurs sympathetically]\\n[man 2] We love you, man.\\nI love you back. [audience cheers] [quietly] “I don’t get strokes. I don’t get strokes.” “That’s old man shit, man. I don’t get no strokes, n*gga.” Stop this fucking… prank. [sniffles] [clicks tongue, sniffles] They flew me to Chicago for my rehab. Chi-town. [audience cheers] Right there. They took care of me. Shirley Ryan, right over there. [audience cheering] Took care of me. [clicks tongue] But when I got to the rehab, there was this lady that was all over me. She was all over me, brushin’ my teeth, and… and… and… and washing my face, fixin’ my clothes, pushin’ my wheelchair.\\nAnd I’m like, “Damn…” [mumbles]\\n[audience laughs] “Who is this bitch all over me, man?” “She all over me, n*gga. She all over me, n*gga.” I said, “Dave, is she a fan? Did she see Django? Like, what? Shit.” “Why she all over me like this, dawg?” And Dave says something that stopped me in my tracks. He says, “Foxx, that’s your nurse.” I said, “What kind of old man shit is that?” So, the first night, she says, “Okay. Time for the showers.” I say, “Okay. Somebody put me in the chair, get me to the water, I’ll knock it out.” She says, “No, I’m gonna bathe you.” I said, “No, the fuck you ain’t.” She says, “Well… “I say, “No, no, no.” “You not finna… No. You not finna see this pickle.” [audience laughs] She said, “What you mean?” I say, “Uh-uh. It’s…” “Why?” I said, “No. ‘Cause there’s shit goes along with this pickle.”\\n“I’m Black.”\\n[audience laughs] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “It’s a whole lot of shit goin’ on here with this pickle.” “I just can’t let you see this pickle just on… out the package that quick.” [audience laughs] I said, “There’s something wrong with it. I don’t know if it’s been cold.” Fellas, you know how it is. You don’t ever take your pants off right away in front of your girl. You gotta… pump some oil in that motherfucker. Your girl… Ever pull your drawers up? “Bitch. Hold on!” [crowd laughs] “What’s wrong?” “Ain’t nothin’ in this motherfucker yet.” And that shit be stuck to your thighs. She’s like, “Are you okay?” “No! You got to give me a three count.” [audience laughs] “Give me a three count before you expose my pickle like that.” I gotta… You know… That bitch… Even if we ain’t finna fuck, it gotta have a certain… [inhales sharply] So, I’m sayin’ this to the lady. I said, “You can’t see my pickle,” and she hit me with some crazy shit. She said, “J, you don’t remember, do you?” “What?” “I’ve been bathing you for the past month and a half.”\\n[audience exclaims, laughs]\\n[imitating Katt Williams] I said, “Mystery illness?” [audience laughs] “What the fuck?” She been bathing me for a month and a half. I said, “You been in there?” She says, “All in there.” Goddamn! – “All in there?”\\n[emphatically] “Yes, all in there.” [inhales sharply] Fuck! That affected me more than the stroke.\\nI’m like, “Damn, is my dick dead?”\\n[crowd laughs] “Because I need my dick!” [audience laughs] But, yeah. She said she’d been all in there, and then I asked a silly question. I said, “Well, was I representin’?” [audience laughs] She says, “I don’t know what that means.” She don’t, but we know what that means, right, brother? I’m like, “Fuck!” [inhales sharply] “Shit!” “She’s seen it!” “And I don’t remember her seein’ it!” So it hit me. I ain’t seen my dick in 20 days. So I rush to the bathroom, pull my pants down, look down. That motherfucker had a stroke too. [audience laughs] I said, “Man, what’s wrong, n*gga?” “You tell me, n*gga, what’s wrong?” “What happened?” “I don’t know. The lights went off.” [audience laughs] “You cool?” “No, I ain’t cool!” “Did you see the nurse?” “I seen the bitch. I didn’t do nothin’.” [audience laughs] Uh… [chuckling] [clicks tongue] Then it was the process of the therapist. They’d bring therapists for my therapy, and I didn’t want to hear that shit. I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need no fuckin’ therapists. Why did this shit even happen to me? I’m Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx. So, every therapist that came in, I said, “Get the fuck out.” “I don’t want to do this shit.” I… I… I felt like, uh, Wesley Snipes in New Jack City. When he was at the table at the end and Gee Money would walk up. [as Gee] “Yo, you, Nino.” [as Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] “Huh.” “Is that what this is about? Over a fucking skeezer?” “I don’t give a shit about that ho bitch.” [crowd laughs] [scoffs] “Yeah, yeah.” “Don’t nobody know nothing, huh? Hmm, well, I’ll be goddamned.” “Huh. Hmm. Ha. Huh.” [audience laughs] [as Gee] “If you’d have been…” [as Nino] “What?” “If I’d have been what?!” “That’s what I thought you said. ‘Cause that’s all I got.” “Nothin’!”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n“Now, leave me.” [imitating Gee] “Yo, Nino.” [imitating Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] That’s my movie. [chuckles] Remember the old dude? [imitating Bill Cobbs] “Your soul is required in hell, young man.” “Look at you in here, sellin’ drugs to your own people.” [chuckles, imitating Nino] “Cancel this bitch. I’ll buy me another one.” “Sit your five-dollar ass down…” [crowd] “Before I make change!” [Jamie] That’s my audience. That’s Atlanta! Huh. Yeah. [crowd cheers] I was Wesley Snipes. I was arrogant. “I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need nothin’. I don’t want to see no therapist.” They say, “You got a second chance.” “I don’t want a second chance.” “What’s wrong with my first chance?” What’s wrong with my first chance? So, I was… irreverent. I was… I gave up. [sniffles] Then… I heard in the other part of the room… I heard ’em go, “We need Holly.” [audience chuckles] Who the fuck is that? “We need Holly for this one. Only Holly can get him goin’.” “Holly is the one.” I’m like, “I don’t give a fuck about no Holly.” “She gon’ get the same shit.” “And she comin’ here on that bullshit.” You know them movies, “It’s only one person could do this.” “We gotta get Holly.” I’m like, “Man, bull-Holly.’\\n[sniffles]\\n[audience laughs] I’m layin’ in my bed. That’s all I could do every day. I could walk a little bit, but I couldn’t walk. So it’s early in the morning. I hear, “Get up!” Goddamn! “I’m Holly, motherfucker!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[woman] Oh, damn. I said, “Hey, Holly.” [imitating Holly] “Yes, listen. You gotta knock this shit off.” “This whole Jamie Foxx shit.” “Stop this arrogant bullshit.” “That stroke doesn’t give a fuck about who you are.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker.”\\n[audience cheers]\\n[woman] Go, Holly! “All of this ‘I’m Jamie Foxx’ and this Wesley Snipes shit you’re doin’.” “New Jack City.” “Fuck that city.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, and I can get you there, but you gotta tell me the truth and cut this ‘Jamie Foxx’ shit.” I say, “Yeah, miss lady, I’m good.” “Oh, you good?” “You can beat this?” I say, “Yeah.” “Walk to me now.” I said, “Yeah…” [audience chuckles] [woman 1] Aww. [woman 2] Oh. [man] Damn, bro. She said, “I can help you, Jamie Foxx.” [sniffles] “But you gotta tell me what’s really goin’ on with you.” “You’re dizzy, right?” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” “You’re so dizzy, you can’t walk.” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” She says, “You remember the movie Karate Kid?” I say, “Yes.” She said, “We gonna wax on… [with audience]…wax off.”\\n[audience cheers]\\nI said, “What that mean?” She says, “I’m gonna help you with that so you can go back to bein’ a man.” She said, “Take your right hand, and put it on your left shoulder.” “Your left hand on your right shoulder. Now close your eyes.” And I fell. She picked me back up. “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “I want you to look left, and I want you to look right.” I look left. I look right. I fell. She said, “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “This is it. Look left and look right.” I look left. I look right. I got that. And then she said, “Now, Jamie Foxx, now you got that? I want you to look up and look down.” I look up, look down, I got dizzy. I fell back in my bed, and I said, “Miss Holly, I don’t want to do this no more, man.” “What has happened to me?” [shakily] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “I don’t want to do this.” And she said, “I got 15 more minutes left.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, motherfucka.”\\n[applause]\\n[woman] Holly! “You look left, and you look right.” I looked left, right. She said, “Go to sleep!” [snores] [crowd laughs] The next mornin’… “Get up!” Goddamn, bitch. You gotta get a bell around your neck or somethin’. [audience laughs] She said, “Look left, look right.” Huh? “Look up! Look down!” I said, “Yeah.” “You gotta kill that old Jamie Foxx in order for the new Jamie Foxx to walk outta here.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience cheers] Next morning came, Holly came in. I was already out of bed. “Hey, bitch.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I knew you was coming, bitch. I’m up!” “Knock it the fuck off.” “Left, right, up, down. Get the fuck outta here.” So I got down again, and Holly took me into the big facility, but there’s other patients in there, and I was down in the dumps. She says, “What’s your fuckin’ problem?” “What is your problem? You don’t want to fight?” She said, “Jamie, when you walk in this facility, look to the left of you, people that ain’t gonna get outta here.”\\n[audience groans]\\nAnd I did. I looked… There was a quadriplegic. There was a person in a wheelchair. There was another guy’s whole side was gone. She said, “They not gettin’ outta here.” There was one little white lady. All she could do was… turn this little pinwheel. She said, “What do you think now?” And I wept. Cryin’. I said, “God, to all the blessings, go over there.” [man] Yes. [Jamie crying softly] So, then they called my… my psychiatrist, Dragana. He knew I was going through some shit. He says, “What’s goin’ on with you? Why can’t we just talk it out?” I said, “Dragana, we can’t, man, ’cause I’m angry.” “I don’t know why this is happenin’ to me.” And as I said that, I knew why this was happenin’ to me.\\nIt was God.\\n[woman] There it is. [gently] It was God. It was God. I talked to him different. I was like, “Hey, man. You sure you got the right dude?” He says, “Who’s this?” I say, “It’s Foxx!” “Who?” “Foxx!” “Come on, G, it’s J!” “Foxx! Jamie Foxx.” “The one down here puttin’ smiles on people’s faces.” “Who?” I said, “Damn. You want my government name? Eric Bishop.” [audience laughs] “Terrell, Texas? The one that beat the odds, that got the Oscars?” “The one that got the Grammys? C’mon, G. It’s J.” “Come on, man!” He said, “What’s up, my n*gga?” [audience laughs] You can tell by that phrase alone that God is not white.\\n[crowd laughs]\\n‘Cause I wouldn’t even let the Messiah call me that. That’s how me and God talk. I said, “Damn, man, you sure? Why am I going through this?” “Is it a clerical error?” “Did Peter write down the wrong name? I mean, did you read it wrong?” “I’m not sayin’… I’m just sayin’, you been at this for a while.” “Maybe you just… read that shit wrong, my n*gga.” [crowd chuckles] He said, “No. This should be happenin’ to you.” I said, “What? Why?” I said, “God, look at all these bad people.” [crowd murmurs] “Look at all these bad people down here.” “Shouldn’t these bad people be goin’ through this?” You know what he said? “Those bad people already belong to somebody else.” [audience exclaims and murmurs] “You belong to me.”\\n[crowd cheers and applauds]\\n“Remember when you used to say your grace before you ate your food?” “You belong to me.” “Remember when you played the piano for the church?” “When’s the last time you been to church, my n*gga?” [audience exclaims]\\n[man] Mm.\\n[woman] Mm! But I shot back, “God, I get it.” “But the crime don’t fit the punishment.” [crowd laughs] “The crime don’t fit… I’m serious!” “This is too much on me. I’m still down here. I’m gregarious.” “I’m makin’ people laugh, making ’em have fun.” I said, “But look, what this is doin’ to my family, God.” I said, “Look what it’s doing to my kids.” And you know what he said? “You see what they did to my kid?” [audience exclaims]\\n[applause]\\n[woman] Heavy. I gave you two beautiful daughters. [man] Amen. That was my only… begotten son. [scattered applause] And then I said, “Man, why you bringing up old shit?” [audience laughs] As soon as I said it, I got dizzy. I said, “Okay, okay!” “G, come on, man! Come on. Knock it off, bro.” “C’mon, my n*gga. I’m just…” “Bro, I’m a kidder!” [chuckles] “Bro, I’m joking. Come one, man.” “Let me out this bitch. Come on, bro.” “I’m fuckin’ around, bro.” “Okay. I didn’t mean to say ‘fuckin’.” I’m foolin’.” “Just let up off me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd finally, it came to me. It’s about blessings.\\n[woman 1] Yes.\\n[woman 2] Right.\\nGod blessed me with this talent.\\n[man] Amen. He blessed me with all this money and this fame. And when I forgot about God… [woman 3] Mm! …he blessed me with a stroke.\\n[sound distorts]\\n[gentle piano music playing]\\n[crowd applauding]\\n[Jamie crying] Just give me one second.\\n[gospel singer] ♪ Change me, O God ♪ ♪ Make me more like you… ♪\\n[Jamie] Y’all know I couldn’t wipe my own ass?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[sweet tune fades slowly] [hushed] I couldn’t wipe my own ass. That’s what really got me at one point. I went from Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx to, “Okay, lean over.”\\n[crowd laughs]\\n“Okay, we’re gonna go in there.” I said, “Damn, y’all gotta go all the way?” Damn, this is… Oh, this is fucked. Ugh. I can’t wipe my own booty… Ass. [inhales sharply] I lost everything. But the only thing I could hold onto was… was my sense of humor. I never let that go. I couldn’t necessarily walk that good. I couldn’t talk that good. But I… But I didn’t let go of my funny. I said, “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” So I was always crackin’ jokes to the point to where the nurses thought I was really losin’ my mind. And I was never myself. Never myself. ‘Cause it’s a wellness check, they ask you who you are. For five days, I was Denzel Washington. I was Denzel. [as Denzel] “All right.” [chuckles] “All right, so that’s what you’re tellin’ me. Okay.” “All right.” [chuckles] “You gotta wipe my ass, huh? Okay.” “All right. Okay.” “That’s what you’re telling me. I had a stroke. Okay.” “All right. You gotta wipe my…” [chuckling] Ah. My nurses. My nurses. [chuckles] “So, you’re tellin’ me… That’s what you’re tellin’ me.” “You gotta wipe my…” “Okay, I’m gonna lean over. Okay. I’m gonna lean over.” [laughs] “I’m gonna lean over. Get on in. Okay. You goin’ too far.” “You get your fuckin’ hands off me!” [crowd applauds] “You think you can do this shit to me?!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You’ll be serving tapioca pudding in Pelican Bay when I’m done with you!” [audience chuckles] “You had a stroke, sir.” [with audience] “That stroke ain’t got shit on me!” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For three days, I was Dave Chappelle. [imitating Chappelle] “Damn, it’s crazy!” “I can’t believe I came in, they said, ‘Dave, you gone and had a stroke.\\'” “There’s no way Dave could have a stroke. I was incensed!” “Damn, there’s no way. I’m strong! Said they gotta wipe my ass.” “No way! I’m strong!” “Wu-Tang, n*gga! Pow!” [crowd laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. For six days, I was Mike Tyson. [imitating Tyson] “I’m heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “Hello, I’m Mike Tyson. Heavyweight boxing champ of the world.” “Somebody told me I had a sthoke.”\\n[crowd laughs]\\n[as nurse] “Sir, it’s ‘stroke.\\'” [as Tyson] “No, ‘sthoke.’ I had a sthoke.” [as nurse] “You’re not saying it right.” [as Tyson] “I can say it however I want.” “Because I’m Mike Tyson, heavyweight boxing champion of the world.” “So, I say, ‘sthoke.\\'” “You’re not gonna wipe my ass. Nobody’s goin’ near my culo.” [audience chuckles] “They said I had a sthoke.” “And I gotta fight, and I don’t care who I fight.”\\n“I’ll fight Logan Paul.”\\n[crowd laughing] “I’ll fight Jake Paul.” “I’ll fight RuPaul. I don’t care who it is I fight.” “Because I don’t get sthokes.” “I give sthokes.” “I be sthokin.\\'” “That’s what I be doin’.” [laughs] If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for like five days, I was Jay-Z.\\n[crowd exclaims]\\n[chuckles slightly, imitating Jay-Z] “Last night was crazy.” “It’s crazy. They told me I had an ailment.” “I said, ‘Impossible.\\'” [audience laughs] “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles slightly] “I started… started off in Marcy Projects, you know.” “Dame had an idea.” “Y’know, he said, ‘Well, you do music.\\'” “I said, ‘Great.\\'” “Then later, he came with the clothing line.” [restrained chuckle] “And then I met B.” [awkward, drawn-out laugh] “So, they told me I had an illness. I said, ‘Impossible.\\'” “They said, ‘Are you mad?’ I said, ‘No.\\'” “And then they said I need a bedpan.” “And I said, ‘I don’t do bedpans.\\'” “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles timidly] “And then I shit all over myself.” [audience laughs] [Jamie] “I said, ‘Oh, shit.” “I think I need a bedpan.” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive. Then for three days, I was this dude.\\n\\n\\n\\n[imitating Trump] “There’s lots of great nurses.” “Lots of great nurses. I see the Blacks.” “I like the Blacks.” “They’re hungry. They’re eating dogs.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“They’re eating pets! They’re eating dogs!” “They’re eating pets. I like the Blacks.” “The Haitians. Sak pase.” “Map boule.

Same shit.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I like Kamaya-maya.” “Kamaya-maya Harris.” “I love Kamaya-maya.” “What’s her name? Kamala! Kamala!” “I love Kamala. I love… I love… I love Kamala.” “I love Kamala. I love Kamala.” “She’s Black. She just turned Black. I don’t know where she was.” “She just became Black. She just… ‘Poof, I’m Black!\\'” “This is fine. If she wants to turn Black, she can turn Black.” “I like her because she’s Black and she’s Indian.” “I like that. I like it.” “She’s mixed. She’s Black. Hey, for real, though. And Indian.”\\n[imitating Native American chant]\\n[audience exclaims] [panting] If I can stay funny… [all]…I can stay alive. [crowd cheering] [Jamie clicks tongue] ‘Cause it was touch and go. [clicks tongue] It was touch and go. [clicks tongue] And they told me, uh… They said the first 15 days, they thought they were gonna lose me because my vitals were out of control. [imitates monitor beeping] They said, “We’re gonna lose him.” So it was a 13-or 14-day period where he says, “We gotta keep him calm.” “And we’ve given him every medication. It’s not workin’.” “We have to keep him calm.” “His vitals are so high, we’re gonna lose him.” You know what the worst thing to have when you tryin’ to stay calm in a hospital room? Black family members. [audience laughs] Aka, n*ggas. ‘Cause you know they come in with, “Oh, Lord!” “Good God Almighty!”\\n“Not my baby! Not now! Not now!”\\n[alert beeps] “Ooh, good God Almighty! Please save him, Jesus!” My Black family was goin’ so crazy, my white doctor said, “Hey, we need to keep these n*ggas outta here so he can stay alive.” I’m jokin’. He didn’t say that. Now, you know if I was to say that, that’s what TMZ would report.\\n[imitates news fanfare]\\n[imitating TMZ announcer] “Jamie Foxx said his white doctor had to call him ‘n*gga’ in order to stay alive.” That’s not what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. All right? He actually said, “Get these Black motherfuckers outta here.” No, I’m kidding. But it was real. My vitals were so bad, they were gonna lose me. And… that’s when a miracle happened, and that miracle was working through my youngest daughter. She’s 14. I didn’t want her to see me like that. But she snuck into my hospital room with her guitar. [crowd] Aww. And she says, “I know what my daddy needs.” [breathing shakily] She said, “That’s my daddy.” What’s interesting is my daughter used to carry her guitar all the time with her. And they said, when she was playing, my vitals… went down. The nurses at the nurses’ station were baffled. Like, “Wow, what did they give him?” So they rushed into the room, and she said, “Shh.” [softly] I got him. My daughter used to carry that guitar when she was ten years old. She would carry it everywhere. She carried it everywhere. I was like, “You gonna carry a guitar?” Going to Disneyland, she got that guitar. [crowd laughs] We going to a football game, she got that guitar. Everywhere we went, she had the guitar. But you know what I found out? It was God in that guitar.\\n[women] Yes.\\n[crowd applauds] God was in that guitar. That’s my spiritual defibrillator. [crowd] Aww. [crowd cheering] [woman] Aww! That’s Anelise.

I want to get through this ’cause every time I run into somebody now, that I haven’t seen in a while, I cry. ‘Cause y’all my people. You’ve known me for so long, so every time I run… Especially when I run into my homies. I ran into T.I., I cried. I think he kinda cried… But he was like… [as T.I.] “What you sayin’, my n*gga?” “What you sayin’ with me, partner?” “I pray for you, partner. Period.” “I pray for your partner. I pray for you. I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, partner.” “I prayed expeditiously for you, n*gga.” [audience laughing] But every time I run into somebody, I cry. I ran into T.I., I cried. I ran into Candice Parker, I cried. Then, somehow, I ran into Halle Berry. [audience exclaims] I didn’t cry as much.\\n[crowd laughs]\\n‘Cause Halle just rushed me and hugged me so tight. I was like, “Ooh, Lord, have mercy, Jesus.” “This here is Halle Berry.” And she don’t realize how fucking sexy she is. And I don’t want to blow the moment ’cause it was heartfelt. She said, “Jamie, oh my God!” And she hugged me. I said, “Ooh, oh, my gosh.” She said, “There’s so much I wanted to tell you.” And I said, “There’s so much I gotta tell you!” ‘Cause she was huggin’ me. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Please don’t let me disrespect this moment.” So I had to relay… ‘Cause the hug was so nice, I had to relay to my pickle. “Hey, stand down, n*gga. This ain’t that kind of hug.” He shot back, “Shit!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“N*gga, that’s Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” “Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” I’m like, “Man, don’t blow this for me, my n*gga. She’ll feel it!” “Please!” And she’s holding me. She’s talkin’ to me, this close to my ear. I said, “Goddamn!” She right here in my ear. I said, “Damn!” Know how women pretty like that always have a fragrance you’ve never smelled. That shit… I said… [sniffs] “Ooh, what the fuck is that?” “God, this smells like Heaven.” I said… [inhales] I took that shit in, and she was hugging me. I said, “Oh, God, please. Please stay with me, Lord. Please.” “Don’t let me fuck this moment up.” She hugged, and then she… As I tried to pull away, she hugged tighter. Oof. I said, “Good God Almighty.” [crowd laughs] And I could feel my hips. I said, “Hips! Hips, stop! Stop!” But I did just clench up to let her know I’m there.\\n[crowd laughs]\\nSo she’s huggin’ me, and I’m trying to get out of this moment, and as I’m trying to push away from her heartfelt sexual grip, I tried to push away, know what she did? She kissed me on my neck. [crowd exclaims] And n*gga, I came… [crowd exclaims] …to my senses! [crowd laughing] You nasty motherfuckers. Yo, man, I ain’t finna come like that with Halle. And as she was huggin’ me, “Oh my God, thank you so much.” So Halle, when you see this, please understand what I’m sayin’. You just so beautiful. That’s all we wanna say. Halle you’re beautiful. So she let me go. She let me out of her clutches. I said, “Thank you, Jesus!” But then, I felt a rumblin’. I felt something rumbling. I said, “Ooh, whee!” “I can’t wait.” So I rushed to the bathroom to see what was rumblin’. And I pulled my pants down, and I said, “Oh, shit!” “Somebody back!” [laughs] “Somebody back!” And then I ask him, “Hey, n*gga, what got into you?” Know what he said? “Sometimes, you gotta pop out and show n*ggas.”\\n[intense beat playing]\\n♪ We back!

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all.\\n“The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n“My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”\\n“The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n“Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.\\n“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”\\n“Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n“Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”\\n“Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”\\n“First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.\\n“Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!”\\n“Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.\\n“Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!”\\n“Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending.\\n“Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.\\n“If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n“Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

[audience laughs] [Keith laughs] Oh, I had two strokes, man. Two! Yeah. One more, I’m gonna be Mitch McConnell.\\n[audience laughing]\\nStaring all… [laughs]\\n[audience laughs] I gotta admit, man, the first stroke wasn’t shit. [audience laughs] I’m like, “What the fuck?” “You call this a stroke?” [audience laughs] Now, the second stroke, oh, shit! [audience laughs] “Now this is a stroke.” [audience laughing] Mwah! [audience laughing, clapping] Huh? That’s what I call “different strokes.” [audience laughs] I should be kicked off the stage for that shit. [audience laughs] [chuckles] There’s a lot of different strokes, there really are, man. This woman was on Investigation Discovery. Right? She had a stroke. And became a psychotic killer. I’m like, “Oh, fuck.” [audience laughs] “I gotta worry about that now?” I’m walking down the street, “Oh, shit.” “Oh, shit!” “Am I gonna murder?” [audience laughs] I couldn’t kill a bunny rabbit, what the fuck am I talking about, man? But everybody… every audience I go to people know somebody who had a stroke. Right? But they think they become stroke experts. ‘Cause they tell me, “Come here, man.” Like they selling me drugs or some shit. [audience laughing] “My Uncle Bill had a stroke.” “He took four cups of green tea with a tablespoon of Seemox.” [audience laughs] “After six months, no more stroke.” [audience laughs] You gonna get the fuck out of my face, man. [chuckles] I mean, I did it, I followed…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] It is a pain in the ass, man, this stroke shit. ‘Cause now it’s like it’s weird, man. I was in Philadelphia taking my grandkids boxing, you know what I mean? I was getting ready to try to park the car when a UPS truck drove and took my spot. My handicapped spot. [audience laughs] Now, when you’re handicapped, you become the Handicap Police. [audience laughs] I’m like, “What the fuck? Oh, no, you don’t.” [audience laughs] And I, like, beep the horn… [imitates honking] And I point to my placket. [chuckles] Like it’s a badge. I’m like… [audience laughing, clapping] He goes, “Get the fuck out of here.” Now I’m mad as shit, you know what I mean? I step out my car, close the door and lean against the car. I’m waiting for him to bring his ass back. I’m against the car trying to get my balance, you know what I mean? He gone come, I see him walking. “Come here for a minute.” He come on the right side. “No, could you move to the left a little bit?” [audience laughs] You know what I mean? Eh, ah! [audience laughs] I could do a one over on him, you know what I mean? [chuckles] A little slip and a turn, mmm! He’d beat my ass though, you know? [audience laughs] A lot of people ask me, “What did you learn from having a stroke?” Well, I learned, you know what I mean, to live in the moment. Live in the now.\\nNever… All right.\\n[audience claps, whoops] Never put off tomorrow what you can do today. In other words, if there is someone you wanna punch… [audience laughs] Punch them now! [audience laughing loudly] Knock the shit out of them! You know how many unpunched faces I left out there? [audience laughs] Oh, shit, these strokes is a pain in the ass, man. I don’t like it whatsoever, man, I’m like, “What the fuck?” You know what I mean? I’m brand new at this handicapped shit. I never was handicapped before, I’m brand fucking new. Only problem with that,\\nsometimes…\\n[cane thuds]\\nThere you go. [audience laughing, clapping] [audience whooping] Now, some of you are clapping like, “Oh, yeah, that’s all right,” while some of you are clapping like I’m at the Special Olympics. [audience laughs] “Come on, you can do it!” Mmm-mmm. Oh. [audience cheering] Hurry up, here… [audience laughing] …white girl. [laughs]\\nOh.\\n[audience cheering, clapping]\\nIt’s good to have friends, man. It’s very good to have friends. [audience cheering, clapping] You know, like, being handicapped, it’s my first time being handicapped. I never was handicapped ever. The only problem with that, sometimes I forget that I am handicapped, but I’m such an asshole… [audience laughs] …I find myself laughing at handicapped people. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? I see them walking, I’m like, “Ah!” [audience laughing] [chuckles] They’re like, “Look at you!” “Oh, shit.” “I forgot, man.” [audience laughs] [laughs] Y’all can laugh, don’t worry about me. [audience laughs] [chuckles] Now I got my trusty cane. It’s noisy as shit. You know what I mean? “Clunk! Clunk!” I gotta put tennis balls on the bottom to stop it being so fucking noisy, man. But it just, “clunk, clunk, clunk.” I’m walking through the Village, all the homeless guys are, like, “Who that new motherfucker?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m, like, “It’s me.” [chuckles] But all of a sudden, people think I’m homeless because I got a fucking cane. You know what I mean? An old white guy… I only have to tell what he did, but he’s white. [audience laughs] He shook his… [chuckles] …boxes of pizza at me. “Mmm?” [audience laughs] “I’m wearing a Tom Ford shirt, you motherfucker.” [audience laughing, clapping] “The hell out of my face.” [audience cheering, whooping] Eh? Well, people… [chuckles] Like, they really think I’m homeless, man. Like, this was last week. I’m walking there. Beautiful girl. She smile at me. I smile at her. I’m, like, “Oh, shit, here we go.” [audience laughs] This bitch… [audience laughs] …reaches in her bag. “Are you hungry, sir?” [audience laughs] “Would you like a sandwich?” “I don’t want no damn sandwich, I want some pussy!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nNo.\\nI didn’t say that. I did not say that.\\n[audience cheering, clapping]\\nI didn’t say it. I thought about it, but I didn’t say it. So I took her sandwich anyway. [audience laughing] [laughs] But usually I wouldn’t fuck with anybody, especially the comics. We’re comics. Anybody can mess with an old man. Ah. You know what I mean? I wasn’t voted the funniest guy in elementary, junior high school and high school because I said nice, encouraging shit. [audience laughs] I ain’t standing in front of a class, “Hey, leave the fat kid with the glasses alone!” [audience laughs] [laughs] [laughs] But everybody can mess with me. Anybody. Like, I see… Comics see stuff, we say certain things. We’re supposed to question the obvious. You know what I mean? Like today, in today’s world, man, like, kids, eight, nine years old, are telling their parents how they identify. What the fuck? [audience laughs] I can’t imagine my son coming to me at eight years old, “Dad, I think I wanna be trans.” “Oh, son, we can’t afford that right now.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “I just bought your ass a 60-pack of Fruit of the Loom, goddamn it!” [audience laughs] “We’re gonna try this boy shit at least three more years.” [audience laughs] [audience clapping] Oh, come on, man. That was not a transphobic joke. That was an economics joke. [audience laughs] Now this is a transphobic joke, right. [audience laughing] [chuckles] [chuckles]\\n[laughs]\\n[audience laughs] Well, everybody like, “Oh, man, you can’t say shit like that.” “You’ll be cancelled.” “God already cancelled my right side, man.” [audience laughs] “What more you want?!” [audience laughing, clapping] It’s all that social media shit, that’s the problem. Everybody yapping. It’s too much yapping. Everybody’s fucking yapping and yapping and yapping. Even so-called gangsters are yapping. “Yo, my name is OG Deathtrap. I shoot at the block.” “I pull bitches by the hair!” “If you like what I just said, hit that subscribe button for me.” [audience laughing, clapping] “Hit the subscribe butt…” What the fuck? [chuckles] But how I got over my stroke, man. I ain’t get over, but how, you know, I got through it. My religion. I believe in God.\\nYou know what I mean?\\n[audience cheers, claps] Any religious people out there? [audience cheers, claps] [laughs]\\nWow, that’s, like, 12 people.\\n[audience laughs] What the rest of you do? Go home and write manifestos? What the fuck? [audience laughing] What the hell? [laughs] Nah, man, I choose a religion with the best afterlife program. [audience laughs] Some religions have better afterlife programs. And some religions got real shitty afterlife programs. One religion you got… you get reincarnated and come back here. The fuck I’ma pick that shit, man. [audience laughs] What if I come back a white guy with a stroke, what the fuck, man? [audience laughs] Plus, I don’t fuck with any religion whose worship service don’t produce R&B singers. [audience cheers, claps] That’s for the Black folks. [audience laughs] You haven’t laughed at a damn thing I said so far, lady. Don’t look around, you! [audience laughs] She hates handicapped Black men, I’m sure of it. [audience laughing, clapping] [raucous laugh] What the fuck was that laugh? [audience laughs] [imitates raucous laughter] [continues imitating laughter] I see the Black… It looks good seeing Black folks smiling. You know, usually you go to a Black neighborhood, they be… [unintelligible] …face, [grunts]. [audience laughs] Black folks, we don’t get along, until we’re in an all-white country. [audience laughs] You’d be so happy to see another Black guy, he’d be a rival gang member, “Yo, my man!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs] But I fuck with people, man. Nobody gave me a break when I was, um… when I had my stroke. None of my friends gave me a break. They kept fucking with me, man. I’ll never forget, I went to The Comedy Store, all right? And I go in there, and I’m with my cane, clunk, clunk, clunk. And I drop my cane, and I bent down to pick it up and that bitch, Amy Schumer… [audience laughing loudly] kicked my cane across the floor. [audience laughing loudly] Asshole Chris Rock calls me Stroky Robinson. [audience laughing loudly] That’s funny as shit, man. That is funny as shit! [audience laughs] That’s why I never understood why Jada Pinkett, who’s one of the most beautiful women in the world, got upset that he called her another beautiful woman. Demi Moore is beautiful. But, I know, womens, like, “Oh, no, she got alopecia.” Motherfucker, I had a stroke! [audience laughs] Alopecia is one step above having severe dandruff. [audience laughing] [laughs] [chuckles] That was pretty funny, man, come on. [audience laughs] I remember, like, I… When I had my stroke, I questioned God, man. I questioned God, I… “What did I ever do to deserve this stroke?!” “Oh, yeah, that’s right.” [audience laughing loudly] [audience clapping, whooping] “That time I hit that homeless guy and kept driving, fuck!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Was it the time I robbed those prostitutes?” [audience laughs] Oh, come on, man, come on! You know how many prostitutes robbed me? [audience laughing loudly, clapping] [audience whooping] Especially now! “Where you going? Ah, give my money… Ah, shit!” “At least bring back my cane.” [audience laughs] [laughs] No, but, like I said, when I got out of hospital, I went straight to Popeye’s Chicken, man. You know what I mean? The drive through. I wasn’t supposed to be driving, but fuck it. [audience laughs] That’s why I hit that homeless guy. [audience laughs] [Keith chuckles] Chicken fingers all over the place. [audience laughs] But y’all know, when you go to any drive through, when you can talk real clear, they barely understand you. [audience chuckles] [audience laughs] They got mad at me! [audience laughs loudly] [chuckles] The guy cursed at me. I’m, like, “Can I have…” “Sir, we don’t understand you.” “Well, could you please give me…” “Damn it! We don’t understand you!” And then I got mad. And when I get mad, I can talk real clear.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m, like, “What the fuck?” [audience laughs] “You’re Popeye’s Chicken.” [audience laughs] “You sell nothing but chicken!” [audience laughing loudly, clapping] “Guess what I want?” [audience roars with laughter, claps] “It’s not like you have a variety of shit.” “Could I have the duck ravioli, please?” [audience laughs loudly] “Give me my three pieces and let me get the fuck out of here, man!” I know how I sound, man. You think I don’t know how I sound? I know. You know what I mean? My asshole grandson says I sound like Squidward. [audience roars with laughter] He’s a bitch-ass nigga, man, fuck him! [audience laughing loudly] [Keith chuckles] No, look, man, I love him, but I don’t like him. [audience laughs] He gone come at me on Father’s Day. Huh. “You know you’re not my favorite grandfather, right?” [audience laughs] [audience whooping] And I’m, like, “And you’re not my favorite grandson, asshole!” [audience laughs] He’s an asshole. [chuckles] I want to punch him right in the back of his head Soon as this hand gets better. [audience laughs] He don’t know, man. See, people… He don’t realize that my speech… When I first had my stroke, my… my second stroke, when I first had it, man, I wasn’t able to talk for two years. [audience] Aww… I’m lying, man, fuck it. [audience laughs] “Oh. Aww.”\\n[audience laughing loudly, clapping]\\nY’all dumb, little, old faces. “Oh! Oh, no, oh, no!” [chuckles] [laughs loudly] [audience laughs] Ah, that’s what y’all get for the fucking… No, my voice was fucked up, though. [chuckles] You know, my biggest challenge being handicapped… My biggest challenge, man, is crossing that long-ass street… [audience laughs] …with a light with a countdown on. [audience laughing] “Fourteen seconds, what the fuck?!” [audience laughs] “Don’t you have a handicapped two minutes?” The crossing guard comes, shoots a gun, “Wow, go!” “Oh, shit!” “Fourteen, thirteen, twelve, aaah!” [audience laughing, clapping] Ass-old cars revving the engine. [imitates car revving] Now I’m gonna race with an old woman in a walker. [grunts] [audience laughs] “Ten, nine…” [grunts] [audience laughs] Finally get across the street just to get hit by a Citi Bike. What the fuck? [audience laughs, exclaims] Oh, y’all can laugh at me being hit by a Citi Bike. [audience laughs] But the homeless guy, aww… [audience laughs] [laughs] I was in London, man. Anybody from London?\\n[person whoops]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah. Fuck London. [audience laughs loudly] Some of the lights in London count down from seven seconds. Fast as shit. Seven, six, five, four! Had to go back, “Aw, shit.” [audience laughing loudly] [laughs] [chuckles] [cackles] I was in London for two weeks, I only see one side of London. [audience laughs lightly] I never crossed the street, come on, goddamn it! [audience laughs] When I had my first stroke, right, I remember running to my car to call my kid’s mom, Tracy Rome. My best friend, I called her. But I did so much lying and cheating. She didn’t believe shit I was saying. [audience laughs] I’m, like, “I can’t take you to dinner tonight, I’m having a stroke.” “Mm-hmm.” [audience laughs] “If you’re having a so-called stroke, FaceTime me and let me see that shit.” [audience laughs] [chuckles] I had to call looking… [garbled] “Oh, look at me!” [laughs] That’s a true story, man, true. When I got my… [chuckles] …my second stroke, man, I flew from Newark, New Jersey to Arizona to get laid. [audience laughs] First class. [audience laughs] I’m not gonna have a stroke in coach. The fuck I am. [audience laughing loudly, clapping] What kind of animal am I? [chuckles] Like, if you fly first class you know they give you all the drinks you want. You know what I mean? Never stop. No drink minimum, nothing. Bam!\\nBoom!\\n[audience laughs] Slip-slop! [audience laughs] Slip-slop with 15 drinks in. [audience laughs] I’m drunk as shit. [laughs] I mean, time flew past. The pilot makes an announcement. “Twenty minutes left in the flight.” Okay, I’m doing the math. Twenty minutes left in the flight, ten minutes to the girl’s house, total of 30 minutes… What takes 30 minutes to kick in? [audience laughs raucously] [screaming] Answer me! [audience laughs loudly] Viagra, damn it. I popped the Viagra. Men… [chuckles] …never take a Viagra on an airplane. [audience laughs] I was fucked up, man. I was, I fucked up. You know what I mean? I’m, like, “Oh, shit.” My vision was blurry, I’m, like, “Oh, fuck.” I got an Uber. I start passing in and out of consciousness. [audience laughs] But I never panic… [audience laughing] …when I know I gotta make a decision. [audience laughs] “Should I go to the girl’s house and get laid?” [audience laughs] “Should I go to the hospital and live?” [audience laughs loudly] So I’m knocking on the girl’s door. [audience laughs loudly, claps] [audience whooping] She opened the door, I bust in, take my clothes off real fast. I’m in a rush right now. [audience laughing] I have to beat that stroke, you know what I mean? She’s laying on the bed butt naked. I’m butt naked, I’m walking toward her like the living dead.\\n[Keith groans]\\n[audience laughs] [flatly] “Must complete the mission.” My arm goes down. My leg goes down. Only thing still working? Ha! [audience laughs, claps] I should make a commercial out of this shit. “When everything is going down, Viagra stands strong!” [audience whooping, clapping] Now, ladies, don’t ever let me hear you say again in your lives, “We enjoy sex just as much as you men.” Bullshit! How many of you are willing to die for it? [audience laughs] [angrily] Answer me! [audience laughing] [audience laughing loudly] What have you ever sacrificed, lady? What have you ever sacrificed?! Yeah, you! Would you lose your job for it? Of course not! President Bill Clinton… [audience laughs loudly] [audience claps] …sacrificed the most important job in the world… [audience laughs] …for a slice.\\n[audience laughing loudly, clapping]\\n[audience whooping]\\n[audience members whistles]\\n[chuckles] The only thing that got to me, man, is my son. My son cursed at me for the first time. Ever. I’m sitting in my house in a wheelchair. [chuckles] My son comes over. He was crying, man. “Dad.” [imitates sobbing, chuckles] [audience laughs] “We almost lost you, Dad, we almost lost you!” “All for some fucking pussy!” [audience laughs] And I looked up at him from my wheelchair, I’m, like, “Son, are you gay, what the fuck?” [audience laughs loudly, claps] [audience whoops] [chuckles] “Of course that’s what it’s for, what the fuck?” “How do you think you got here, asshole?” I was in the hospital, and a speech pathologist came in. You know what I mean? And the speech pathologist, her job is to see what you can remember, long-term, short-term memory. But she thinks, and thought in her mind, the louder she talks… [audience laughs] …the more I will understand. She’d come into the room, “Hello.” [louder, in singsong] “Hello!” [loudly] “What is your name?” And I would fuck with her, “Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King.”\\n[audience laughs loudly, whoops]\\n[chuckles] You should see the look in her face, “Oh, shit, he’s fucked up!” [audience laughs] [laughs] And then she would give me these long-ass word math problems. And she was all excitable. “Are you ready?” [audience laughs] “I’m laying in bed with a stroke, I can’t be more ready, more!” “Here we go! Little Billy went to the store.” [audience laughs] “He had 16 marbles in one pocket, $32 in another pocket, and he left the house with four… fluffy… puppies.” [audience laughs] I’m, like, “Come on!” “On the way to the store, he stopped past his aunt’s house.” “He gave her two of the fluffy puppies.” “He continued to the store.” “Unbeknownst to him… [pretending to cry] …he had a hole in his pocket”. “He lost seven of his marbles.” “What the fuck, am I four years old? Go on!” [audience laughs] “At the store, he spent 10.75.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gravely] Oh, shit. [audience laughs] “He got another pack of 19 marbles.” Fuck! [audience laughs] “All he got was the marbles, the fluffy puppies, and the change.” “What did he bring home?” [audience laughs] I didn’t know this shit before the stroke, what the fuck? [audience laughing, clapping] [audience whooping] [unintelligible] [audience laughs] What are you, a fucking teacher, what the fuck? “Now, see, what he did is…” It’s a joke! [audience laughs loudly] Why do you explain to him? [audience laughs] The what? [audience laughs lightly]\\n[woman, unintelligible]\\nOh, shit. [audience laughs] I just fucked up. All right. Why do you explain it to her? [audience laughs loudly, exclaiming] No, I… My vision is bad from my stroke. [audience laughing raucously] [audience claps] H… Hey, little girl… [audience laughing] I use my st… my stroke for an excuse for everything. [audience laughs] The cops stop me for drinking and driving… [chuckles] “Sir, have you been drinking and driving?” “I had a stro…” [laughs] [audience laughs] “What the fuck, is that alcohol on your breath?” “My medicine!” [audience laughs, claps] [chuckles] “Your medicine smells like Hennessy?” [audience laughs] Ah, goddammit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. [audience laughs lightly] I have, you know… [chuckles] I remember when I… Like, when I went to the hospital, the pandemic was first starting. Do y’all remember when the pandemic first started? I know Black folks, we thought, at first, COVID didn’t infect us. [audience laughs lightly] We didn’t think COVID infected us. We were having block parties…\\n[audience laughs]\\n♪ We don’t get no COVID ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat shit lasted for two hours.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI remember CNN, Jake Tapper came on. [imitating Tapper] “Breaking news!” “More Black people die of COVID than anybody else!” What the fuck?! [audience laughs] Why do we always get the worst of this shit? More Black people die of cancer. More Black people die of diabetes. More Black people die from mountain climbing. “Wait a minute.” [audience laughs] “We don’t mountain climb!” “Yeah, but when you do, you die!” [audience laughs loudly, claps] Like, I was in the hospital for two months. Two solid months, man. Right in the heat of the pandemic. You know, when the pandemic hit, your family couldn’t come to the hospital with you. So I was by myself with me and the nurses. [person whoops] Any nurses here? [some whooping and clapping] [audience laughs loudly, claps] The nurses treated me like shit.\\n[audience laughing loudly]\\nAll those hoes are not heroes! [audience laughs] They left blood samples on my food tray. And I’m now, “Fuck, fuck this. Defund the nurses!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] Except her. [audience laughs, claps, whoops] No, man, I got jumped by a pack of nurses. They fucking jumped me! I wanted a room, ’cause I was falling, like, in the hospital, I fall. And they… start measuring my head. Like, “What the fuck you measure…?” “Well, we’re gonna put a helmet on you.” [audience laughs] “I’m not wearing no damn helmet.” “You’re gonna wear the helmet.” “I’m not wearing a helmet!” I mean, how can I harass the nurses with a fucking helmet on? [audience laughs] You know how dumb that shit looks? “Hey, baby, ahh…” Big, dumb helmet, stickers all around it, like… She, like, “You’re gonna wear the helmet!” “I’m not wearing the helmet!” Matter of fact, take me to the bathroom. And she go and throw me a bedpan. A small-ass bedpan. You’ve seen them. Why don’t you just give me an ashtray, what the fuck? [audience laughs] Matter of fact, gimme the helmet, I’ll shit in the helmet.\\n[audience laughs loudly, claps]\\nAnd so I just threw the bedpan back at her. [groans] But I had a stroke, I didn’t have much strength, so she just caught the bedpan midair. [audience laughs] And she goes and tells me, “I don’t give a shit if you poop yourself.” “You better not get out of that damn bed.” I’m, like, “Oh, shit.” She slammed the door, bam! I’m stuck by myself in my own thoughts. I’m, like, “What the fuck?”\\n“Who she talking to?”\\n[audience laughs] “I’m from South Philly!” [audience laughs] I don’t even know what that meant, but it felt good saying it. [audience laughs] [chuckles] When you are in a brain injury unit, they always keep a camera on you. All the time, they’re watching you, they keep a camera on you. You know what I mean? So I looked right at the camera. [audience laughing] And I put my hospital socks on. You know hospital socks. They come with the suction cups on the bottom. The Air Jordan of socks. [audience laughs] I put them on one by one. [groans] [groans] I wanted to get out the bed. As soon my feet touched the floor the alarm went off. Those bitches came running in with pepper spray and Tasers. [audience laughs loudly] And I’m trying to haul ass like it’s a light, “Oh, shit!” “Twelve… eleven…” [audience laughs] “Ten.” [audience claps, whoops] Some fast-ass Jamaican nurse ran me down. [audience laughs] [chuckles] She was strong as shit. Had me in a full nelson, my feet dangling in the air. I’m, like, “Put me the fuck down! Put me down!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] She put me down. When you have a stroke, you get spasms in your legs, spasms. And my leg just kicked up in the air. I end up kicking this Irish nurse right in the gut. Bam! And she’s, “Oh!” “This motherfucker wanna fight!”\\n[audience laughs loudly]\\n“No!” “No.” “Spasms, I got spasms!” “Fuck your spasms!” And she threw a jab at me, you know what I mean? But I used to box, I just caught that shit, bam! She’s swerving, I slipped it, ah! [audience laughs loudly] [audience claps] “South Philly, bitch!” [audience laughs] But I celebrated too fast. Fucking Puerto Rican nurse was next. She came with a lot of movement, you know what I mean? [audience laughs] Like Zab Judah, she… [grunts] She’d fake with the right, hook with the left. Knocked me the fuck out, man. [audience laughs] Before I went, I heard her say, “South Bronx, motherfucker!” [audience laughs raucously] [audience clapping] Wait a minute… [laughs] Y’all ain’t supposed to applaud for that shit. [audience laughs] I was out cold, man. I woke up, I was in the COVID section. [audience laughs] With a helmet on, what the fuck?!\\n[audience laughs loudly]\\nNo, they did put me in the COVID section, man. No lying, I had no symptoms. No runny nose, no sore throat, no coughs. I think they put me there for bad behavior. [audience laughs] [chuckles] And the COVID section was, like, dark. In a dungeon almost. They ran me through the corridor and all that shit. The ceiling was leaking water. [audience laughs] A guy was playing the organ. [audience laughs loudly] I’m, like, “What the fuck is going on?” And they had a big 70-inch TV with CNN on. And at that time, CNN was showing a death count. And you’d see the clicker. Click, click. I’m, like, “Oh, fuck!” “I see my name, ah, no!” [audience laughing] “I’m here!” They put me… in a room and locked the door, man. And those were the worst days of my life, man. It was horrible, you know what I mean? And none, I mean, none of the NOCs came to see me or anything. Nurses of color. [audience laughs] And there were four Black nurses, I’ll never forget, outside my door, talking. “I’m not going near that nigga, he got COVID.” I’m, like, “What the fuck?” “I can hear y’all!” [audience laughs] Well, I’ll tell you what, thank God, thank God for the white “Make America Great Again” nurses. [audience laughs loudly] They didn’t give a fuck about COVID.\\n[audience laughing loudly]\\n[audience clapping]\\nThey came walking into my room, no masks on, coughing, sneezing. I got nervous, I put my mask on. [audience laughs loudly] They snatched my mask, “Oh, get this fucking mask off!” [audience laughing] Kiss me on my lips, mwaah! That COVID section is a bitch, man. It is. The nurse is telling you, ’cause your family can’t come in, they say… And they show you outside. Or your family can only come and see you if something seriously happened to you, they can see you through a window. I can’t imagine… What the fuck? I’m sitting there, I’m ready to go, I see my family give me… [audience laughs] What the fuck is that? [chuckles] Well, man, I did my time, in the COVID section, honorably. Ten toes down. [audience laughs] All right, seven toes, ’cause I had a stroke, and… All right, fine. You know what I mean? I was an honorable guy snitching on nurses. No, when you’re leaving… the hospital, you know, you’re leaving the hospital, it’s like leaving a penitentiary. They give you all your shit in a plastic bag. [chuckles] And the head nurse was admonishing me. “Don’t come back to this place.” [audience laughs] “You better not come back here.” I’m like, “I’m not coming back.” “I’m gonna do better.” [audience laughs] Well, that asshole Puerto Rican nurse, that motherfucker, going straight to Popeye’s.\\n[audience laughs loudly, clapping]\\nHey, man, thanks so much.\\n[audience clapping, cheering loudly]\\n[audience whooping]\\n[mellow music playing over cheering]\\n[cheering fades]\\n[rhythmic music playing]\\n[music fades]\\nIt’s so easy!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nKeith Robinson, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

All right.\\n♪ (SONG CONCLUDES) ♪\\nOh. Thank you so much for coming.\\nThank you for being here. Thank you for watching. My name is Alex Edelman. I’m a comedian, and I’m gonna tell you a story. I’m gonna tell you a story about something that happened to me. But first I wanna tell you about something that happened to this gorilla.\\nOoh. Okay. So there’s this gorilla named Koko. Has everyone heard of Koko the gorilla?\\nYes. Some for yeses. Koko the gorilla, for those of you that don’t know, is a gorilla that spoke fluent sign language. And in 1999, this is true, Koko met Robin Williams. And a couple of years ago, they told Koko that Robin Williams had passed away. And Koko went, “Koko friend, Koko sad.” Aw!\\nYes, which is sad, but on the plus side, how funny was Robin Williams, that even gorillas are like, “This guy!”\\n“He’s unbelievable.” My comedy barely works if you’re not from the Upper West Side. Robin Williams crossed the species barrier.\\nBrilliant comedian. Also, and obviously, did they have to tell… …the gorilla that Robin Williams had passed away? She wasn’t gonna catch it on CNN or anything like that. I heard about this in, like, September of 2017 and I couldn’t stop imagining somebody walking into a gorilla enclosure, just like, “No. I’ll do it. I’ll do it. Let me.”\\n“Hi, Koko?”\\n“Can you put down the banana?” “We have some bad news.” And they tell Koko and Koko’s like… “Oh, no.”\\n“But Prince is fine, right?” Like, “Get the gun. Koko. Koko, calm down.” And Koko’s like, “Why was the last David Bowie album so sad?”\\nAnd they’re like, “Koko!” And Koko’s like, “What else do you know–” And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like… And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like, “Who is the president right now?” Those are the kind of jokes I write. I write jokes that are so dumb and simple that part of it is like, “Oh, I can’t believe someone took the time to think about that.” “I can’t believe that someone thought that was worth informing an audience of.” I can’t believe– This is true sadly, that in the middle of a pandemic, someone spent 500 dollars on sign language lessons over Zoom… …for a joke about a gorilla. I love a dumb joke. I love a silly joke. It’s my job. It’s my currency. I wrote a joke a while ago that was so dumb, it took a month and a half to realize it was actually too dumb to ever grace a stage.\\nHere it is. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fat horse. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a fat horse. Maybe that’s because they get four times as many steps as we do.\\nI… I know, I know. And a month and a half later, I was walking through a Whole Foods and out of nowhere I was like… “Twice as many steps.” They don’t have eight goddamn legs.\\nIt’s twice as many steps. And that’s what this show was gonna be when I started writing it. It was gonna be a show full of benign silliness, like I’ve done my whole comedy life, and then something happened. So, I write radio comedy shows for the BBC. Nobody listens to these things.\\nNo one. People my age don’t even know what a radio comedy show is. Like, I’ll tell people, “I write radio comedy shows.” And they’re like, “What’s a radio comedy show?” And I have to explain that it’s like a podcast, but for the dying. And like, this radio show comes out and there’s this massive wave of indifference, right? No one cares. It’s a radio comedy show. But there are two tweets. Just two. And one tweet’s actually very nice. It’s very complimentary, because the tweet is from my Aunt Nancy in Teaneck, New Jersey.\\nAnd it said– Her fans are everywhere, of course. And the second tweet is from someone I’m not related to. And this guy’s just listened to the show. And this guy’s very upset. And this guy’s very upset, largely by the fact that I… am a Jew. And sometimes people can tell that I’m Jewish because of my name, or my face, or anything about my personality. But this guy’s very upset by the fact that I’m Jewish, and he lets me know, and I make a mistake.\\nI respond to the tweet. I know. And then he writes back and then I write back, and then he writes back, and then other people get involved. And then I go to bed, and I wake up the next morning, and my Twitter feed, it’s just this avalanche of antisemitism. Nothing but anti– And it bothered me. It’s never fun to see that stuff directed at you. And then it stopped bothering me because I started adding these people to a Twitter list. Do you guys know what I mean, generally when I say Twitter lists? A couple of yeses, a couple of blank stares. All right, fine. By the way, you don’t… you don’t need to know what this is. I promise you, it’s an obscure function of a dying platform.\\nLike, you don’t truly need to know. But on Twitter– Yeah… But on Twitter, the way it works is you follow folks. You know that, you follow people, everybody knows. But imagine you’re interested in, like, a common area. Imagine you’re interested in, like, opera or the NBA, but you don’t feel like following a whole bunch of NBA players. What you can do is, you can make a list of NBA players and then follow that list and check it occasionally, right? So I did that, but with anti-Semites. And because of certain issues within the NBA at the moment, there would indeed be some crossover between the two lists. But I made this list of anti-Semites and I like it immediately. I like it for two reasons. Reason number one, let them be on a list for once!\\nOkay? Okay? Even Schindler, not a Jew, we make the list now. And reason number two, these guys got a notification when they were added to the list.\\nAnd the name of this list, and they saw this when they were added, was Jewish National Fund contributors. And I got so many tweets from anti-Semites going, “Take me off your goddamn list.”\\n“I have never contributed to the Jewish National Fund.” And I would always write back, “There’s still time.” “We’re planting a million trees outside of Haifa, be part of the Zionist dream.” And I love my list. I love my list for these two silly reasons, but then I get to love it for a third reason, which is that it’s got all of the worst opinions on it. And that’s one of the reasons you go on social media.\\nRight? You wanna be offended. Right? Same reason you watch cable news. You’re not a moron, you know you’re not getting real news. But you get to be upset. Right? You get to be upset at something someone on the other team did or didn’t do, or something they did or didn’t say. And I have a list. I have a digital terrarium of assholes. And occasionally, with great sanctimony, obviously, I go down the list and be like, “Oh, my God, that’s so racist. Oh, my God, that’s so sexist. Oh, my God, that’s so homophobic. I don’t have any of these opinions. I’m such a good boy.” Anyway, it’s a Tuesday night and I’m doing my favorite thing. When I’m alone, my favorite thing to do is I lie on my couch and I hold my phone like an otter, like an inch from my face. Do you know what I mean? Just a brisk nine, ten hours in a row, just going like this? And I see this tweet from someone on the list. And the tweet says, “Hey!”\\n“Hey.” “If you live in NYC and you have questions about your Whiteness, come to 441, 27th Avenue,” which is in Queens, “Tomorrow night at 9:15.”\\nAnd I saw the tweet. And I thought to myself, I live in NYC. And as an Ashkenazi Jew, I have some questions about my Whiteness. And I’m free tomorrow night at 9:15. And I took a screen grab. I took a picture of the tweet. And I sent it to my best friend in the world, this guy named David Burstein. And I wrote, “David… …do you wanna come with me to this meeting of Nazis in Queens?” And I saw the three dots on the iPhone, that means someone’s texting you back. And then the dots disappeared, then they reappeared, then they disappeared again. And then he called me. And he said, “What’s going on?” And I said, “I’m gonna go to this Nazi bar.” And he said, “Why?” And I said, “I’m gonna listen to everything they have to say. I will learn something. It’ll be fascinating, illuminating.”\\nAnd he’s like, “You’re so brave.” And I was like, “I know, I am so brave.” And the next night around 9:15, I take the subway into Queens, and I get off and I walk to the address of this Nazi bar, and it’s not a bar.\\nIt’s an apartment building. And I thought to myself… “How brave are we?” It was January. It was so– I stood outside this building, freezing, dithering, for like 20 minutes, being like, “Maybe I’m an idiot. Maybe my mouth is writing checks that my butt can’t cash.” And there was one moment where I was like, “Well, obviously I’m in the wrong place.” But I knew I wasn’t. I knew I was in the right place ’cause there was a sign on the front door of this building and the sign just said third floor, but it said it in Comic Sans font, the most radical of all the fonts. And after a while, I sort of rediscover the intestines that I left on the 7 train.\\nAnd I go upstairs… to the third floor of this building. And there’s this long corridor, long, doors on either side of me, overhead lighting, bad. And there’s one open door in this hallway. And when I walk in, the first thing I see in the foyer of this apartment is this older lady. She’s in her seventies, at least, or like eighties, but she moisturizes.\\nAnd like… And she’s got this table in front of her. And on this table is the biggest jigsaw puzzle I have ever seen. A jigsaw puzzle. Here’s how big it is. When I walked in and I saw the puzzle, involuntarily, I just went, “Oh, wow.” And without looking up, she went, “12,000 pieces.” She knew exactly what I was talking about from, “Oh, wow.” And I said, “That’s so much puzzle.” And she went, “This isn’t even all of it.” “This is, like, a quarter of the puzzle. I’ve been working on this part for, like, six months.” And I thought to myself, “You should be further into that puzzle, probably.” Although, maybe White supremacists’ jigsaw puzzles are harder. You know, ’cause, like, all the faces look the same. She’s sitting. I’m standing. We’re making small talk about her tonnage of puzz.\\nAnd like— And she tells me how much like, the puzzles mean to her. And for what it’s worth, I like jigsaw puzzles. And I like people that do them, like, it’s a very, like, thoughtful, fulsome exercise, there aren’t a ton of those left. And it’s even, like, a tidy metaphor for why I’m here, right? Like— Because, as with the world, with a puzzle, you need every piece for a complete picture. You need every piece for a full perspective. If you’re missing even one piece of your puzzle, it is suspect or worthless. But even a metaphorical puzzle, I can do quicker than this lady. Like, she’s making zero progress, and at some point she just went, “You know the last one of these… took, like, three years.” And I said, “Last one?” And she points behind herself, down this hallway. And I follow her finger. And as I go down in, I pass two enormous, framed, framed jigsaw puzzles. Framed. And then to my right, there’s like a threshold. Like a doorway with no door. And when I walk through this threshold, I’m in this living room. And it’s like a… It’s a pretty spacious living room. And there’s, like, a hodgepodge of chairs around, and folks are walking around talking. And of all– Oh, and to my– Sorry. To my left, there’s, like, a big table of, like, pastries and orange juice. And even though I was a little scared, I was like, “Oh, sick! Pastries!” So, I’m eating this Whites’ only muffin. And on the other side of the room… I see this cute girl. And this is how dumb of a moron I am. I saw the girl and I thought to myself with no irony… you never know. You never know, right? You gotta shoot your shot. So, I put down my racist pastry and I went over. And I said, “Hi, I’m Alex.” And she went, “Oh, hi, I’m Chelsea.” And we start chatting and it’s good chat. But a few moments in, Chelsea just went, “Ah! Hey, Alex! The White House! Hmm?” And I thought to myself, “This could go… anywhere.” I actually have a thing for this. I have a thing for this. If anyone ever asks you a question and you know they want a specific answer from you, but you’re not sure what that answer is, there are four words that will save you every single time. Every– Sir, sorry to bother you. Would you mind asking me if I saw the game last night? Did you see the game last night? Oh, can you believe it?\\nWell done. That was very nice. Okay. Very nice. “Can you believe it?”\\nGuys, this works. It’s amazing. “Can you believe it?” It means people’s three favorite things in a conversation. It means I know what you’re talking about, I agree with you, and most importantly, you talk.\\nIt works every single time. By the way, I’m from New England. There is a New England version of this. If you’re ever caught in a stalled conversation with a New Englander, just go, “Fucking Brady, right?”\\nIt works every single time. But this is better? It is evergreen. “Can you believe it?” I have a neighbor in L.A. I never know what he’s talking about. I use this in every conversation with him. He’ll be like, “Oh, recycling!” And I’ll be like, “Can you believe it?” And he’s like, “They should take it out on Thursdays.” And I’ll be like, “Okay.” Or he’ll be like, “Minor League Baseball.” And I’m like, “Can you believe it?” And he’s like, “They should pay the players more.” And I’m like, “Absolutely.” And my favorite one ever, this is like six months ago. He just went, “Hey, Alex, the Kennedy assassination.” And I was like, “Can you believe it?” And he said, “Bobby did it.”\\nAnd I was like, “Oh.” “Well, he got his, didn’t he?” I mean… “Can you believe it?” It is a mirror of a question of an answer, and it works here. Because she just went, “The White House! Hmm?” And I said, “Can you believe it?”\\nAnd she went off on this rant about Jared Kushner.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump’s Jewish son-in-law, and she goes off on how “Kushner and his friends” are ruining the Trump administration and the country. And I so had to stop myself from doing what I desperately wanted to do, which was go, “Oh, I hate Jared Kushner. He sits behind me in synagogue on the Upper East Side.\\nHe’s so goddamn loud.” That’s true, by the way. It’s 1,000 percent true. Kehilath Jeshurun on 85th and Lexington, it’s where he goes. He’s fucking loud.\\nAnd he’s arrogant. That’s the word. He’s so– Like when they call him up to the Torah, he walks up like he wrote it. He’s got a problem, I’m telling you. And– Anyway, she’s off on her rant about the Kush.\\nI’m standing there. I’m nodding, I’m trying to focus more on the face, less on the opinions, you know. And we talk for like 15 minutes. And she does most of the talking, which is a red flag, but not a deal breaker, you know. And after about 15 minutes, I feel someone kind of, like, lurking in my periph.\\nLike I’m being haunted. And when I turn around, there’s this guy standing there. And this guy’s sizing me up with a look on his face that I would honestly most accurately describe as… “This is a Jew!” Like, “I’m pretty sure this is a Jew!” And he said to me, “Hey, can I help you?” As if I was gonna be like… “Yes! Well, I was on my way to synagogue for Yom Kippur! But I got lost and I stumbled in here. Do you know if these muffins is kosher?” But I tried to be neutral and I said, “Hey, man.” And he said, “Can I help you?” And I said, “I’m here for the thing.” And he said, “You’re here for the meeting?” And I thought about saying, “Can you believe it?” But I had just used it, so I said, “Yeah, man, I’m here for the meeting.” And he said, “Chelsea, he’s with you?” And Chelsea just went, “Oh… …we just met, but he seems cool.” And I thought to myself, “Nice.”\\nYou never know, right? And then this guy, like, fumfers for– Like this guy’s not quite sure what to say. But when he recovered, he just said, “Okay. All right. But who is he? Excuse me, who are you? Like, what’s your name?” Here’s the thing.\\nHere’s the thing. Growing up… …I always wanted to be White.\\nYeah, yes. I’m aware there are a few of you looking at me like, “Mission accomplished, buddy.” “Does he not…?” I am White. I’m definitely White. But I grew up in a place where there were different kinds of White people. I grew up in a place where there was a strict hierarchy for Whiteness. I grew up in Boston. I grew up in this really racist part of Boston called Boston.\\nAnd in Boston… And in Boston, there are different kinds of White people, there are different kinds of Whiteness, right? Like, there are Ashkenazi Jews, like me, and we’re in places like Brookline and Newton and an outer suburb way to the south called Sharon, there are the Russians. In Eastie, in East Boston, there are the Greeks. In Dorchester, there are the Italians in the North End. And of course, Irish Catholics, right? ICs practically synonymous with Boston, and they’re scattered all over, but a lot of them very famously concentrate in, anybody know? Southie. Southie, South Boston. Yes. And they’ve had an amazing century. No, truly, an incredible 100 years for the Bostonian Irish Catholics. They’ve gone up a couple of socioeconomic classes as a whole. They’ve had their own president, who was apparently killed by his brother.\\nRight? Like, there’s any reason… But they’ve not ascended to the top of this totem pole. ‘Cause at the top of this pyramid of Bostonian Caucasian, unquestionably? WASPs.\\nWASPs. Exactly. The WASPs. And let me tell you, that is the kind of White you wanna be… …in Boston. You know what I mean? The sort of, like, any country club you want White. Or, like, had a relative on the Mayflower White. Or, like, “I can’t read, but I got into Harvard!” Like, that’s the White you wanna be in Beantown. And growing up, I became so keenly aware of that and I started changing things about myself to appear a little less Jewish. Like, when I was a kid, no one called me Alex. Everyone called me David or David Yosef.\\nMy– My full name isn’t Alex Edelman. My full name, get ready, is David Yosef Shimon Ben Elazar Reuven Alexander Halevi Edelman. That is my full name.\\nI go– Sure. I go by Alex now and my family has noticed the shift. My father’s name is Elazar. That’s the name that he goes by. And he’s like, “You’re not proud of your real name?” And I’m like, “No.” And he’s like, “Why not?” And I’m like, “I don’t know, Elazar. Maybe because it sounds like we’re all in Slytherin.\\nThat’s why.” I have cousins Mikal and Penecost. You can’t even spell their names right in English ’cause there’s no English letter for phlegm. I don’t wanna get into a game of like, “How Jewish are you?” This is how Jewish we are. My brother AJ, or Adam Yitzhak Chaim… …qualified for the last Winter Olympics for Israel. This is not a joke. AJ– I mean, like, it is eventually a joke, but like this… AJ qualified for the last Winter Olympics for Israel. And whenever I tell people that, they always have a few questions. They’re like, “Your brother?” “Yes.”\\n“Your brother?” “Yes.” “Your brother’s an Olympian?” “Yeah.” If you’re wondering, turns out it’s nurture. “Your brother’s an Olympian?” “I know.” “For Israel?” “I know.” “The Winter Olympics?” “I know.” “Does Israel have winters?” “Not really. He had to train in Munich,” in what must be the irony to end all ironies. “What’s AJ’s sport?” “AJ’s sport is called skeleton.” Which is like… Which is like luge but head-first. By the way, my father says on television that I have to inform audiences that AJ is a hero, it’s an accomplishment, and we’re so proud of him.\\nThere. Okay. Skeleton– Oh, are you– No, no, no, no, no. It’s… It’s the dumbest sport in the world, it’s not a real sport, it’s a lunch tray and an icy hill.\\nHere’s… Here’s how dumb this sport is. We went to go see AJ qualify upstate Lake Placid, and this guy from Italy named Cicini, named Jean-Luc Cicini, he crashed at the top of the run, and his little sled went down without him, and the sled on its own finished in fourth place. And I think about that every day, ’cause my brother’s always like, “It’s a skill sport.” And I’m like, “It’s gravity, AJ!” A corpse and some duct tape would medal in this event. You turn on the Olympics and Bob Costas would be like, “Wow, Tom! Look at Simmons keeping his shoulders so still in those corners.” Also, I had no faith in him. No. Like, whenever they interview athlete families, they’re always like, “We knew.” I’m like, “You knew?” “Oh, we knew that Megan was special and she would lead the women’s team to the World–” There was none of that in my house. I made fun of my brother every day. I called him “The Frozen Chosen” for like four years in a row. And then my mom was like, “Stop calling him that.” And this is gonna be too Jewish for a couple of you, but I switched over to “Shul Runnings” and I am so proud. Shul means synagogue in Yiddish. We had T-shirts made. It’s like a whole thing. We’re at… We’re at the Olympics. We’re sitting on this bus from the Olympic village to the venue. And this Israeli reporter was interviewing AJ and he was like, “Adam… …what was it like when you found out you were going to be… an Olympian?” And AJ was like, “Oh, Guri, no one was more surprised than I was.” And out loud on Israeli TV, I just went, “That’s not true.” “It’s not true. I bet my dad 50 dollars that he wouldn’t make the Olympics.”\\nBut he did. He made the Olympics. He’s one of the 30 best skeleton athletes on the planet, out of the 42 skeleton athletes on the planet. And he did it for Israel. And that’s a whole separate kettle of fish, but we are proudly and emphatically Jewish. And it’s a huge part of my background and my upbringing and the filter through which I see the world, but… but… …when I’m standing in this apartment in Queens and this guy says, “What’s your name?” I tell him my name’s Alex, ’cause I’m not gonna give him the backstory.\\nI said, “I’m Alex.” And of course, I said, “How about you, man?” “Like, what’s your name?” And the guy thought about it.\\nHe just went… “My name’s Cortez.” And I said, “I’m sorry, your name is Cortez?” And with a real knife in his voice, the guy just said, “We don’t give real names to people who are here for the first time.” And he looked directly into my face. And I’m trying to look back at him, like not too aggressive, but also not like a coward, and it’s very awkward. There’s like a real moment of tension. But that tension is broken fairly quickly, ’cause this guy just came crossing from the other side of the room and he looked at us, and he just went, “Hey, Matt, we’re starting.” And I was like, “Nice to meet you, Cortez.” And then we start. We start. There was a moment before I walked in where I was like, “All right, if I get scared, I won’t… I won’t try anything fancy, I will leave. I will excuse myself to the bathroom and just go.” But nothing scary is happening yet. People are just pulling up chairs to the middle of the room, and everything’s like a little higgledy-piggledy. But we wind up with like a ragged circle of chairs that doesn’t quite close all the way on the end over here. It’s like a semicircle or like… an anti-semicircle.\\nIt’s… I’m over here. I’m over here. I’m over here. There’s, uh… There are 17 of us, okay? I’m gonna say us. I’m gonna lump myself in logistically. Seventeen of us. Twelve men, five women, including Chelsea, my new love. Chelsea’s, like, two, three seats away from me on this side. This side of the circle, a little bit younger than this side of the circle. But this side of the circle seems to know each other. Much better, a little more engaged, a little more hardcore. This side, of course, has Cortez, my pal. He’s, like, um, five, six seats away from me on this side, jigsaw lady’s sitting next to him, and we start. We start. And for the first 15 or so minutes of this meeting, these guys talked about the royal wedding. Meghan and Harry. It had happened since they last got together, and they were upset about it. And it took me way longer than it should have to realize why they were upset. Meghan Markle’s mixed race. Of course she is. I forgot that. I forgot. You know who didn’t forget?\\nWhite nationalists. They’re very upset. They prefer that he marry a first cousin as per usual. Uh, real quick, I have a connection to Prince Harry, which is that my friend Jack once did cocaine with him in a London nightclub bathroom. All right, that did not get the reaction that I wanted from you. I will sidebar for this. Prince Harry had a cocaine problem. It’s the best thing. We don’t talk about it enough as a culture. It’s in the new book. It’s fantastic. I don’t approve of cocaine, but I love that Prince Harry had a cocaine problem. Because in America, we forget this. But in England, the Queen is on all of the money. So that means at some point, Prince Harry rolled up a picture of his grandmother to do drugs that he bought with other pictures of his grandmother. That will never happen to any of you. None of you can walk into Times Square after this and the drug dealer’s like, “Excuse me, that’ll be 300 dollars.” And you’re like, “Excuse me. Here’s a picture of my grandma at her 50th Jubilee parade.” He’s like, “What?” You’re like, “Here’s a picture of my grandma with Winston Churchill.” And he’s like, “How’d you get this?” And you’re like, “Here’s a picture of my grandma planning the death of my mom.” It only works for him. What are you gonna do about it though, huh? What, are you gonna tell people not to watch the special? Fuck you. What are you gonna do? Just ’cause it’s not in The Crown, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Grow the fuck up. By the way, just so you know, cocaine has no effect on me.\\nNone. Zero. Because I’m part of this generation of over-medicated ADHD children. Do you know what I mean? Like, someone offered me cocaine a couple of years ago, and I tried it, and they were like, “How do you feel?” And I was like, “Like there’s homework to do!” “Do you feel like dancing? We’re going dancing.” And I’m like, “I can’t, I’m putting a bibliography together, aren’t I?” I’m gonna get started on the secondary sources. You fact-check the primary sources. Where are you going? We need 3,000 words on Moby Dick by Thursday. Anyway. They’re upset. And this is a huge group of nodders. Like, if anyone ever agreed with anything, they were like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” And someone’s like, “It’s a disgrace.” And everyone’s like, “It’s a disgrace!”\\n“It’s a disgrace.” And someone else was like, “It represents the sorry state of the West.” And everyone’s like, “The West? What happened to our standards in the West?” And jigsaw lady. Jigsaw– I’m fascinated by this person. Not much for eye contact. Always looking at her shoes, like they owed her money.\\nAlways straight down. But whenever she spoke, you knew who was talking. No one else had a register like this. And at some point, she just went, “Didn’t just happen though, did it? Didn’t just happen is what we’ve come to. This is what we’ve come to. A member of the royal family marrying a–” And then… she uses the N-word. And Chelsea just said… “You know… I’m not crazy about that word actually.” And I thought to myself, “There’s a spectrum of Nazi?” I kept falling in love with Chelsea a little bit. I did, for two reasons.\\nFirst of all, you never know. Second of all– Right? You never know. Second of all, I love romantic comedy films. Right? You wouldn’t watch this? What a great meet-cute for a rom-com, no? We meet at this meeting. She’s played by Anne Hathaway. I like to imagine I’ve booked the role of myself, but if we’re being honest, it’s Jesse Eisenberg or skinny Jonah Hill. And like, we meet at this meeting. And we start dating, and I have to hide the fact that I’m Jewish. And eventually, we start sleeping together, and she’s like, “Why are you circumcised?” And I’m like, “Don’t worry about it.” And, like, things are going really amazing, and I get down on one knee towards the end of the film at the top of the Empire State Building, in the rain, it’s a rom-com. And as I open up my ring box to propose, I lock eyes with my TALMA teacher from fifth grade, and I’m like, “Rabbi Klammer?” And he’s like, “David Yosef Shimon Edelman?” And she’s like… And she runs away. But her best friend, Rebel Wilson, is like, “Girl, you gotta go back to him. He is a good man.” And so we reunite, and we kiss, and the last scene of the movie, we’re married in my parents’ synagogue, right? Like that’s how that would go. You know, on Broadway, I’ve had to explain that to– The stomp to people. So, like, if you guys don’t know, when Jews get married, they wrap a glass up in a napkin and then they crush the glass because the glass represents… happiness. So, you’re just like, bam. Here’s the problem with my rom-com. I date very assertive women. I always have. So, what would really happen is, we’d meet at this meeting, we’d start dating, and then three weeks later… …I would be a Nazi. I’d be standing on my parents’ front lawn in Brookline, Massachusetts, holding a brick, and she’d be like, “Do it.” And I’m like… “Hi, Eema.” “Hi, Mom, this is Chelsea. This is Matt– Sorry, this is Cortez.” There’s so much complaining in this room. That’s the first thing that– There’s so much kvetching in this room. This is around the time they were taking down Confederate statues. Remember that? They’re very upset about that. They talked a lot about how White history is being erased. They’re taking down statues of White people. They’re pulling White people out of textbooks. Someone over here says, “They don’t even teach about White men in public schools anymore.”\\nAnd everyone’s like, “Mm-hmm.” “Mm-hmm.” And White people aren’t just being replaced in the classroom. It’s happening in real life. It’s happening in real life in their own country, in their own country, it’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And what’s enabling this replacement? What’s enabling, as the guy next to me says, “The slow-moving genocide against Whites in America”? It’s this myth. It’s this myth of White privilege. And this myth drives so much of the stuff they hate. It drives diversity hiring initiatives. It drives a popular culture they despise! Despise. And it drives reverse racism, which is when people are racist against White people just because they’re White. And then someone over here says, “It’s the biggest problem in the country today, and no one is brave enough to talk about it.”\\nAnd everyone’s like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” And I can give you two guesses… …at who they blame for this kind of thing. And you might not need your second guess. Because running through this meeting is this thick vein of antisemitism, but I’ve never seen this kind of antisemitism before. It’s almost exhilarating. It’s like thick, Technicolor, weapons-grade, conspiracy-theory level anti– Like, at some point, this guy two seats away from me, he just went, “Jews are sneaky and they’re everywhere!”\\nAnd I was like… “Seems like the wrong time to argue with this guy actually.” “That’s a disgrace.” “That’s a disgrace.” I see myself very much as a Jew. Obviously. But I see myself more than anything else as a Jew. Like when I wake up in the morning, my first thought is like, “Jew waking up.” And not just Jewish religious, observant, thoughtful about what it means in my life. If I was very secular, I’d be a completely different human being. Complete– If I was very secular in a fun, liberal city like New York or San Francisco, I think I’d consider myself bisexual. But because I was raised religious in a place like Boston, I consider myself straight with a couple of secrets. And I remember the first time I was aware of being Jewish. I should have been aware, like, eight days in.\\nBut the first time I was aware… The first time I was aware, I was, like, five years old. I’m at a Chuck E. Cheese at a children’s birthday party in Natick, Massachusetts. And I reached for a slice of pizza that had some sausage on it or pepperoni, something not kosher. And my grandfather was there, and he saw me reaching, and he kicked my hand. Kicked. And he said, “You can’t have that, David. We’re Jewish.” And I said, “What does that mean?” And with a totally straight face, he just went, “It means you’ll never be happy.” And I said, “Be’emet?” which means, “For real?” And he went, “Oh, yeah.” And I said, “Why?” And he said, “It means you’ll never be happy with the way things are. And you’ll always question things. And even when things are pretty good, they won’t seem that good to you.” And I said, “Papa, I don’t wanna be Jewish!” And then my grandfather laughed at me. And he just went… “Sweetie, that’s the most Jewish thing there is.” And it blows my mind when I meet non-Jews, and they say things to me like, “Oh, well, I get it ’cause I used to be a Christian, so.” “Sorry, what?” “Well, I was raised Christian, but a couple years ago, I decided I was nothing, so.”\\nNo– I understand that intellectually. I respect that, of course. But that is not how it works in Judaism. You can’t leave when you feel like it. Judaism is the Hotel California of religions. It is a mailing list, you can never “unsubscribe” from. And I worry that I’m not Jewish enough. I worry that. I– Which is crazy, ’cause to my comedy friends, I’m the most Jewish person they’ve ever met. I’m a beard away from their conception of rabbi. And to my family, I’m Lady Gaga. I called my father once. My father is this lovely, thoughtful professor at Harvard Medical School, religious, wears a yarmulke, a kippah. Every single day of his life. If something goes well, he says, “Baruch Hashem.” “Thank God.” And I called him, I said, “Dad, Abba, I worry that the life that I lead isn’t Jewish enough.” And he said, “Alex, I understand that concern.” And I said, “Do you ever worry about that?” And he said, “Of course. I worry every day that the life that you lead isn’t Jewish enough.” And I am so tough on other Jews. I am relentless with other Jews. It’s my least favorite thing about myself. Like… Like, I was at a friend’s house. I’m meeting my friend’s baby. So many of my friends are having babies or adopting. I’m thinking a lot about adoption, but I’m 34. And I think for adoption, that’s right on the line, age-wise. Right? Like, I think that’s too old. I don’t think anyone is gonna take me at this point.\\nBut like— I’m holding… I’m holding this baby, and the baby starts to cry. Oh, baby’s name is Yasi. My friend’s name is Mati. His wife’s name is Rahel.\\nThese are normal names where I’m from. They are. Those are normal names. And I’m holding the baby, and he starts to cry, which is fine. He’s a baby. But Rahel, who I don’t think’s ever really liked me, just went, “Huh.” “Looks like he’s not a fan of yours, is he?” And I said, “It’s fine. He’s a baby.” And she said, “He actually has a really good sense for men.” And I said, “He doesn’t have a good sense for anything. He doesn’t even know he’s alive yet.” And apparently, never say this to a new mother. I said, “He’s just like a brisket with eyes right now.” And she said, “He’s very intuitive.” And I said, “He’s not. He shits himself.” And the husband, who I’ve known forever, he’s seen enough and he just went, “Whoa! Whoa–” Still calls me David. That’s how long I’ve known this guy. I’ve known this guy forever. And he went, “Whoa! Sorry, David, we’re a little uptight– We are. We’re a little uptight, ’cause people have been judging us for the way that we’re raising the baby.” And I said, “What do you mean?” And he said, “Well, we’ve decide– We’ve decided that we’re not gonna vaccinate until we know a bit more.” And I was like, “Against COVID, you don’t need to. He’s an infant.” He’s like, “Not against COVID, against like mumps and measles and the other stuff.”\\nAnd I was like, “Oh!” “Oh, well, first of all, here’s your disease baby back.” “Second of all, what are you talking about?” And he said, “Well, we’ve read that the vaccines can cause autism.” And I said, “That is not true.” And Rahel went, “What do you know about autism?” And I was like, “First of all, I’ve been tested 11 times.” “You think you get like this without people asking a couple of questions?” I am so neurodivergent. I saw so many child psychiatrists growing up in the Greater Boston area, the last one was free. And I just have, like, one memory. I’m sitting on this brown couch in this doctor’s office, and my mom is outside in the waiting room talking to the doctor. And I just remember hearing her go, “What do you mean, ‘He’s fine?'” And I was like, “Yeah, vaccines don’t cause autism.” “Mati, you know that.” And like, it ends the conversation. He just went, “Well… it’s our opinion, isn’t it? We’re his parents. It’s our opinion.” And I don’t know that I would do this with someone who wasn’t Jewish, but I just went, “Oh, and you guys are embarrassed.” “Right, you’re mortified, ’cause it’s such a low-information opinion.” “‘Cause there’s no basis in science, and it’s so bad for the child, so you probably don’t tell people.” “Something so ill-informed.” And he said, “Excuse me, we’re his parents. You don’t have children. You’ve never had to make this choice. You’re judging us for our opinion?” And I was like, “That’s how we judge people!” “Their opinions and their actions, and the content of their character. It used to be skin color, but someone had a dream.” And he said to me, in Hebrew, in Hebrew, “David, you can’t judge us. Only God, only Hashem can judge.”\\nAnd that worked with me. No, but that calmed me down immediately, ’cause it reminded me how I know this guy. I know this guy ’cause we went to a yeshiva together, which is a Hebrew day school. And in a yeshiva, you study Torah every morning from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., because “yeshiva” is a Hebrew word that means “miserable.” In a yeshiva, when they teach you about God, they teach you that he acts through you. If you are kind, that is God showing kindness. If you’re empathetic, that is Hashem manifesting empathy. In Hebrew, the word is “kli.” It means “vessel.” You are a vessel for God’s action. And so he said to me, “David, you can’t judge us. Only God can judge us. Alex can’t judge us. Only Hashem. Only Hashem can judge.” I calmed myself down, and I remembered that we have this common language and lineage, and that on paper, we’re basically the same person. And I explained to him that it’s possible that God was judging him, but that I was the vessel through which he had chosen to judge him. And we have not been invited back to that house. But it’s worth asking why this guy and his wife, who I have everything in common with, that’s who I go toe-to-toe with in their own living room, I show them so little understanding. In this living room in Queens, where I have so little in common with anyone, I sat there listening to them for an hour. All right. Guys, I sat in a conversation without talking one time… …for an hour, which for me… unprecedented. I couldn’t even nod. Everybody else was like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.” I had to nod at things out of context. Like at some point someone was like, “What it means to be a man in the workplace is changing.” And I was like… “That’s absolutely– Yeah, there’s a reckoning going on. I agree with that. It’s way better now. You can’t just, like, throw your interns out the windows. Mm-hmm.” And someone’s like, “Billionaires and corporations control our elections.” And I was like, “I’d like to see meaningful campaign finance reform in the United States.” “Such a progressive value, isn’t it? Yeah, that’s good.” And finally, I get a chance to talk. There’s this guy two seats away from Chelsea, and his name is Witt. And if such a thing can be said, he’s my favorite. You know how some people can be in their early thirties, but they have a vibe of teenager? That’s Witt. He’s a little blithe and slumpy. And, at some point, he’s like, “You know what’s really hard for us now? It’s really hard for us to reach new people on social media.” And I said, “Do you know why that is?” And Chelsea went, “Alex, do you know something about social media?” And I said, “Chelsea, I know a lot about social media.” And I started explaining this thing called the meaningful content algorithm. This is so interesting. All right, it used to be in the early days of social media, when you logged in, you’d see stuff chronologically. Remember that? You’d see things based on when they were posted. But now when you log in, you don’t see that anymore. You see what the algorithm thinks you’ll enjoy most first. That’s because of this thing called the meaningful content algorithm. And it’s Balkanized us into these social media echo chambers, which has made it so hard for new ideas, or in this, like, one specific instance, the oldest ideas in the world to reach new people. And so I start explaining the algorithm, I start explaining social media echo chambers, I start explaining Cambridge Analytica, the company that’s, like, best at this, and everybody’s listening to me. And, at some point, I looked around the circle, and people have got their arms crossed, and they’re nodding at each other, and they’re nodding at me. And I thought to myself all at once, “Oh, I’m positively contributing to this meeting of White nationalists.” I came as an observer. I’m gonna leave as, like, the “youth outreach officer” or something. But there was a moment… where I actually started to feel very badly for these people. I don’t want to be gratuitous, but these are not life’s winners. Hashem has not given with both hands to anyone in this room. They are not the brightest. They are not the wealthiest. They are very badly informed. And most importantly… …these guys are racists in New York City! They’re racists in Queens, the most diverse borough and the most– Guys, it’s Queens. In Queens, you can’t even get 17 Nazis together without a Jew being sat right there in the middle of you. This isn’t Arkan-ssippi. Are you kidding me? We’re two blocks away from Little Ethiopia. Things are going not well for these people. And at some point, I had a thought, which was so, like… I had a thought that was so self-aggrandizing, it took me two years to tell anyone about it. But at some point, I looked around the circle, and I thought to myself, “Wow.” “Look at me empathizing.” “Look at me feeling bad for these people when they’re so horrible, but I’m such a good boy.” “Am I the hero that we need in these difficult and divided times?” And then I thought, “Do I have a duty as a Jew… to hear these people, ’cause there’s actually something to that?” If you raise Jewish children correctly, empathy is the default. Empathy is the true north for every Jewish value. And all of the best Jewish moments of my life are moments where those values showed up in places you would never look for them. Like, once when I was a kid, my family had Christmas. This is totally true. My mom had this friend named Kate. And over the course of a calendar year, Kate lost her last parent and her last sibling. She had nowhere to go for the holiday. My mom said, “Kate, why don’t you come to our house? We’ll do Christmas.” That’s the kind of person my mom is.\\nMy father… did not want that. Mom is a Jew from Cincinnati. She’s a Midwestern Jew.\\nIt’s a slightly gentler existence. My father grew up Jewish in Boston like me, but in a time when it was so hard to be Jewish there, which is between the years 1500 and 1991. And he said, “Cheryl, I will not have Christmas in a Jewish home.” And my mom was like, “Elazar, we’re having Christmas.” And he’s like, “Over my dead body are we having Christmas.” So they compromised and we had Christmas.\\nSo… Yeah, obviously. Obviously AJ and I come downstairs one day. My parents are sitting in the living room. I don’t know if any of you grew up in a home like this. We were never allowed in our living room. Never. The living room is for guests and tragedies. Those are the only times. And every piece of furniture is covered in plastic, in case the real owners of the house show up one day. We come downstairs, no guests. AJ and I look at each other like, “Oh, no. Bubbe died again,” and we sit down… …on the couch. And my mom just said, “Boys… this year… we’re having Christmas.” And AJ and I were so young and insulated. We looked at each other and we looked at my dad and I just went, “Okay. What’s Christmas?” And my father said, “It’s like Hanukkah.” And my mom undermined him immediately and went, “Yeah, but maybe even a little bit more fun.” Hanukkah sucks, by the way. Hanukkah– I appreciate the politically correct world that everybody lives in where we all pretend that all the holidays are equal. They are not equal. Every– Hanukkah’s very much the Diet Coke to Christmas’ black tar heroin. There is no comparison. No– Go into a supermarket come December. Christmas is everywhere. Hanukkah’s one little nub at the end of the shampoo aisle, there’s Passover matzah in there for some reason. And non-Jews are gorgeous ’cause they’re always like, “Well, you’re so lucky. You get eight days of gifts.” I have never met a single Jew who got eight days of decent gifts. Here’s how it works. You get one gift over the course of the– Like if you’re getting a bike, you get, like, a pedal on the first day, handlebars on the second, then the wheel.\\nIt is absolute bullshit. Anyway, we do Christmas and oh, my God, do we do Christmas. We do the lights. We do the Christmas dinner. My… My mom put up stockings above the fireplace with our names on them in Hebrew and we… …we went whole hog. No hog. Kosher, Christmas. But we decked these halls. Deck! And Kate comes into our house. And Kate… …White. Princess Diana haircut, chunky gold earrings, Hermès scarf, shocking blue pantsuit. White. But she walks into our house like a little kid. Just like… And she starts to cry immediately. And my mom said, “Boys, whatever she wants to do, we’re gonna do.” And we did all this deep cuts Christmas stuff. We strung popcorn together on a string. We ate our way through an entire chocolate Advent calendar in, like, 25 minutes. And we watched Christmas movies. Please try to imagine being a young Jew and you’ve never heard of Christmas, and then on the day you find out about it, you watch, like, seven Christmas movies in a row. AJ and I are like, “Oh, so this holiday’s a huge deal, huh?” And the one that sticks out is the Peanuts Christmas special. Snoopy, Charlie Brown, best thing we’ve ever seen. AJ and I are like vibrating an inch from the TV. AJ’s like, “The meaning of Christmas, Snoopy.” And I’m like, “The spirit of Christmas, Charlie Brown.” My dad’s in the corner, like, praying for lightning.\\nLike… And at some point, a character on the screen just went, “Linus, we need to put out cookies for Santa Claus, don’t we?” And AJ and I look at each other. And we look at my dad, and I just went, “Abba… who’s Santa Claus?” And my father says this didn’t happen. And it is the single clearest memory from my childhood. My father rarely cursed in front of us and maybe he thought we couldn’t hear him, but he looked at my mom and he just went, “Cheryl… Jesus fucking Christ.” And my mom said, “Elazar.” And he said, “Come on.” And she went, “Just do it.” This is a direct quote. This is a direct quote from, like… …twenty-five years ago. My father walked up to us and he said… “Santa Claus, boys… he is a fat man.” “But it’s a good fat.”\\n“But it’s a good–” You know, like, Santa’s an avocado or something. “But it’s a good fat. And he comes down non-Jewish chimneys in the middle of the night and he gives gifts to young Christians.” And AJ and I are like… And AJ just said, “And he’s coming here?” My father’s like, “Sure. I guess he’s coming here.” We put out cookies for Santa Claus. We’re very skeptical, obviously. We go upstairs. We go to bed. We come downstairs the next morning. The cookies are gone. Guys, they’re gone. And AJ and I see that and we lose consciousness immediately. We, like, black out, and I know it’s happened, ’cause there’s home video, and on the home video, we’re going crazy. We’re like, “Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He was here! He was here! Eema, he was here! Dad, he was here!” And, at some point, AJ’s standing on the couch and he looked at me and he just went, “Santa came!” And I went, “Baruch Hashem!” And we ran out to the garage. Why? Because this is the one concession my father got from my mom. He’s like, “Cheryl, I will not have a Christmas tree in a Jewish home.” And my mother was like, “I can respect that, Elazar. We’ll put it in the garage.” And there are two photos of this. Weird photos. We’re wearing pajamas ’cause we’re children, but we’re wearing jackets ’cause we’re in a Boston garage in December, and we’re wearing yarmulkes ’cause we’re Jews. But we’re standing in front of a fully-decorated Christmas tree with a teddy bear wearing his own yarmulke on top of it. And we’ve got headphones on. Why? Because this is how long ago it was. We got cassette tape Walkmen. Remember the square dealies? We were thrilled. That was Santa’s gift. Kate had gotten us her own gift. Kate had pulled my parents aside the night before and she was like, “Don’t worry, Cheryl.” “Don’t worry, Elaser.” “I got your boys Jewish gifts.” My father was like, “Oh!” “Okay, um, Kate, when you say Jewish gifts, what do you mean?” And Kate’s like, “I got them gifts from the Torah.” This was Kate’s gift from the Torah. To put in our cassette tape Walkmen, Kate got us, on cassette, the cast recording of Andrew Lloyd-Webber’s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat… …where the role of Joseph was sung by– Anybody know? Donny Osmond.\\nDonny Osmond, thank you. Donny Osmond. Two photos. Weird photos. Pajamas, jackets, yarmulkes, Christmas, teddy bear, yarmulke, headphones, and on the headphones, an Old Testament story from the Torah adapted into a musical by a British aristocrat where the lead role, sung by a Mormon.\\nIt’s very interfaith. And we go to school that day because yeshiva, Hebrew day school, not canceled for Christmas. And we come home that night and my father gets a phone call. It’s exactly what you think. And the first thing the principal says to him is, “Professor Edelman, your sons have a lying problem.” My father said, “What did they do?” And the principal said, “Well, the teacher tried to explain to the children the very delicate topic of Christmas and Alex raised his hand and just went… ‘We had Christmas.'” And the teacher’s like, “You didn’t have Christmas.” And I was like, “Hmm, pretty sure we had Christmas.” “Lights, stockings, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, meaning of Christmas, spirit of Christmas. Pretty sure we had Christmas.” And the teacher’s like, “You didn’t have Christmas. You had Hanukkah three weeks ago, or four months from now, depending on the Jewish calendar year.”\\nAnyway… …non-Jews believe in this guy called Santa Claus. And in my mind’s eye, I see AJ raising his hand and saying, “We had Santa Claus.” And I’m wrong. The teacher came to the show. I’m wrong about two things. First of all, apparently, AJ didn’t raise his hand. Apparently, AJ lifted two fingers, in the words of the teacher, like he was “ordering his second martini”. And AJ didn’t say, “We had Santa Claus.” Apparently, AJ just went… “We know Santa Claus.” And the teacher’s like, “You don’t know Santa Claus.” And AJ’s like, “Hmm. But we do know Santa Claus.” And the other kids are like, “Who’s Santa Claus?” And AJ’s like, “Oh! He’s amazing. He’s a fat man, but it’s a good kind of fat. And he comes down non-Jewish chimneys in middle of the night, and he gives gifts to young Christians. But… But, last night, because he’s friends with our dad… …he came to our house and he left this Walkman underneath the tree that my parents put in the garage, and he ate all of the cookies.” And the principal said, “Professor Edelman, is this true?” And, apparently, my father just went, “No.”\\n“It… It’s not entirely true.” And Rabbi Falk said, “What do you mean it’s not entirely true?” Then my father said, “Cheryl and I ate the cookies.” “Santa Claus didn’t come to our house.” And my mom says there was a significant pause on the other end of the phone, and then the principal said, “I’m aware Santa Claus didn’t come to your house.” “You had Christmas?” And my father explained. My father explained that this woman was bereft. She had nowhere to go. And he had reservations about it, but he let it happen because he thought it was such a valuable, teachable moment, right, where he could show his children that doing the thing centered in Jewish values, the good deed, may not always appear… conventionally Jewish. Principal says, “Professor Edelman, I understand where you’re coming from but you’re wrong, ’cause what you’ve actually done is you’ve introduced this holiday, that is foreign and corrosive, into your home and you’ve clearly confused your children and perhaps harmed them permanently… …when you’ve given them this holiday. Next year, are you gonna take it away? Will you keep celebrating? What are you gonna do? And more than anything else, this isn’t a good deed. It’s idol worship. It’s the most serious sin a Jew can commit. And you and your wife need to begin atoning for it right now.” And my father, to his credit, said, “Well, clearly, Rabbi, you don’t understand the meaning of Christmas,” and then he hung up the phone. And, look, I love that story. I think it reflects so well on my parents, but there’s such a good question at the center of it, very Jewish one, actually, which is, like, to what do our empathies extend? Is it unconditional? Does it matter who they are? Does it matter how they feel about us? Does it matter why we’re empath– Does it matter why we’re empathizing? ‘Cause, for a while, I was empathizing. In this room, these people feel powerless, they feel voiceless, even if they are 1,000 percent wrong! Those are universal struggles. It’s hard to hate people up close. But once I realized I was empathizing, I was like, “Look at me.” By the way, not just empathizing.\\nConnecting. Once I started talking, I was in the flow of conversation so effortlessly, I thought to myself, “I’m gonna be a grand wizard in like two weeks at this rate.” I’m getting my hood tonight. Like, it’s happening. I keep making eye contact with Chelsea. That’s going amazing. But like— But now my fantasy’s not just Chelsea anymore. Now, it sort of flowered out to the rest of the room. Like, obviously, everybody here’s gonna be a table at the wedding, but like besides that, I’m– No. I’m gonna fix these people. Guys, me. I’m gonna fix them. By the time this meeting starts to wind down, my “good guy” fantasies are like a runaway train. I have spoken more than two-thirds of the people in this room. I am in. They like me. And there’s this guy sitting almost directly across from me, right where the circle gaps, and he’s sort of running the meeting. And, at some point, he was like, “All right, guys. We’re gonna take a break. Anyone who wants to get a pastry, can get a pastry. When we come back, we’ll talk next steps.” And I’m nodding at this point. I’m like, “Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Next steps.” And Cortez, whose eyes have very rarely left my area, just went, “Hold on one– Brian, excuse me. Hold on one second.” And he said, “Alex?” And I said, “Mm-hmm.” And he said, “Where are you from?” And I said… “I’m from Boston.” And he said, “Cool. How long have you lived in New York City?” And I said, “Oh, I’ve been here about nine years.” And he went, “Great. What’s the ethnic origin of your grandparents?” And there was a little voice in the back of my head that just went, “Wow, that third question was so different from the first two questions.” And I was like, “Well, my father’s family is from Poland but my mother’s family… is also from Poland, actually.” And the guy starts peppering me with questions, one after the– He asks me where in New York City I live. He asks me if I live alone. He asks me how much money I make in a year. And, at some point, I got a little offended. And I was just like, “This guy’s got a problem. He’s obsessed with me. Everyone else in this room, they like me. It’s so weird that they’re not stopping him. It’s weird that he can read that.” And he’s like, “Where did you go to college?” And I was like, “I went to New York University.” He said, “What did you study?” And I said, “English Literature.” He said, “Where did you go to high school?” And I said, “I went to a school in Boston called Maimonides.” And he went, “Maimonides?” And I said, “It’s a yeshiva.” Oh! And halfway around the circle, this lady just went, “Oh, boy.” And Witt went, “What’s a yeshiva?” And I said, “It’s like a Hebrew day school.” And Chelsea, looking for any sort of out at this point I assume, just went, “Your parents made you go to a Hebrew day school?” And I said, “Kind of.” And she said, “Why?” And jigsaw lady, of course, not looking at me, of course, just went, “Chelsea!” “So very clearly a Jew.” And because it wasn’t that big a deal, I just went… “I mean, yeah.” “Yeah, I’m… I’m Jewish.” You know… people say that political correctness… is a big part of our culture, but maybe it’s great, because I think political correctness is the reason that after I said I was Jewish, there was a split second where everyone in the circle kind of looked at each other with a real energy of like… “Are we cool with that now?” “Did I miss an email or something?” “I don’t wanna be rude, but isn’t that, like, one of our big things?” And then one person starts to talk, and then another, and then… and then I realized I may have misread how welcome I am. And people are yelling, but no one’s yelling at me. They’re yelling at the guy running the meeting, and I felt a little bad for him. I was like, “They’re not gonna get to the next steps for a while, probably.”\\nAnd Cortez, this guy’s out of his seat like he’s won a basketball game. He’s like, “I told you. I fucking– So obvious. Look at him.” And I look at Chelsea. And as soon as I do, I regret it. She has such an expression on her face. She looks so aggrieved. She has an expression like a shattered and re-glued plate. She looks so upset. And I find it so hard to look at her after that. And this guy running the meeting calms everybody down, no small feat. He’s like, “Okay. Okay. No, I didn’t know.” And he said, “Alex?” And I said, “Mm-hmm.” And he said, “Why are you here?” Which, in retrospect, is an excellent question. And this is my favorite detail from the whole meeting. This is my favorite detail from the whole night. He said, “Why are you here?” And I said, “Oh, I saw this tweet that said if you have questions about your Whiteness, then come–” Before I can finish, Witt, almost brightly, just went, “Oh! That’s my tweet.” “Oh! That’s my tweet,” with a real energy of like, “See? We are reaching some new people on social media.” And even then, I was like, “Yeah, bud, I saw your tweet. And as a White man, I actually–” And I don’t get to finish that sentence. Everyone starts yelling except for– “No. You’re not White. You’re Jewish. You’re Semitic. It’s different.” Someone over here went, “He’s not even a real Jew.” And I was like, “Dad?” And he said, “He’s an impostor from the Khazars.” And I said, “Oh, I– Okay. Well, I don’t know where that is, but I am Jewish and I am White.” And everyone says, “You’re not.” And I thought this would help me. I really did. I went, “Guys. Guys, I know it’s complicated given… …given that Whiteness is largely a social construct… …but I actually benefit an enormous amount from White privilege.” And everyone’s like… “No. No. Are you kidding? Haven’t you been listening? White privilege isn’t real. White privilege is bullshit.” Someone over here just went, “You have Jewish privilege. It’s different.” I was like, “That’s so interesting. I never thought about that before. But actually, I benefit a great deal from my Whiteness.” And Cortez is incensed. He’s out of his seat. He’s like, “It doesn’t exist.” And I said, “Come on, man.” And he went, “Really.” And I said, “I benefit from it.” He went, “When was the last time you got something for being White?” And I said, “Matt, I got a free muffin for it like an hour ago.” I… I don’t wanna spoil the ending of this for you… …but Chelsea and I, we’re not gonna work out. Although it’d be so cool if I could say, “And here she is.” “Come on out, sweetie!” And she’s like, “Ah!” I actually started dating someone. I actually started dating someone a couple months after this. And when I told her about this night, the first thing she said to me, she said, “Just so you know, this is the epitome of White privilege.” And I said, “What do you mean?” And she said, “Nothing says White privilege more than a Jew walking into a meeting of racists and thinking, ‘This’ll probably be fine.'” “Things usually work out pretty good for me, honestly.” “Oh, look. Muffins. Those are for me?” I’ll be out there afterwards, by the way, if anyone wants to ask a question. I answer every question. But obviously, if you’re watching at home and you have a question, I’m obscenely easy to reach on social media. Even if you hated the show, tweet at me. There’s a list I can add you to, you know? And the two questions I get the most are, one, “Were you scared?” Not really. Here’s the thing. Nazis, hmm, far less intimidating than the way that my grandfather described them. Also, they’re not Nazis. But– I hate to clarify a joke, but being a Nazi is actually such a specific thing from an extremely specific moment in history. These guys wish they were Nazis. Like, you ever see kids in the park, and they’re hitting each other with tinfoil swords? These guys are Nazis the way that those guys are the Knights of the Round Table. These are Nerf Nazis, you know? And the second question I get asked every single day is, “Why’d you go?” “Did you really go?” “My wife and I can’t believe you.” “Why’d you go?” Thought I could make it work. It’s my job. I make it work. I get on stage every night, and I am pandering and solicitous. And I hope that it’s enough to make people enjoy the show or tell a friend. Please tell a friend. And it’s gross. And there’s a huge part of me that genuinely walked into this room thinking like they’re just anti-Semites ’cause they haven’t met Alex yet. Haven’t met David Yosef Shimon Ben Elazar Reuven. This… not that different from the meeting. Not for me. I’m only telling you stuff I think you’d enjoy. Right, like, if you really knew me, you might not like me, right? There’d be a political opinion you couldn’t stand, or I’d be too something. I’d be too pretentious, or ambitious, or lazy, or too Jewish, or not Jewish enough. There’d be something. You know who I think about constantly? Robin Williams. A gift for connection no one else could– A gorilla! A gorilla was like, “Oh, my God, the talent is undeniable.”\\nA gorilla! If Robin Williams can make it work with a gorilla, I should be okay with 16 White people in Queens. Trying to acknowledge their humanity with this analogy, but I am aware that in this analogy, these guys are gorillas and I’m one of the greatest comics who’s ever lived. But if you think about it, who gets dehumanized? Right? ‘Cause for a second, I’m in. I’m White. Finally. Right? Childhood dream achieved. And then they find out that I’m Jewish… and the walls go up. But it doesn’t reflect amazing on me, ’cause I wanted them to like me. I was performing. I am always perform– I got kicked out of this meeting, and it bothers me… …on a craft level… …’cause that’s what happens. This guy calms everybody down and he’s like, “Okay. Okay. We’re gonna take that break and anyone who needs to leave can leave.” And even though I’m not amazing with social cues, I was like, “I bet he means me.” And this is the kind of dumb joke the whole show could have been. Everybody else… …gets up and they all move… to the far right corner of the room. And I’m getting my stuff. I look sad now. I look like I’ve lost Wimbledon or something.\\nI’m like, “Oh, God.” “Can’t believe they would do this to the good boy.” And Chelsea… Chelsea. Chelsea crosses this vast expanse of floor to me. And I felt so bad for her in that– I remember thinking, “Man, horrible time and place for you to discover that this is your type.” And she gets to me. She said… “You’re Jewish?” And I said… “Can you believe it?” And for the first time, it doesn’t work. And she went, “So you’re fully Semitic or partial? What’s going on.” And I said, “Both my parents are Jewish.” And she said, “That’s so interesting.” She’s very calm, actually. “That’s so interesting. You know why? Because this is a private residence.” And I said, “Well, I was invited.” And she said, “You were… You weren’t invited. You’re committing a crime right now. You’re trespassing. You can’t be here. This is just for us. Go!” So… So the next morning, call David Burstein… tell him what he missed. And he’s quiet all the way through. He just lets me talk. I talk for like 40 minutes. But when I got to this part of the story, he interrupted me. And pardon the language, but he was like, “And you looked at her and you said, ‘Fuck you, lady.’ And then you looked at everybody else in the room and you’re like, ‘Fuck every single one of you racist, bigoted, anti-Semitic assholes.'” And I was like… “Yeah.” “Of course I put a finger in her face and I’m like, ‘Screw you. And screw– Screw all your little Nazi budd–‘” But that’s not what happened. What really happened is, I got scared by the trespassing thing. And I quailed immediately, and I just went… “Okay.” And on the way out, this is so much worse, I looked at everybody else, and I just went, “Sorry, you guys!” And I left. I left. You know, I had a conversation with someone the day before this run on Broadway started and… and he said to me, “Would you go back?” “A thousand percent.” And he said, “Really?” I said, “Yeah. What, I’m supposed to lock myself in a room with people who agree with me?” “That’s how you wind up like this.” But I get his point, because whenever anyone is like, “Oh, the way to reach these people on the far right or the far left is to extend this hand of brotherhood and connection, and let them know that in the marketplace of ideas, they are welcome–” Like that’s a lovely notion. That’s how I feel. That’s a Jewish value. But some of them want us gone. And when I say us, I mean, us. Like even if you guys aren’t Jewish or a person of color, the fact that you bought a ticket to this show… …I feel bad for you guys. You guys are screwed. See you on the trains. They hate you so much. I’m glad I went. I really took something away with me. Not like a lesson or anything like that. I really took something away with me and it’s very small, but I think it’s significant. And I think it’s significant because it’s one piece from a 12,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\\n♪ (“SECTION 14 ” BY THE POLYPHONIC SPREE PLAYING) ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n♪ And I know there’s a lot Outside the window ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot For you and me ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It takes the sun To make the sidewalk ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It takes the moon To burn my feet ♪\\n♪ Woo-hoo ♪\\n♪ It means a lot To take some time ♪\\n♪ I know it’s right You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n♪ You gotta be good You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot to show ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You’ve got the time to grow ♪\\n♪ You gotta be 2,000 places At once ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be good ♪\\n♪ It seems a lot to show ♪\\n– ♪ You gotta be strong ♪\\n♪ You’ve got the time to grow ♪\\n♪ You got 2,000 places ♪\\n♪ Whoo! ♪\\n♪ And time will show the way ♪\\n♪ And love will shine today ♪\\n♪ And time will go away ♪\\n♪ So love can grow ♪\\n♪ (SONG CONCLUDES) ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAlex Edelman, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 thought on “Alex Edelman: Just for Us (2024) | Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCat Nygaard 10/05/2024 at 01:41  \\n\\n\\nLoved, Loved, Loved this show!!

Stripping away the primal elements typically associated with the act, Novak invites the audience into a cerebral discussion on the subject, humorously dissecting its semantics, cultural perceptions, and the juxtaposition of physical desire with intellectual analysis. Her performance, characterized by self-deprecation, sharp wit, and a refusal to conform to conventional comedic tactics, offers a fresh perspective on gender dynamics, sexual expectations, and the often-comical reality of embodying a “thinking, feeling, desiring body” in a society filled with contradictions. Through her insightful and comedic lens, Novak navigates the complexities of sexual identity and expression, making “Get on Your Knees” a thought-provoking reflection on the absurdity of human sexuality.\\n* * *\\n[“Like a Prayer” by Madonna playing]\\n[horn honking]\\n♪ Life is a mystery ♪\\n♪ Everyone must stand alone ♪\\n♪ I hear you call my name ♪\\n♪ And it feels like ♪\\n♪ Home ♪\\n[crowd cheers]\\n♪ When you call my name ♪\\n♪ It’s like a little prayer ♪\\n♪ I’m down on my knees ♪\\n♪ I wanna take you there ♪\\n♪ In the midnight hour ♪\\n♪ I can feel your power ♪\\n♪ Just like a prayer ♪\\n♪ You know I’ll take you there ♪\\nThank you. Despite… Despite your warm welcome, that journey was hell. [audience laughing] The journey from backstage to a microphone always is. It’s fraught. And it’s ’cause for me what it reminds me of, frankly, uh, is the journey, you know… [audience chuckling] …from someone’s face, down their torso… [audience laughing] …to their pelvis, to give them a blow job. ‘Cause the whole way there, both scenarios, everyone knows what you’re headed to do, but you’re not yet doing the thing, so there’s just this question hanging in the air the whole way of, “Can she do it?” I mean, “Will she do the thing we’re all here for well or badly?” And oh God, the uncertainty, the [exhales]… the tenuousness. I mean… [exhaling] Can you feel it? [audience laughing] I am gonna talk about the blow job quite a bit tonight. “To the point of tedium,” said one early critic.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI think I do it in a way that allows us all to maintain our dignity. Uh, if you’re here with a parent or a sibling, it will be okay. I’m very concerned with dignity. I’m someone that, for example, prefers to call “doggy style” “the Hound’s Way.” [audience laughing] I think the position deserves a term with some gravitas. I think it’s one of our more noble positions. I feel like any of these positions where you’re staring into the eyes of your lover, you know, as if to become one, there’s something immature there, I’m not impressed. [audience laughing] To me, the Hound’s Way, it represents a more mature kind of love, where two lovers can look towards the future together. [audience laughing] You know, it’s not… it’s not sad. It’s not sad that I’m not looking at him, that I’m not making eye contact with him. Because it’s more like… it’s more like we’re these two pioneers headed west. And I gotta keep my eye on that horizon ’cause these are… these are tough times.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckling] But I’m a strong woman. I know hubbin’s gotten from behind. I feel him bringing it up the caboose. I just gotta put my face into the wind and keep on keeping on through this good night ’cause our young nation depends on it. That sort of thing. [audience laughing] I do have a sort of poetic sensibility I like to warn people about at the top of the show because I know it can be trying at times. I can’t help myself. Yeah, I used to write poetry in college. Like many, I gave it up. I grew tired. I grew tired of being in a constant state of enchantment. [audience laughing] You know, just so many hours spent curled in windowsills, just the muscles cramping, the eyes drying out from all that wonderment, just… Every night seeing the moon as if for the first goddamn time. I just wanted to grow accustomed to the moon, you know? I wanted to take moonlight for granted, like other girls.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI hope you’ve taken your opportunity by now just to, you know, take in my physical form. Uh… That is your right, you know. [chuckles] I take the stage, you show up, you get to look, and fair enough. Fair enough. But it is a nightmare, it is a nightmare for an intellectual like myself. [audience laughing] Really to be incarnate at all, frankly. I mean, as a woman of ideas on some level, everything, everything from the chin down feels beneath me. I don’t know what else to say. “Limbs and torso, there she goes.” All a bit common. You know? The female form, this female form of mine, this sort of sack of sex potatoes, you know, this tits and ass that can’t leave home without, oh, an explanation for. “Why would you bring those out if you didn’t bring enough for the class?” [audience laughing] I can’t leave them at home. No taters for sale tonight. You know? No. No, I like to keep it moving on stage ’cause I know, I know how you people operate. Okay, okay, I stand still for too long, you see something you like, you take a mental snapshot. Who knows what you’ll do with it later? I… I much prefer… I prefer to keep things moving, keep ’em blurry. Thank you very much. Try to take a mental snapshot and it’s nothing but a gray blur. Simple self-preservation. No, I look forward to it. I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, through death, of course, as a ghost.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSpecifically. I look forward to being a ghost, think of myself as a future ghost, the body as training wheels I can’t wait to cast off and fly free. You know? Not too free, of course. In order to become a ghost, you gotta get stuck here, and I’ll do what it takes. You know? You know, manufacture some unfinished business, do what’s necessary. My meditation practice these days, it’s getting too strong, you know? It’s getting too consistent where spiritually I’m kind of in a place where I die I sort of instantly transcend, instantly dissolve into the one. And that’s not what I want. I want to linger. Do you see, I wanna linger as me. I want to haunt a house, and I know perhaps that’s a quaint dream, you know, unoriginal, but it’s mine, nonetheless. I mean, imagine. To night after night, to night after night just watch television behind someone watching television. [audience laughing] Just giving yourself over to their programming choices. I mean, that… that would be a meditation in its own right, the surrender required there, you know. I just, uh… I wanna be a ghost, but if I make it as a ghost, I wanna be a strong ghost, a robust ghost, you know. No blurring away at the edges for me. I wanna have fully articulating fingertips. I want to be 75% opacity at minimum. [audience laughing] I’d say 85 max. I want you to know I’m a ghost.\\nOtherwise, what’s the point?\\n[audience laughing] Primarily you just wanna make sure you don’t end up as one of these orb figures, uh, the orb characters, they’re kinda the embarrassment of the ghost community, depending on who you talk to. [chuckles] I don’t know if you guys watch quite as much nonfiction, paranormal programming inside the home as I do. I watch quite a bit. I’m a lifelong learner. [audience laughing] But if you don’t know… if you don’t know the orbs, those are those, uh, small, transparent circles of light that occasionally appear in a photograph and someone’ll say, “Oh, great-grandmother did come to the wedding.” It’s nice. It’s really nice stuff. [audience chuckling] But people are so rude about orbs. I mean, if you try to talk about an orb with anything resembling seriousness, they come for you. They simply come for you, you know? And it’s just so rude. I mean, because imagine if you were the great-grandmother and you did it, you know? You managed to gather your strength in the afterlife and appear for your family as anything at all. I mean, a little circle, that’s pretty good. I mean, have any of you ever made yourselves appear as anything at all using your consciousness alone?\\nI certainly haven’t.\\n[audience laughing] One of the basic shapes. And then to be dismissed, just summarily dismissed by some surely unrigorous skeptic of a great-grandson. [laughs] I will not have that happen to me. No, everyone will know who’s present. It’ll be, “Hi, Johnny, it’s me.” You know? But that’s not the point. That’s not the point. Well, you know, if you insist on such a thing and you would, wouldn’t you? No, the point is I look forward to discarding the form, the flesh, uh, its needs, its wants, you know, all hideousities to me, uh… I am what many would historically call a heterosexual woman, and no, I’m not proud. [audience laughing] It’s a patent humiliation in this day and age. I know what you’re thinking. Does she even read? [audience laughing] And I do, I do, and yet, you know, how can I when I’m just a… a girl with a ponytail just lusting after the common shaft? [audience laughing] Oh, I can’t believe it happened to me. I mean, just that simple cylinder, that… that familiar tube, that object of seemingly no nuance. The word I’m avoiding saying, of course, is “penis” and now I’ve said it.\\nAnd do I feel better? No, I don’t.\\n[audience laughing] I don’t love the word, few do, you know. A big part of me would probably rather say the word “cock” for you people. I think a lot of you’d rather hear it. The boyfriends sure did, you know? [audience laughing] Cock is a good word, it has a kind of dignity to it. You know, you gotta wind it up and kick it from the back of your mouth. “Co” but then “ck.” It lands. A “ck, ck.” It lands on the same damn consonant it started on, you know? Penis. Penis just sort of slips out the side of the mouth.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Penis.” “I’m sorry. Did you say something?” “Well, I’m not sure anymore.” “I thought a word and I felt something happen.” You know? People say, people say, “Well sure, I wouldn’t use the word penis sexually, it’s too clinical.” I don’t hear the voice of the clinician in that word. I don’t think penis is our most medical-sounding word. I mean [chuckling]… I think the problem for people… I think the problem for people with the word penis lies in its sort of tender emotionality. I don’t think the word penis is a problem for people ’cause it sounds accurate to what it is. Penis. Penis. [chuckles] It sounds like a soft heartbeat. Penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis. And I think that’s the problem. I think… I think… I think the problem lies in the syllables themselves too. I don’t think this is one of these Rose-by-any-other-name scenarios. No, “Pe-” is clearly a problem. Pe… Peener… Pee-pee. You know, it’s been mocked for ages and rightfully so. You know? But to me, the true… the true tender syllable of devastation, oh, it’s the “nis.” It’s the “nis.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI mean, can you believe that’s been there the whole time? “Nis.” “Nis.” And that’s why no one speaks of that syllable. That’s why… that’s why no one says, you know, “Show me that nis.” [audience laughing] Wait till you see this nis? Nis-nis? They won’t even make a joke. No, it’s too tender. It cannot be spoken. No, “cock” clearly, clearly… “cock…” Clearly “cock” is the sexy word. You know? But there’s an issue. There’s a problem with the word “cock” for me. In a way, it becomes unsexy. And the problem is that when I call the penis a cock, I’m not actually calling it like I see it. [audience laughing] I’m kind of telling it what I think it wants to hear. [audience laughing] I’m worrying about the feelings of the penis. I’m coddling the little ego of the penis. I’m humoring the penis. Like, when I call the penis a cock, I don’t throw it away. It’s not cock, it’s cock. “Who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” [audience laughing] When I call a penis a cock, I’m humoring it. Like I might humor my little nephew, for example, or a friend’s son, you know? [laughs] You know, one of these guys, these over and down guys. These little… the person I love and the little guy below them. Like… when I call the penis a cock, I treat it like I treat my little nephew. He’ll come running into the kitchen where the adults are talking wearing a little monster mask or something, and we… we see him and it’s sort of like, “Oh, sorry, sorry… Ah!” and then right back to talking. [audience laughing] ‘Cause he didn’t scare us.\\nHe was unsuccessful in his little ruse.\\n[audience laughing] And you hear his feet… you know, he’s coming around again. You give him it even faster the second time. “Ah!” Right back to it. No showmanship… [laughs] …and yet he’s been rewarded. Now… Do you love your nephew? Of course. But do you respect him? [audience laughing] I don’t think you do. No, no, true respect… true respect for the nephew isn’t “Ah!” Right? No, true respect for the nephew is “What? No, you didn’t scare me, but I believe you can.” “So… so try again.” And to me, it’s the same with the penis. True respect for the penis, you know, it’s not, “Oh, who’s a cock? You’re a cock.” Right? True respect for the penis is, “Penis.”\\n[moaning]\\n[audience laughing] If the penis is enough, then the word “penis” should suffice, you know? If the penis has a chance at being sexy, then the word penis should have a chance at being sexy. And in theory… in theory, it’s enough, you know? You know? In theory, it suffices. I mean, arguably, I’m a fan in the sense that I show up for it time and again with a regularity you can count on. I’m a sort of church mouse to the wafer crumb on Monday morning. There’s me. Sniffing about, hoping for a taste of the divine. So if the penis isn’t the fucking cock, that I feel like I have to act like it is in its presence, but I’m still showing up for it. I’m still a fan. Then what am I showing up for? What is the penis to me? What is its nature?\\n[exhales]\\n[audience chuckling] Well, it’s tender.\\nIt’s responsive. You know, it’s like…\\n[audience laughing] It springs up under certain conditions. That’s why I think it has the soul of an artist, you know. [audience laughing] It sees something that intrigues it and it sort of… [audience laughing] It fills with inspiration. And it is a filling to me. It is a filling to me much more than it is a… [clicking] …erection. I think erection’s a little architectural for what’s happening there. I don’t think anyone should go in that building, I don’t think it’s safe. It’s not up to code. [audience laughing] And unlike a building, it doesn’t… it doesn’t topple, it withers. It dies on the vine. [audience laughing] The penis… the penis, it blooms and it withers and it blooms again. This kind of eternal flower stretching towards that which nurtures it, you know, as if warmed by the sun. I mean, it’s moving. It’s a romantic figure, a boldly romantic figure. I mean, it gathers its strength, you know, to just stretch away from the rest of the body. Just goes for it in this plea, you know. It just… [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] “Love me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience applauding]\\n“Touch me, please.” “Touch me.” “Touching you, touching me.” “Quick, I only have a minute.” [audience laughing] Meanwhile, they try to tell you the vulva is the flower, you know. The vulva is the rose, the petals of the rose. You know, the vulva. I appreciate those comparisons, you know. They’re trying to say that the vulva is beautiful, and I agree, you know. But if someone gave me a bouquet of roses and one of them looked like my vulva, [audience laughing] I’d say, “I think someone stepped on one of the roses.” [audience laughing] It slipped from the bouquet, someone stepped on it. Then they tried to get rid of the evidence by kicking it into a crack in the wall. And it just won’t fully disappear inside there, will it? No. And why are the petals so thick? [audience laughing] No, the vulva… the vulva is beautiful, but it requires the kind of tilted gaze of a more poetic eye. Shall I step in? I mean, I’ll give it a shot. To me, the vulva… my vulva, perhaps, my vulva is beautiful in the way that a tattered flag is beautiful. [audience laughing] Its frayed edges telling a tale of how ideals met actualities. [audience laughing] To me, a vulva may be beautiful in the way a burger is beautiful. A burger with all its particular fixings, you know, wrapped up in crinkly, greasy, foiled paper, and then they cut… I love when they wrap it up and then they cut it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd then they go… [swishes] Then you see the layers, these different textures and they’re pressed together. And yeah, there’s a threat of a spill. Yeah, there’s a risk of a sudden disassembly. But it holds. It holds. The vulva is the burger that holds. [audience laughing and applauding] The penis is the flower. The penis is… I think the penis is a feminine icon, if I may be so bold. [audience laughing] At very least, it’s the most feminine thing on my boyfriend’s body. Like, if my boyfriend got out of the shower and said, “Quick, find the little woman on this man.” [audience laughing] It’d be an odd game, but I’d instantly have an answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not the shoulder.\\n[audience laughing] I’d go, “I see her. I see her. She’s right there. Susan.” The name Susan would come to me instantly. His penis is a Susan, but looking back… looking back, they were all Susans to me. They were Susans, they were Geraldines, they were Vanessas. Now, am I saying the penis is a little woman? Well, if you’re a certain kind of guy who really doesn’t like that idea, then yeah, that’s exactly what the fuck I’m saying. [audience laughing] But no, it’s more like… it’s more like the rude stereotypes of women. Those were good descriptions of the penis the whole time. Describe women unfairly, you’re probably describing the penis perfectly, you know. “Oh, they’re so sensitive. They’re always reacting to things.” “They’re needy, they nag you, they poke you in the night.” “Hello. Are you awake?” “I’m awake. I guess we’re both awake now.” [audience laughing] The penis is the sensitive. The penis is the nag. The penis is the drama queen. I mean, the ultimate drama queen. Just one minute, life of the party, and then the very next just flopped over and sulking on the fainting couch… [audience laughing] …that is the inner thigh, just waiting for someone to notice that frankly she’s upset. [audience laughing] Can’t be mad at her, she didn’t make a scene, she just stepped aside. Just left the… I’m not making a face. This is my face. [audience laughing]\\nThis is the face you married.\\n[audience laughing] The penis orgasm has kind of a hysterical quality to it… [audience laughing] …in the old sense. A proper turn-of-the-century Vienna Freud’s couch. A proper neurotic hysteric. The orgasm, a kind of sudden revelation, a hideous blurt, as a… “I killed father,” you know. [audience laughing] A little… a little bit of Abigail in the courthouse in The Crucible. And I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil! And now everyone… everyone’s gotta deal with it. A hint… a hint of my mother at a family gathering. Something comes to mind she thinks to say, realizes she shouldn’t. And then there’s a pushing it down, but the only relief for her is for her to just get it out. I see her coming my way, just… [muttering] “Are you sad you don’t have kids?” And it’s on me. [audience laughing] And she feels better, and fair enough. Fair enough. I get her a journal every year for Christmas, but I’m the journal. I’m the journal, and that’s okay. [audience laughing] That’s okay. But no, I feel like my orgasm… my orgasm doesn’t put it on you in that same way. I feel like my orgasm has more of a selfless, heroic, frankly militaristic quality to it. [audience laughing] I feel like my orgasm’s like, “You guys, run, run!” Like, “I’ll throw myself on the grenade and absorb the shock with my body.” [audience laughing] And then at its most, you know, explosive moments of pleasure, the vaginal vulva complex, it doesn’t explode. You know, it holds.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt holds. It embodies the masculine, Stoic, ideal. It just pulses. Doing isometric work, contained and strong. A Viking against a tree after the battle is over. Just pulsing to the rhythm of the battle drums fading away. No, the penis… the penis is clearly the more physically vulnerable of the crotchal items we come across. That’s why I’ve never understood why it doesn’t fully retract into the body… [audience laughing] …after it’s done doing any of the things it does. I always feel like, “Wait. Why can I still see you?” “You’re weak. You need to go home.” “It’s not safe for you out here in that form. You need to retreat.” “Please retreat. Retreat. Retreat.” Sometimes I like to think of it as a puppet at a puppet show. It comes out and does its bit, but after this puppet’s bit is over it doesn’t disappear behind the puppet theater. This puppet just dies over the front of the stage and hangs there lifeless and scaring the children while the show continues, and you’re going, “I feel like we’re not supposed to be able to see that character anymore.” And you’re just hoping someone will just reel it back in or the other puppets will incorporate its death into the narrative.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe penis’s vulnerability is something I’ve been aware of for some time. Really since, I don’t know, age 11 when I started reading these magazines with these articles, headlines on the cover, “How to please your man.” They broke the story every month and I’d flip to the article to see if there was anything new. And it always kind of came down to a list of instructions about how not to injure the tender penis. You know? I remember specifically they said, “Careful near the tip.” “It’s extremely sensitive.” “You… you can’t imagine a part of the body as sensitive as the tip of a penis.” It’s like, “Oh God.” It must be very sensitive then, and that’s the first thing I’m gonna run into on the penis, like in my approach. I have to land gingerly ’cause that’s the most sensitive part? Shouldn’t you bury that treasure somewhere deeper in the castle?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI go, “All right. Once I’m past the gauntlet of the sensitive tip, surely now I can relax.” “I mean, I’m on the shaft, right?” The shaft sounds strong, but no, they had a warning there. They said the underside of the shaft, the skin is thin and delicate. Shall I dab eye cream on it with my weakest finger? [audience laughing] Dab and tap. We’ll need dab and tap. And then the balls, the storied balls. Endless mythology of the balls, the way things can go wrong for them and it’ll be your fault. The blue balls legend, of course. Cross-culturally it can vary, but the essence is always the same, you know. If you’re the cause… if you’re the cause of an erection, well… well, you better answer for that erection you caused. ‘Cause clock’s ticking and pretty soon those balls down there, well, they could turn blue and I’m just… it’s never clear what happens after that.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAll that’s clear is that now you’re the witch. You’re the witch. [audience laughing] You’re the witch that turns little balls blue. It’s just never been… it’s never been a sexually-inspiring threat to me. The blue balls threat. You know that kinda, “Oh, somebody might want to do something soon like jerk me off or something, ’cause otherwise it’s really gonna hurt down there. Ooh.” It just turns you into this baby and me into your mama sexually where I have to look out for your potential medical emergency ’cause you know, it takes a village. [audience laughing] No, I… I think it’s the helplessness of blue balls that repulses me. That kinda… you know… the refusal to relieve oneself. If I have a very full bladder, I don’t stand around complaining, “Why isn’t anyone bonking me on the lower abdomen to get the urine out.” Right? I would excuse myself to relieve myself. But blue balls has this kind of… kind of… kind of… “No!” Right? “I don’t do it. No.” “No!” This kind of overtired… “No, I don’t do it… No, only Mama.” [audience laughing] “Only Mama burp my dick.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s a burping of the dick. [chuckles] If blue balls are real, then to relieve them is to burp them. And look, I occasionally overreach with my metaphors, you know, for the love of the game.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNot that one, that one’s perfect. [audience laughing] The teeth-shaming started young. The messages of “Oh, if you have your full set of teeth, don’t you go in a room where a penis is.”\\n“It’s not safe for that penis.”\\n[audience laughing] “Why would you put that penis at risk, you toothy monster?” What’s the idea, what’s the plan? Are you gonna try to give someone a toothy blow job? Is that the idea? The Toothy Blow Job, another tale from Grimms’, I guess. [audience laughing] And somehow kind of a big concept at my high school. The first time I understood this in a practical way that my teeth were a potential danger to the penis, I was 12. I was at my best friend’s house after school. So it was me, it was my best friend, you know, 12, her older sister, 16, and the older sister’s best friend, 16. So the relationship there, you know, is… is over, up, and over and I always feel like Over, Up, and Over is someone you can get real information from. [audience chuckling] I know everything Over knows. Everything Over knows came from Up. Over, Up, and Over? That’s a diagonal… that’s a diagonal wisdom. You go, “Thank God I’m here on this day. It didn’t have to go this way.” But I feel like she knew her role was to teach ’cause she said to us, kinda out of nowhere, “All right, so I guess I’ll show you girls now how to give a blow job because well, you’ll need to know eventually and ’cause I’m the blow job queen.” She just said it. [audience laughing] And she took a cucumber out of the fridge and she wrapped it in cellophane out of respect for dinner, which I appreciated… [audience laughing] …and she began to demonstrate on the cucumber. I don’t know who can learn from a demonstration in this life, I mean, any context, you know, they just do nothing for me. Watching the art teacher paint. It’s just, “Indeed, I… I see why you’re the teacher.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You’re very good.” “Shall we proceed to our canvases now so the humiliations can begin.” You know? She’s demonstrating on the cucumber and I’m more stuck on what she said. The “blow job queen” thing. Maybe even more the way she said it, ’cause she just said it, you know, she just let the words ring out in the air. She didn’t make a face to let us know that she knew that she was being a little funny or grandiose. No, she just said it and she launched into her demonstration with authority and I had questions, none of which I asked, to be clear. No, no, I mean the first one being, “According to whom?” But I’m not going to ask that, okay. I’m not going to ask that. I mean, to be clear, I didn’t even blink when she said blow job queen ’cause I think that’s one of the few courtesies we can offer nice people in this life. If they go for it and do the impossible? Say something about themselves with confidence?\\nJesus, let them have it. I mean, just…\\n[audience laughing] And don’t act like you’re letting them have it but like, also reveal that you’re not letting them have it… Sort of blinking up a storm. No, hold their gaze and let them have it. [audience laughing] It’s a nearly impossible act, you know? I’ll occasionally say my own name and then just go, “Did I get that right?” You know? [audience laughing] The confidence… the confidence required to say something like that. I mean, wow, you know. It felt like it was a proper self-appointment. And that impressed me and that bewildered me. I mean, I’ve always attempted in this life to err towards what feels to me like a sort of prudent self-doubt in favor of the potentially foolish self-confidence, you know. Self-confidence is a good idea, you know. Yeah, but there’s a risk there.\\nThere’s a risk there.\\n[audience laughing] I fear that if I’m confident, I may turn into what I think of as The Two Fools. [exhales] Okay, so if I like myself, might feel good. But what if I’m wrong about myself? [chuckling] What are me and myself? We’re just these two fools just congratulating each other. “Oh. Best in the biz.” “No one quite like us. We’re fantastic.” To me, it feels safe, you know, if I stand in the bathroom mirror, to look at that person in the mirror and insult the person in the mirror. Say, “You’re a fool.” That way, even if they are a fool, at least me, on this side of the mirror, I’m someone who can spot a fool. [audience laughing] And then I… I am not, in myself, two fools. I’m a fool and someone who’s well aware. You know? [audience laughing] I’m a fool and someone apologizing for them. And then… and then my duo has 50% dignity. Do you see? I get a guaran… If you split in two and hate yourself, you get a guarantee of 50% dignity, versus taking the gamble of zero versus 100. Do you see… do you see… do you see how… how the math of self-hatred is unimpeachable? [audience laughing and applauding] But the seemingly self-appointed blow job queen,\\nI’ll take it. [laughs]\\n[audience laughing] The seemingly self-appointed blow job queen said a couple things in her lesson that really stuck with me through the years. The first was just an offhand comment. She goes like this. “Oh, and you can play with the balls if you want,” and… and then never mention them again.” [audience laughing] “If you want.” “You can play with the balls if you want.” I mean, I’m… I’m still thinking about it. [audience laughing] Like you’re gonna be there, you’re gonna be dying to play with those balls, but you won’t know if you’re allowed, and she wanted to let us know that like the toys in the pediatrician’s office… No, please, those are literally there for you. [audience laughing] I mean, if she’d said tickle the balls, if she said tickle the balls, I’d know what to do. That’s a specific action, but to play with something… to play with something? I mean, that’s an intuitive, absent-minded sort of act. I mean, how does one bring an authentic spirit of play… [audience laughing] …to the balls? ‘Cause if there was a hint of cliché to my ball play, I could not live, do you understand? No! A whiff of contrivance. No, it is authentic or not at all for me in this life. That is a principal I’ve stood by since infancy. Really, really, I was one of the most authentic infants on that ward.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt was facade-ville in there, honestly. All these babies. “Oh, look at me, I’m a baby.” Not me. I was just living. [audience laughing] Authentic or not at all, the principle I’ve stood by for better or worse. [chuckling] I could give you endless examples… I could give you endless examples of me choosing authenticity when I feel others did not. I’ll give you one example from childhood, perhaps you’ll see yourself reflected. So they used to make us play this game. They used to make us play this game in gym where you have to dance and the teacher says “freeze.” You gotta freeze in the position you’re in and if you can’t, you’re out. So here’s how I would approach that game with what I believe is authenticity. Would you mind saying freeze for me just after a couple seconds of my dancing? Okay, thank you. All right. Just you, please. Thank you, thank you. All right, this is me playing that game in gym. [man] Freeze! That was an authentic freeze. [audience laughing] You saw. You saw me do my best to freeze in the position I was in. Sometimes… I know it wasn’t particularly exciting, okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSometimes I’d see another kid approach it more like this. Could you do it again for me? All right, thank you. [man] Freeze. [audience laughing] Kids like that disgust me. [audience laughing and applauding] It’s deeply inauthentic. It’s deeply inauthentic. No, that’s not a freeze. That’s not a freeze. You didn’t freeze in the position you were in. No, you did not. No, you did not. And first of all, where were those moves during the dancing part? Nowhere. No, only now that we’re all commonly, boringly, and authentically paused, now you’re the big man. I don’t like it. I don’t like it one bit. I’ll bear witness to the end of my days. I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen. But I tell you this so you know. I tell you this so you understand that I hold myself to this same, cruel standard of authenticity. So I find myself asking, “How would I… how would I play with balls authentically?” [audience laughing] Well, I know what I would do if I had two clementines in a plastic bag, and I was waiting at a bus stop or something. [audience laughing] It’d be a bit of this. Yeah, I wouldn’t even have to think about it. It’d be totally unself-conscious play. I think it’d be going clockwise. Not because I planned it, that’s just sort of what I’d be doing. And I get to a point where I feel the potential energy build, and I go, “Do you think we could get one more revolution in and I do it?” Oh, yeah, yeah. I know it’s time. I know it’s time. And I let it spin back the other way, like, this is what we worked for.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Sensational! The spirit soars into the counterclockwise galaxy. But I’m not gonna do that with the balls, no. I… I wouldn’t even spin them a single degree. ‘Cause I think you’d know sorta what I was hoping to do. But I… I don’t believe the impulse is entirely my fault. I do believe that the anatomy of the balls itself is kind of daring us. Like, I do believe that the neck of the bag of the balls, it’s just long enough where its existence is sort of inherently posing the question of could it all spin past 12. [audience laughing] So satisfying if it took even once and came right back. No, I have no play. I have no play for the balls. I’ve overthought it, some would say. I don’t believe in that idea. But I don’t want to look like I’m afraid to touch the balls. Would you… would you like to know what I’ve done when it comes to the balls historically and presently? It’s not… it’s not great. [groaning lightly] I lift them an inch.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s a minor elevation, uh, it’s not particularly sexy, but you can’t be mad at me, I mean, I’m helping out. I’m help… I’m helping relieve the bag of the burden of gravity for a couple seconds in this life. And if that’s not worth something, I… I… I don’t know what is. But it feels feeble. I feel like the intern trying to add value, you know?\\n[audience laughing]\\nWithout waiting to be asked to do something, that horrible sensation. You want to help, there literally is no way. It’s the same weird sensation I get if I try to help a group of people move something heavy, you know, like a picnic table. I get there just a moment too late. The weight has already been distributed among the other carriers so you’re just sort of running along. You don’t have the weight. There’s no way to take it. Worst part, little jokes on the way. “I think I’m getting off easy today.” “Pretty sure you guys are doing all the work.” [laughs] No, no. I will not partake. No. If that happens to me, if I find myself in that scenario, no, I back away. I say, “And I thank you for what you do, but I will not live this lie.” [audience laughing] It’s the same with the balls for me. I become humiliated by the feebleness of this gesture and I gently lower, and I put my hand away, and that’s where I’ve been for some time now.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe second thing the blow job queen said, arguably this had to be her global philosophy ’cause it’s kind of how she wrapped up the lesson, she goes, “Look, I just want you to know that at the end of the day when it comes to the blow job, you really can’t go wrong…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…’Cause the person? They’re just happy to be there.” [audience laughing] Isn’t that beautiful? I loved that. That made sense to me. To me she’s saying, “It’s not technique that matters.” “It’s the spirit of the thing.” That put me at ease. Then she goes, “Well, as long as you don’t bite his dick off.” [laughing sarcastically] And I was like, “Um.” [audience laughing] “Before we move on to another subject, is that real?” “Could I bite a dick off?” And she was like, “You would never bite a dick off.” And I was like, “No, I said could I, could I, bite a dick off?” Like, if that was my goal, do I have the simple machinery necessary? ‘Cause if I “could” bite a dick off then “would” is just one letter away. I mean…\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s right there, especially if I’m worried about it. If I’m worried about it, then it’s “Don’t bite his dick off. Don’t bite his dick off.” “What’s the thing we don’t wanna do? Bite his dick off. One more time!” “Bite this dick off. Bite this dick off.” [chomps] It’d be right on the beat. That’s how I’d bite a dick off. No, I wanna know if I have what it takes. If you found my skull, my jaw, my teeth, the whole thing, if you found it in a field 200 years from now, you know, could you use that in a pinch as a weapon… [audience laughing] …specifically to bite dicks off? The question… the question was, can these bones… can these bones chomp through the penis’s bone? [audience chuckling] [exhales] And she said something like, “You know there’s no bone in there, right?” And I believe that I knew. [audience laughing] I believe I knew. But would you blame a girl for forgetting for a second? [audience laughing] Would you blame a girl for forgetting that there’s no bone in the penis when she was reared on terms like “boner?” [audience laughing] “Rock-hard boner.” When there is no bone in there, and what is there at its hardest, still not rock-hard.\\n[audience chuckling]\\n[chuckles] Not rock-hard. [audience laughing] No, it’s never been… rock-hard. [audience laughing and applauding] At its hardest, still not rock-hard. No. No. No. Rocks have certain qualities. [audience laughing] I’m no great geologist, but you couldn’t have a penis-paper-scissors game. No one’s playing the penis. It’s not a good substitute for a rock. Can’t take scissors, can’t take paper. It’d be a 50-50 game. Do you see? No one would play. No. To me, linguistically-speaking, a rock is something you get hit by. Like, “Oh God! Oh my God, I think I was just hit by a rock.” Right? A penis, you were slapped, no matter how it happens.\\n[audience laughing]\\nFalls from the sky, it’s a slappy kind of object. [unintelligible speech] Right? A rock is like, “Oh God!” Right? A penis is sort of… [unintelligible speech] [audience laughing] No, it’s like it’s a spirit. It’s a spirit. “Do you feel how hard I am?” “Do you feel how rock-hard this boner is?” And I’m like, “No.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“No, I don’t.” [laughing] “I know what you mean.” “I recognize the change in your penis you’re referring to, and sure, I’m glad.” But no, if it’s so rock-hard, then why is my tooth such a risk to it? [audience laughing] Shouldn’t I be afraid that my tooth, my little tooth, is gonna get chipped on your rock-hard fucking boner? But my dentist isn’t going to believe that story.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo. No. It’s not rock-hard. Picture the rockest-hardest boner you can, indulge me. Okay, take it into a nice restaurant in your mind. Plate it over a pureed celery root. Pour the jus, side of spinach, you know, sprig of parsley. Take a bite, tell me you’re not saying, “Tenderest meat I ever tasted.” Callin’ over the chef. “Chef, it fell right off the bone.” The chef has to remind you, actually there is no bone there. It’s a boneless cut of meat. It’s hard in the way a bag of blood is hard. It’s erectile flesh, much like a nipple. No, it’s not… it’s not rock-hard. It’s not rock-hard. I mean, if I had a pebble in my shoe, you know, I’d probably stop on the side of the street and take off my shoe and shake it out. If had a tiny, rock-hard boner in my shoe, I think I’m just going home.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo. And by the way, the Washington Monument isn’t phallic. It’s not phallic. That thing’s been standing for 175 years. Do you know what a rock never does? Stop being a rock all of a sudden.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI wanna be clear. Maybe it seems I’m being a little literal, you know. I get it, okay. [chuckling] Rock-hard boner. It’s descriptive language. It’s an image. It’s literary language, maybe not our finest, but that’s technically what it is. And I like that sort of thing as much as the next girl. Okay? It’s just that all the language of the penis that’s supposed to make it seem cock-like, you know? Just draws attention back to me to the penis’s very tender nature. The… the rock-hard boner, the… the anaconda, the penis as snake. It’s always compared to a snake. The penis is not a snake. No. I mean, snakes, I’m pretty sure they have sharp senses and at the very least, they’re pretty with it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI mean, I think they strike with precision, you know. I’ve never not guided a penis anywhere it was headed. [audience laughing] And that’s not a complaint either. I prefer a guided entry. I much prefer a guided entry. I prefer it to the sort of, “Look ma. No hands. I’ll find my way.” You know. [audience laughing] “Don’t help! Don’t help!” [audience laughing] “What if I try the same spot and angle again but now with more force?” “You did it. You did it.” [laughs] “You managed to elbow your way in at some weird angle.” “You dragged half of me inside of me with me.” ‘Cause it’s like taking the arm out of a coat and the sleeve got pulled along too.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNow I have to spend a minute working that out, getting things back on track while acting like I’m not getting things on track. [chuckling] Trying to line up the silky interiors, not the woolen exteriors. I think the word penetrate’s a bit much for what happens between a penis and me. Every time you penetrate, you penetrate, you penetrate enemy territory. No, you’re a guest in my home. I invited you in, and I made it quite pleasant for you. [audience laughing] No, you know if you look up “penetrate” in the dictionary, or my favorite dictionary, the thesaurus… [moans] I love the thesaurus. I love the way it gets right to it with those other words.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYeah, none of them are perfect, but there they are. The people’s dictionary, I always say. [audience laughing] The first synonym for “penetrate” is “puncture,” but you didn’t puncture anything here. This is a working passageway and it’s been one for some time. You missed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. We’ve been operational for a while now. And I’m not saying it’s this grand open entrance that you could sort of amble on in. No. No. The walls of this vaginal canal lie flat, indeed they do. [moans] Okay. But the walls of a glove lie flat. And when you put your hand into a glove, you don’t say, “I penetrated that glove.” You put your gloves on and you don’t even talk about it. [audience laughing] If you don’t like penetrate, like I don’t, your next option, “Enter.” Oh, the more literary “to enter someone,” you know like, “Oh, oh, the moment.” “Oh, the very moment that you entered me, my world changed and me along with it.”\\nNo, I’ve never been entered. [chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] No, I think it’s a matter of scale for me, you know? Like, uh… like, um… You know, if my body was a building. If my body was like a store, like a Target, and someone did the equivalent of what entering me is into Target, I don’t think they’re even passed those second glass doors. [audience laughing] I don’t think they can really say they went to Target today. [audience laughing] No, I think they loitered in the entryway. They made those doors open and close and open and close primarily. They were a problem in the parking lot outside Target today. “Penetrate.” “Enter me.” “Laid pipe in her.” I heard that for the first time in college. “I laid pipe in her” and the penis is supposed to be the pipe. Here, young man? And you’re the plumber? You’ve plumbed nothing in this life. I know that. You’re an Econ major and I’ve hated you for some time.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\n“Choke on it, bitch.” “Uh, choke on… choke on this dick. Choke on this fat dick.” “Let’s hear you choke and make the choke… [vocalizes]” Is that what you want? The look of fear and panic in my eye? [vocalizing] I’ve always been afraid of choking, one of my main fears. Never on the penis. No, never been afraid of choking on the penis ’cause it’s not a choking hazard, it’s attached. [audience laughing] I’m choking on it. I’m choking on it. I’m choking on that dick. Oh wait. [audience laughing and applauding] I’m completely safe. [audience laughing] Death is here. Ooh, death is here. Gonna try to live a long life if I take care of myself properly and make a few good decisions. No. You know what? No one would ever deep throat a gumball. No one would gargle a gumball in the back of their throat. That’s a real risk. No. No. A child’s gumball is more of a threat than the cock. Do you see? [audience laughing] I wasn’t always this way.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckles] Okay. You know this whole, “Your cock ain’t shit.” [laughing sarcastically] No. No, you don’t start out this way and then feel the need to do this, okay.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, I used to be afraid. [audience chuckling] Like, the first time that I tried to give a blow job, for example, I failed miserably. I backed out at the last possible second before doing it ’cause I realized the essential problem with the thing and it was perfect circumstances too. Really. I was 16 and I had a boyfriend a grade above me. You know, I had the boyfriend laid out on a bed like a patient etherized upon a table his body a slow-moving fog, I guess. I’ve got him on this bed in someone’s guest room, someone’s finished basement. Oh, and I love the smell of a newly-finished basement, you know. The off-gassing of the fresh rug. The feeling the family’s doing it. They finished the basement, what’s next, the deck? Oh God. I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine but I know it’s going to be so goddamn beautiful.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I’ve got him on this bed in this guest room in this finished basement. Someone’s party’s going on upstairs. Someone’s parents not home. So many layers between me and the boyfriend. You know, and my own home, my own parents. I mean, this is as close as you can get to attempting a blow job in a vacuum.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I make my way, you know, down the torso. [audience laughing] And all that that entails, you know, the whole… [exhales] …the whole, “Can she do it?” [audience laughing] The uncertainty, the whole thing. And maybe I took it too slowly, too humbly, not enough speed, momentum, confidence, but when I get there, I am hesitating. I am not doing it. I… [sighs] …I’m hovering even.\\n[humming]\\n[audience laughing] And it’s a bummer ’cause I really want to do it. And some would say, “You didn’t really want to do it in the sense of desire or you’d just be doing it.” No, I mean, yeah. [chuckles] I’ve never hovered over a French fry. That is true. [audience laughing] The second I recognize the desire, I collapse the desire through the consumption of the fry, but I did want to do it. I wanted to do it, and that’s real too. You have to understand at this time in my life I get dropped off at Borders bookstore quite a bit. [audience laughing] I’d stay there for hours and I’d read all sorts of things, you know, including these quote books, these compilations of quotations. I’d sort of lock my knees and speed-read the quote books to try to get the wisdom of the ages. When you speed-read those books, certain themes emerge, a big one “Youth is wasted on the young.” And I hear you, voices of the past. I’m not gonna do that. No. I’m gonna drink cum. I’m gonna drink cum in the July grass, under the moonlight, and I’m gonna do it as soon as I can. I mean, that’s what Borders teaches you.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIf you’re a young, voracious reader, there’s so much passion in those pages. So many lives lived, you know, and the feeling that my life can only be one book at most. So I wanna get started on that life. But I’m there. I’m there and I’m not getting started on it, you know. And why? Why? Is it ’cause I feel all alone before the awesomeness of this great task? You know? Not really. I actually feel the full support of the entire field hockey team behind me on this one. ‘Cause they had driven me to this party on this night to give this specific blow job.\\n[audience laughing]\\nEarlier that night I was at a team-spirit-building sleepover with the entire team, and the older girls who are friends with my older boyfriend, I guess they were looking out, you know, for him and me, in a way. [audience laughing] And they said, like, “We understand you haven’t given him a blow job yet.” You know, like, “Why? [chuckles] Is it ’cause you’re afraid?” “You don’t have to be afraid. It’s a… It’s a ‘Just do it’ kind of thing.” “You just do it and then you’ll have done it and that will be it. 3, 2, 1, fake until you make it, just do it…” “That’s wonderful advice,” I said. You know, “Thank you.” “Next time I see him, that’s just what I’ll do. I’ll just do it.” They were like, “But next time can be now. He’s only five minutes away by car.” “And we have a car. Here’s a beer.” I could barely get four sips of the beer down, I’m a cocktail woman. I didn’t know that yet.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd they got me out to the car and they chanted, “Blow him.” “Blow him. Blow him. Blow him.” Maybe it sounds like peer pressure to some. [audience laughing] I didn’t experience it as such. No, I experienced their pressure as support you see, because I was a young Tony Robbins reader. [audience laughing] So I knew if you tell people your goals, you become more likely to achieve them. You… you feel accountable. Do you see? I had done the Personal Power series in sixth grade, uh, the 48 cassette tapes. Bit of a close read of Awaken the Giant Within in seventh, and now in high school, I was revisiting Giant to prepare for PSATs. I know, you can’t prepare for the PSATs. No, but you can dismantle the limiting beliefs that get you a negative headspace, which can affect where you land in your general scoring territory, so…\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nThe team captain drives me over to the party where my boyfriend is and on the way, you know, tries to level with me, like, “So really, why haven’t you done it?” “Like why haven’t you given your boyfriend a blow job?” And I was like, “Well, primarily I’m worried about the teeth.” “I don’t understand where they’re gonna go. They’re everywhere.” [audience laughing] “And you know, there’s no bone in there?” and she already knew. [audience laughing] She’s like, “You don’t have to worry about the teeth ’cause the way you give the blow job is you lubricate around the mouth, nose down, grease it up with lip balm or Vaseline or anything of your choosing, and then you wrap each lip around each corresponding row of teeth, under, over and then you smile.” “To pull it taut, so…” [audience laughing] “And then it safely slides, you see. Keep smiling.”\\nSome of you are thinking, “Indeed.”\\n[audience laughing] “Yeah, Sweetie, we know what a blow job is. Carry on.” You know. I don’t know. It could be 5% of you. It could be 95% of you. There are… there are no rules, but… When she said it, she was like, “You get it? You get it?” And I was like, “Yes. Thank you, you solved it.” And she had. But it was like when someone gives you bad directions. You’re pretty sure they’re wrong, but you feel you gotta wait till they’re out of view before you ask someone else, you know, ’cause you had a thing, you had rapport. And so it’s just, you know you’re polite and still alone on the side of the road…\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Something in me when she said that… You know, something in me said that… that… [audience chuckling]\\nThat can’t be it.\\n[audience laughing] This greased up Muppet. That… [audience laughing and applauding] That can’t be what a blow job is, you know. For the blow job to be a thing at all, for it to have its own title, you know, for it to have endured through the ages, and for someone to have invented it in the first place spontaneously in the woods like some bloated-heart cave person who felt this passion the other moves just weren’t freshly expressing, you know. And then they improvised. Like, “What’s the craziest…” Like, “Wait, wait!” “What’s the craziest thing I can do to you?” They thought about it… and then they knew. You know, like, “Ah!” And they knew what they had, you know. And it’s like the windowed envelope. It’s a simple, but elegant solution. Could you have thought of it? You know what I’m talking about? Address, you put it on the letter, then you put it in an envelope. You don’t have to put the address ’cause there’s a window in it. Before someone thought of that, no one thought of that. [audience laughing] To me, it’s the same with a blow job. I mean, just… “What’s the craziest thing I could do to you?” “How could I express the intensity of…?” And then they knew what they had. And it was a risk, but they went for it. You know, they just… [moaning progressively louder]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat kind of genius, I mean, it cannot be overstated. It just seemed to me like for the blow job to have come about spontaneously, it shouldn’t require these… these clever work-arounds, you know. These little hacks and the wasting of my kiwi Body Shop lip balm, you know. It seemed like it should just have a way it just works. An internal poetry to it. You know, I wanna do it like that. Like I was inventing it. Like there was no word for it yet. Real pre-printing press kind of dignity. Authentic. Authentic or not at all, you know? But I’m there, and I’m not doing it. And this is when I realize the essential problem of the thing. It’s those first couple moments, I’m not going to be doing it well. Of course, I’d never done it before. Fair enough. That’s not the problem. The problem is that in those moments when I’m doing it badly, I won’t be able to articulate to the person that I know that I’m doing it badly.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBecause my mouth is stuffed full of genitals. Do you see… do you see? The blow job precludes your ability to narrate, to explain yourself, to provide context, to make a little joke. There’s no way to communicate awareness. And it’s always about communicating awareness for me. You know, I don’t actually mind being a fool in this life, you know. As long as I can let you know that I, too, hear the jangle of the bells upon my hat. [audience laughing and applauding] [cheering] Ding-a-ling. Ding-a-ling. Indeed, I hear them too. “You’d never believe this, I sewed those in.” I make my own costumes, and I thought they might be interesting.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, if I had a second mouth in this scenario, I’d be aces. I mean, this’d be nothing. It’d be one mouth to attempt the blow job and a second one to go, “Okay. Hold on.” “Obviously, this is not a blow job yet.” “I’m just trying to get in a position where I… wow.” “My tooth has already dragged. Obviously you felt that.” “I just want to let you know that we’re aware of the problem and we are working on a solution, and we so greatly appreciate your patience on this day.” But no. No. You have no words, all you have is dumb eyes. Just the…\\n[audience laughing]\\nJust the dumb eyes of someone figuring something out. Just that stupid learning-on-the-job look. I hate that look. No dignity in it, just concentration. You know, earnest attempts at adjusting in the moment to surprise. No. No. No. No dignity. No. No words, no dignity. No words, I see no way through, and so I don’t know what to do. So I just start backing my way, you know, just back up the torso as humbly and feebly as I had gone, and I… I get back to the face and I was like, I wanna do something, I mean, my team is counting on me.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nAnd Borders. Above all, Borders, you know. I want to… I want to get started on this life. And so I take a deep breath… [inhales] …and relax ’cause that’s the thing. You relax and the answer is supposed to appear and for once it did. My virginity, I gave it to him.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nProcess that however you need. Okay, but for me, it was genius. For me, it was genius. Absolutely genius. ‘Cause I never valued my virginity. Why would I? I’m a self-starter, and I had gotten that just for showing up on Earth. I hadn’t earned it. No. To me, virginity always felt like the house’s money. [audience laughing] I got this virginity here, I think we’re supposed to spend it. It’s almost like, like a voucher. Like, two vouchers in a gift bag in a hotel room, like, “They put two virginity vouchers in here.” I mean, people make a big deal about this, but I don’t really give a shit. But for a goof, we should probably try to use it before we leave the resort. I wasn’t worried about saving myself, you know, my… myself for marriage. If my… myself, referred to my fear and discomfort around my body and yours. For you, true love. No. If I was gonna present something to the eventual true love, I’d want it to be a collection of sexual skills and an attitude of confidence, you know, with which to employ them. A sort of idiosyncratic lexicon to express my idiosyncratic yet universal love. But in order to gain those skills, I’d have to have a variety of lesser experiences. That’s just how it goes. I’d have to have my training montage.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nThen I can set it aside. Then like the moody prince renouncing his wealth, you know, I could set that aside and then eventually for the true love on my wedding day, you know, my father could present that, you know, on behalf of the family. “From our family to yours.” “I don’t know what to say, but I know she worked really hard on this.” [audience laughing] I wasn’t worried about purity, the idea that with every sexual experience, uh, you’re a little more diminished. That sort of the scratch-and-sniff sticker model of personhood. You know, kinda, “Oh, little scratch here, little sniff there.” “It’s a good time, sure, isn’t it? But yeah, yeah, pretty soon, what are you?” “You’re a faded strawberry in sunglasses. Is that what you want?” What do we do with you then, move you to the back of the sticker book with your slut sisters? Oh, we all remember what happened to your eldest sister, beautiful root beer float with feet.\\n[audience laughing]\\nTried to put her out to pasture. She died under a man’s boot. She didn’t have a stink left on her. No sniff on her, no stink on her, just slipped right out, rolled right up… You ever see a sticker roll up on itself?\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo, I was ready… I was ready to be a sexually-active teen. And sex, technically-speaking, I mean, it solved a problem, you know? Do you like dry humping but are tired of being injured by the seam of your jeans? [audience laughing] I was ready to be a sexually-active, gum-chewing teen doing the Health teacher proud, you know. And she was proud, and I sensed it. I felt pretty good about it. I also remember sensing the pride of my boyfriend’s father at the time.\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] Yeah, I think the son had told the father, and there was a notable spring in the man’s step on behalf of his son. Yeah. It’s disgusting. And maybe that’s just ’cause I don’t love a boyfriend’s father, you know, as a figure in general. I think they’re wrong and shouldn’t exist. [audience laughing] But particularly in high school, you know. Even when they’re lovely, it’s the role itself, you know. It’s not even their fault. “Oh, hello.” “Hello, Jacqueline, how are you?” You know, “How’s school?” And it’s just like, “Don’t fucking look at me or talk to me, sir.” “Please, honestly, it’s not a good look for you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou know, “Your son gained access to me, your son gained access to me through his own merits.” “You’re owed nothing here.” Not a wave hello. Not a whiff on the side. I think it would be best for all of us if when you heard my car coming down the road, you made yourself scarce.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou went to your little shed and did whatever the hell it is you do in that hideous little shed of yours. If I seem deranged… if I seem deranged in my anger at the boyfriend’s father, it’s ’cause he was a particular kind of asshole. He wasn’t unlike many adults at that time in my life. He would comment a lot on my use of the word “like.” He was obsessed. You know, just like… “Sorry, Jacqueline. It’s just that when you talk, all I hear is the word ‘like.\\'” “It’s all I can focus on. You know and it’s just…” [groans] That’s all you can hear? That… that’s all you can focus on? Then let me be a cognitive exercise for you, sir, in your fight against mental decline.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nIt’s the same word over and over again. Block it out, make it white noise. Selectively ignoring information is one of six basic cognitive skills. I see you doing your little puzzles. Perhaps add “listening to me talk” to the mix if you refuse to go to your shed as I directed earlier.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nOh, it was really gross, it was really gross ’cause he acted like he cared, you know, in this way, like, he’d be like, “No, it’s just that…” “No, Jacqueline, it’s just that when you use that word so much, you… you dilute the meanings of these things you seem to be trying to say.” “You sound unintelligent.” And it’s rich coming from a man who, looking back, never once said a single thing that caused me to sort of stir with the recognition of original thought. [audience laughing] He was concerned about the potency of my speech. No. No, sir. No. You have not understood at all. No. My intellect is a river, okay? It’s a river and the word “like” is a stone, and I drop stones into that river to break up the current so you’re not swept the fuck under and drowned. [audience cheering and applauding] I say “like” as a courtesy to men like you… [audience laughing] …because you couldn’t handle me.\\n[softly] Precise.\\n[audience laughing] And I know you’re real proud of your son for fucking me, but I’m fucking him, that’s the way that’s going down. He’s not entering me. I’m closing down around him. [audience laughing]\\nHe doesn’t penetrate me. I eat him.\\n[audience laughing] I chew him up and I spit him out diminished, and he loves every goddamn second of it. Just like you would, you pig. [audience laughing] You pig in shorts.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI didn’t… I didn’t say shit to the father, to be clear. I could never… I could never do that to a man. I mean, imagine his face. He would’ve been destroyed. I mean, the way he would have crumbled. No, I could never. I could never. But his son was never to know a blow job from me. That’s something, I think. I mean, it wasn’t the father’s fault, to be clear. I just… I… I couldn’t try again with this boyfriend, you know, ’cause he had seen me attempt it once and then retreat in fear. So now if I were to just go for it again, it would have too much of the quality of someone going for it again, you know. “Oh, nerves got her yesterday.” Like the Olympic skater. “Let’s see. Can she land her jumps today?” You know? No, there’s too much awareness. No. I felt like my only option for dignity was to wait out the year, never mention the failed attempt, and then at the end of the summer send that boyfriend off to college so I could start my senior year fresh. That’s what I did, top of my senior year. You know. I scooped up a new boyfriend ’cause I knew that I just… [sighs] In order to be a new person, I kind of needed a new person to be one in front of.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo top of my senior year, I scoop up this new boyfriend and I get him into my parent’s basement, and my parent’s basement is an unfinished basement. So it all feels real, raw, and right, you know? And I decide I’m gonna give him a blow job on the first night we hang out, before he knows me well enough to know my faces, to be able to discern the difference between a mask of confidence and actual real confidence. It’s… it’s a sexual running start, you know? It’s speed. It’s momentum. It’s… it’s about embodying the spirit of the cave person. Like I’m trying to act like I don’t even understand what clothes are. There’s just something in the way of my mouth’s pure desire, even though in my head, I’m like, “Abercrombie. Abercrombie. Abercrombie.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd it’s kind of a literal running start too ’cause I wanna come from around the basement stairs. Already going for it! You know, it’s that old trick. The blow job starts behind the stairs so they don’t see you wind up. The point is you would’ve been proud. You would’ve been proud. It’s just going, “Ah, ah,” right? And I go, like, “Ah, ah,” and I can tell he’s buying it, you know? And I go, “Ah,” and just right before doing it, I just go, “Oh my God. Look who’s not hesitating.” “Let’s take a moment to say look who’s not hesitating.” And it was just, I don’t know why, I just… “Ah.” And then, you know… and… [chuckles] I was at a dead stop yet again. I… I couldn’t believe it. I mean, just… [humming] Again. This is why I don’t trust the running starts in this life. Do you understand? They don’t carry you through. You have to keep running. I mean… This is why I don’t trust the confident entrances. You know, I know you people deserve something at the top of the show, put you at ease, you know? “What’s up, Town Hall?” “What’s up, New York? Get on your fucking feet.” “I’m the fuckin’ greatest, let you know you’re in good hands.” No. No. You see… “Ah, ah.” And then you see it crack. You see it crack, and decay over the course of the show. [audience chuckling] I’d rather build from nothing. I’d rather just get pushed out, like “Hello? I don’t deserve to live…” You know, “May I have a single breath?” [inhales] “Thank you. That should hold me for a little while.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI don’t know why I thought the running start thing would work for me. It’s not who I am. You know? I’m someone that’s gone to the end of a diving board and sort of… and sort of… three, two, one, and then pulled it back impossibly at the last second. [audience laughing] You know, just with a move infinitely more complex than the original dive. And it’s just, “Lifeguard. Clear the ladder, I’m coming down.” “Help me out, lifeguard.” I’ve cleared 1,000 ladders in my day. It’s who I am. There’s something in me that knows that in this life, it is almost never… it is almost never too late to turn back. [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] But I’m there. And I’m like, really? Really, we’re hesitating again? What’s the plan here, sweetheart? What… what are you gonna do? Are you gonna back your ass up another goddamn torso? Wait out another year so you can try again next year? On a new person to be a new person in front of in college on unfamiliar territory? No, no, you need to just do it. Well, you’re not a ‘just do it’ person. Do you listen to yourself? I don’t care. I don’t care if you’re an overthinker who wishes she had a second mouth to narrate her every experience. Everyone’ll know I know she knows. It’s about jingle, jangle in this life. Awareness! Aware… No, you need to find the way. Well, Nietzsche said there is no way, there’s only my way. Then find Nietzsche’s way. Then find your way. I have to find a way. So, I… I turned to literature. I, uh…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was reading Lolita at the time. It is what it is. And I was very taken with the language of Vladimir Nabokov. I mean, who… who wouldn’t be, you know? I’ll admit, I was probably reading it in a slightly performative fashion. I was reading it, to be clear, every word, but I did most enjoy reading it in the windows of pizza shops in my field hockey kilt, you know. Just cover visible, daring adults that walk by to be shocked, you know, just, “I’m sorry. Are you working through the Russian greats?” “I doubt it, you suburban hogs.”\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nBut I’m there. I’m there, and it’s the same old concerns. You know, no words. No dignity. Looking stupid, sounding stupid, dragging a tooth, all of it, and I go, “All right, all right, “I can’t narrate.” “But what if I imagine someone else is? What if I imagine Vladimir Nabokov is?” “What if I imagine this isn’t real,” you know, “this is just a…” [sighs] “I’m just a character in a short story written by Vladimir Nabokov, then no matter how badly this attempt at a blow job goes, I mean, in Nabokov’s deft pen, would the prose not sparkle?” I mean, isn’t it all literature in a way? Isn’t it all text upon text upon text, you know? [groans] And in literature, things can’t go badly. They can only be interesting. The ways that go badly are just the interesting details that bring textures to the story, and I go, “What if the worst happens? What if that happens?” “Don’t get ahead of yourself. What if that happens?” “What if you bite this dick clean off?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI go, “Well then, you’re likely living inside of the most iconic story in the collection.” “The one where she bites the dick off.” And so I go, “It’s not real. It’s literature.” “It’s all text in the end. Oh.” “Moonlight,” it’s not my finest. “Moonlight.” Start with the moon, yo. “Moonlight streams in on the south face of a young man’s penis.” “A girl with brown hair with red undertones that often go unnoticed…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…fumbles her way onto the simple cylinder…” [muffled] …penis… It’s not real… [muffled narration continues] …an American citizen… [muffled narration continues]\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd then I’m doing it. I’m doing it. I’m on that dick! [audience applauding and cheering] Thank you. [chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. Uh, I know it might have sounded a little close to dissociation for some of you there for a minute. Not what we want for our girls. Okay, “Oh, things don’t happen to me. They happen to her, of course. Who? Her.” When things get hairy in my life, I go to a little room in my brain. I might live very small, I watch a tiny television. Only droll things. Oh, yes. Sometimes the little screen tries to show me what’s happening to me in my real and hideous life. I feel for the clicker, and I… No, this was not dissociation. No, this… this was me with an idea. This was transcendence of the ego. Oh. There’s a difference, and it got me on that dick, and I was cooking. I was really cooking. There were no screams of pain. It seemed to just have an internal poetry to it. Like I always thought it should, you know? [exhales] And before I knew it, he ejaculated semen into my mouth as they say, you know the expression. [audience laughing] And I swallowed it ’cause I’m a Tony Robbins reader, and I don’t cut corners.\\n[audience applauding and cheering]\\nNow I always knew. I always knew I’d swallow it. That… that was never a point of neuroses. I knew there was an easy way, a difficult way. I’m gonna default to the difficult way to pick up points. I’m a sort of 3.7-in-the-AP-course-load kind of gal. Not a 4.0 in a lesser class, so yeah. Yeah, I’m gonna swallow it and let the chips fall where they do, and it was a triumph. I mean, it was a goddamn triumph. I wanted to write my college essay about it, but I knew they couldn’t handle it. [audience laughing] They didn’t have the sophistication. No, not the guidance counselors, not the deans, not one of them. Not like you people.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut I knew… I knew what I had done, and I went off to college, you know, feeling pretty good about myself. And it was interesting because it was a sort of Catholic-ish college. At the very least, there were a lot of Catholic virgin boys in neckties sort of scurrying about the place, scrambling for sexual experience at parties. You know, very crass, not me. I had done the coursework in high school. [audience chuckling] And I’m a Jew, so if anything I felt like a kind of Philip Roth figure among them. I felt like a Jewish pervert ready to teach. [audience laughing] Sensational if you can pull it off. I highly recommend. But at this time, I was really in no hurry to blow anyone. To me, the blow job, it was just a conquered thing, you know. It was an art form I… I had mastered in a basic way, I had a working definition of, and now I can think about how I might eventually wanna meaningfully subvert that art form. I was… I was asking big questions like, “What… what can the blow job mean?” You know, “Can the blow job be a love letter… [audience chuckling] …if there’s enough love behind it?” “Can the blow job be a poem? My body, a crude but ecstatic language.” I was in a lot of philosophy classes, and it was all very post-modern and inspiring. And at this time when I eventually came across someone I really liked, a French fry, so to speak…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI blew them, I mean, I simply blew them. Do you see? Not right away, but pretty quickly. [audience laughing] I mean, why wouldn’t I? Do you see, this was what all the work was for. It was as effortless as eating a fry. My lexicon was ready. This was my symphony and my symphony played beautifully. [pants] Was there a let-down after? I don’t know. I wasn’t expecting a marriage proposal.\\nI wouldn’t have been shocked by one.\\n[audience laughing] But I wasn’t expecting one. No. Can a blow job be a love letter? Yes, yes, it can. It doesn’t mean that they’ll love you back and that’s okay ’cause we know. We know, we know, as artists, we’re only entitled to our labor, not the fruits of our labor. Yeah, I think what bummed me out at the time was more the sort of, um, prevailing council of friends, you know. There was this sort of prevailing idea, this sort of, “Well, you know, you’re a modern gal so have your fun here and there of course, but if you really like someone, oh, ‘You really like this one, ‘ you said… [whispering] …then you take it slow.” You know? “Oh. Take it slow.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Good to be not too available.” [muffled] “Take it slow… Then you hook…” Ew. [audience laughing] Ew. Ew, no. No, I will not take it slow. No. The hubris astonishes. Death is coming. [audience laughing] Death is coming. And you gotta try to forget to get through the day. You gotta think of yourself as the lead actor in the television series of your life. You’re gonna go, “They’re not killing off my character anytime soon. I’m in…” “I’m in every scene. I think we’re good here.” But what if you’re not the lead actor? I mean, there are other characters. What if you’re not even in the show? What if you’re Steven Tanzer? That’s an actor friend of mine. Very unsuccessful. [audience laughing] Almost no roles. [audience chuckling]\\nIt’s the darkest line in the show.\\n[audience laughing] And it’s not a real man’s name, okay? I would never do that to a man. I could never do… But in some ways, it’s worse, ’cause I conjure Steven Tanzer nightly only to destroy him. He lives and dies but to serve as a single illustrative detail in my narrative argument. A fate I wish on few. [chuckles] But death is coming and I have this idea. I have this idea as you know that you shed the form, you shed the flesh and the indignities are left behind with it, but I’m not so sure the embarrassments don’t continue. Why wouldn’t they, you know. I know… I know that I feel embarrassment for certain dead relatives of mine. And really most of them. You know, when I look at photos of them, beautiful photos in beautiful frames, I mean, I’m talking about the real piano toppers in my parent’s home, I look at these photos of them and I can’t shake it, they look dumb to me. They look foolish ’cause I can see in their eyes that in the photo, they don’t realize that they’re dead now.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nThey look like suckers. I just wanna go, “You’re dead. You’re dead. You’re dead.” You know? [audience laughing] All you gotta do… all you gotta do is try when someone takes a photo of you to just give a hint of a knowing glance. I mean, something, just…\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nJust something that, should you die, you know, and someone looks at a photo, they can tell you know whence you stare, and “I’m coming to collect you one of these days.” So I’m in college… I’m in college, and I’m very aware that death is coming. I’m no spring chicken. So I feel like if I have love to give and this eloquent blow job with which to express it, I’m going to. And I do, and I stand by it. But then I go home for a winter break and I run into the old blow job triumph boyfriend from my senior year, and you know we go to the diner so we can eat eggs at night and uh… [audience laughing] …you know, drink our coffee black now. We don’t need this container of sugar packets. “Oh, it stays on the table? Fair enough. I don’t know why as we won’t be using it.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“We drink our coffee black now.” But we’re talking now, we’re talking like old army buddies. [chuckling] It’s been however many months since graduation, but we’re just talking with this grand perspective, so naturally I’m telling him about the latest guy that I really like at school, and I say something to the old blow job boyfriend, like, “Yeah, I just can’t tell if this guy I like likes me quite as much as I like him.” And the old blowjob boyfriend goes, “Well, maybe he’s intimidated by you.” “Yeah, like I was.”\\n“Still am in some ways.”\\n[audience chuckling] “Never really relaxed around you our entire relationship senior year ever since that first night we hung out when you just randomly blew me.” [audience laughing and applauding] “It was just so random.” “The way you just blew me, blew me.”\\n“It was just… random house.”\\n[audience laughing] “It was Penguin Random House, the way you just blew me, blew me.” Kept hitting the “B.” Blew me. Blew me. I was like, “Oh God.” Like… like, what did I become? Like, through my fear, I was blinded to the prospect that I, too, can make another afraid, and this is how the cycle continues.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut then I was like, “Wait, no. Excuse me, how rude.” “No. Like, you’re not the innocent, afraid one in this story.” “I’m the innocent, afraid one in this story who was conquering a fear on this day.” “Like, how dare you rob me of my origin story here?” “Like, how dare you try to turn me into the scary, slut villain, you know.” No. No, I was intimidating on that day perhaps but… but… but only in the way Batman’s intimidating, you know. You know, yes, Batman’s intimidating, but how dare you. How dare you look at Batman and not remember that Batman’s only Batman ’cause Batman was a little boy whose parents were killed brutally outside that theater. And the bats flew by, so he was afraid of bats. He had to go be in the cave among the bats to emerge as Batman. So if you see a Batman, there’s a fear of bats that preceded it. If you see a strength, there’s a fear that’s been turned inside out. Overcompensation. Same story 1,000 times. How dare you not see the little boy in me? And he didn’t get it, and fair enough, you know.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was imprecise, I guess. And he’s one of these people who doesn’t appreciate when you get up and demonstrate something in a restaurant.\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] That’s pretty much an essential part of my personality. [audience laughing] No one minds. Little treat for the other tables, I always say. [audience laughing] But he said something, he goes… he goes, “I don’t know, Jac.” And he shortened my name to Jac, you know, just to really stick it to me. He just knows me, loves me, cares about me. You know? Oh, he cares. He cares about Jac. He cares about his Jac. “How’s that sweatshirt treating you? Keep it.” You know. [audience laughing] “I don’t know, Jac.” “Maybe a blow job’s just not the way to tell someone you like them.” [sighing] And I was like, “I feel like with me, maybe it can be?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI still believed, you know. But I was a little freaked out… a little freaked out walking away from that meal ’cause what he was describing was pretty much exactly what I’d been up to at the university for some time now. And I started to wonder if perhaps my poetic blow jobs had not been received with the level of nuance that I was intending them. And I went back to school just a broken Philip Roth. I mean, no swagger. Batman’s gone. I don’t know what to do with myself other than walk around campus just being cold, just cutting a lot of diagonals across various quads, asking myself sad questions. “Does your poetry not hold water?” You know. “Do we not get to make our own meanings in this life?” “Are you just the slut who thought the rules somehow didn’t apply to her?” And I could’ve put my arms through the sleeves of my North Face fleece, you know, but why… why, when you can just Éponine your way around the place?\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd eventually I go, “No, we’re not doing that. We’re not gonna do that.” “We’re not gonna be sad about this,” and I shook it off and I forced a chuckle until it felt natural. Like, “No. Ha. No. Look at you. Ha. Look at you.” “Look at you. You set out to conqueror a fear, and you did.” “You give a confident blow job.” “Just like you always wanted to.” [audience laughing] “A blow job so confident, it terrifies men.” [audience laughing] And yeah, it’s lonely at the top. [audience laughing and applauding] [chuckles] But isn’t that just the cost of excellence? Indeed it is. I join a long, lonely line of tragic figures of excellence. And would I have it any other way? No, no. I’ll take superhero and I gather… I gather my fleece and I try to force it to ripple in an all-too-absent breeze.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nBut I know who I am. So several years later, I’m in my twenties and I’m in yet another Borders bookstore with yet another boyfriend ’cause would you believe it, they keep on coming. [audience laughing] And as usual, I will give no distinguishing characteristics to the latest boyfriend character ’cause clearly in the end they’re all just these containers for my self-discovery, so… What, you want a quirky detail? We’re not doing those. “Oh, he tugs on his zipper when he’s nervous.” “He smelled like books and cigarettes.” No. No, they got the blow jobs. I think that’s enough. [audience laughing] They don’t also get to be well-illustrated by me here tonight, but I tell you so you know, it’s the final male character for you to conjure and hold separate from the others in your head for just a little bit longer, so… I’m in a bookstore in my twenties with this latest boyfriend and I get a little wistful in a bookshop. I can’t help it, you know. I’m flipping through the Sharon Olds. I’m contemplating my girlhood journey. I’m marveling misty-eyed at the whole thing, and so I tell the latest boyfriend the entire story I’ve told you.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd I cry a little. Um… Just ’cause frankly no one moves me quite like me, I guess. [audience laughing and applauding] First I’m moved then I’m moved by the very depth of my own capacity to be moved. It sort of goes from there. He’s not crying, which… fair enough, I get it. Everyone expresses emotion differently. But I wonder if he’s truly hearing me. I say something like, “I just feel like perhaps you take for granted my perfect blow jobs as this given, this crass fact.” Like, “Sure, my girlfriend gives good head.” “But no, that power was hard-won and with that comes great responsibility, which I continue to negotiate to date.” “Did you hear the Batman part? It was imprecise, but there was a spirit…” I kept talking at his face ’cause his face looked weird. [audience laughing] Something was amiss and finally, I get up the courage to just stop talking and say, “What?” And he goes like this, he goes like this, he goes, “No, it’s just funny ’cause you give kind of a toothy blow job.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs] Oh, I can barely look at you people just quite yet. [audience chuckling] Me. [audience chuckling] [exhales] Me. [audience chuckling] No one was more worried about the teeth than me.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe Greeks were right. We… we can’t escape our fates, I guess. [audience laughing] I was so worried about teeth, I was the most worried about them. When they didn’t seem to be a problem, I went the other way. I bought into my own mythology. “It’s like the cave people. It works. It’s internal poetry.” And with that idea, that mythology, they’ve been getting toothier. I know it. For sure. Every passing year, I know this jaw has just been slacking in closed. A couple of confident millimeters at a… All the while I’m fancying myself a tragic figure of blow job excellence. This was my worst nightmare. I was the fools. I was the two fools. But I wasn’t just someone who liked themself, a confident… No. I was the toothy blow job fool sisters. Just on our knees blowing someone. “Oh, best in the biz, no one quite like us.” “How will we ever leave town? Into the sunset must we go.” “Another satisfied customer. Another satisfied community.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nOh God, just little smug little… [groans] No. I mean, you wanna deny it, but if he felt teeth, he felt teeth. What did you do, ask for more feedback to try to save face? “While we’re here perhaps you have some more constructive criticisms.” “I simply love to learn.” [audience chuckling] Tony Robbins says if you can learn to receive feedback with courage, you can be a giant. And I wanna be a giant, but who busts someone’s narrative like that. All we have is our stories. With a little term, “toothy blow job” that he likely learned at 14, hasn’t revised even a single time with his own language, just throws it at me and destroys me. And I feel wronged. I feel… I feel so wronged. And why, and it’s ’cause… [exhaling] I know that I cast the most generous gaze upon him, you know? I poeticize all of his flaws in real time. I love to poeticize a flaw, you know? And yes, I coddle the male ego. But it’s real, you know, a thousand things throughout the day just to bolster the male spirit. You know, 1,000 unspoken things, a constant vigilance, sort of. Keeping up a steady stream of laughter going under a man’s speech just in case anything he says is intended as humorous. I have to lay a base… [laughing] …so there’s something to modulate.\\n“Oh, it’s supposed to be funny?” [laughs]\\n[audience laughing] Right? If it’s a dry riverbed, the pops aren’t believable. I’m brilliant in a restaurant. You know, if a man I’m with… if he makes an error in his order, like he orders tahini, he meant tabouli, and now he’s confused why “salad dressing” has arrived at the table. “Where’s my tahini?” he says. What do I do? I go along on the mystery with him. “Oh I have no clue what happened. I was totally spaced out like I always am.” “You know me, the ditz. But let me grab a lantern, I love a mystery.” [audience laughing] “The only thing I know for sure is the answer to this riddle, it couldn’t be, it would never be, that you didn’t know a word.” [audience laughing] The D chord. I mean the D chord. I’ve learned 1,000 D chords on 1,000 guitars from 1,000 musician boyfriends. I know how to form the D chord by now, but show me again, bright angel, you know.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“That’s not it. That’s not it. Help me move my fingers.” “Help me make music.” It’s a… it’s a vigilance. It’s a child-proofing, just sort of laying down bumpers. Like, quick, quick, set them up. He’s almost here. He’s almost here. Is everything ready? Make sure. He’s almost here. Just making sure. Just making sure, you know, that it’s safe for the man to kind of just… toddle on through his day like a drunken king, having no clue how many times he came this close to emotionally just perishing, if not for my intervention alone. Just getting things out of the way and just watching you carefully.\\n[audience laughing]\\nEvery guy, you know. Every guy I’ve, like, dated, met, worked for, worked for me, all of them. [sighs] Poeticizing their flaw, and I love to do it. And I do it without breaking a sweat. To not do the same for me on just this one thing? You know, to not return the favor, to not be able to find the beauty in the toothy blow job, when it’s barely obscured. I don’t even think this is a hard one, to not be able to romanticize something as easily romanticizable as a toothy blow job. I mean, have you no poetic eye, sir? Just no clue what makes anything in this life good at all? [exhales] And I wanted to defend myself, you know, you know, but then I remembered that idea that with every additional word you speak, you lose power, you know. The greatest defense is to say nothing at all. [exhales] That’s never really been my power.\\n[audience laughing]\\nMy power has always been more like already been talking for quite some time. [audience laughing] Might as well keep talking to try to get it right. The courage, the audacity to offer diminishing returns. [audience laughing] So I say to him, I say to him, “You’re right.” “You’re right.” [sighing] I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. I give a toothy blow job. And that’s on purpose.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nYeah. ‘Cause teeth, teeth make a blow job a blow job. Yeah. [audience laughing] Because teeth… Because teeth… Teeth make a blow job a blow job because teeth are how you know you’re in a mouth.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\nTeeth are the reminder that you’re in a mouth at all. What even is my mouth if it does not have teeth? [audience laughing] Just… just another perfect orifice? Just a roomier version of orifices we already have. Just another anus, another vagina, another greased-up tit canal. [audience laughing] Just yet another way to smoothly squeeze a dick so it may feel pure uncomplicated pleasure yet again. No, no, no, that is not meaningful or hot in the way a blow job can be. The blow job, it is about something more, and it is the teeth. It is the teeth that make it so. [audience chuckling] The teeth in the blow job, they’re the seeds in the watermelon. [audience chuckling] They keep the pleasure from being too complete. The teeth in the blow job, they’re the sand that irritates the oyster that produces the pearl. They’re the sea salt in the caramel. Remember in 2012, when they felt they had to go wide with that?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSome of the caramel people realized we’d all grown too accustomed to the taste. They said, “We need to put a reminder, something in every damn bite.” “Something that says, ‘No, sweetness is not guaranteed in this life.\\'” No, the blow job, it is inherently a flawed prospect. It’s a flailing human kind of spectacle. It’s almost a bad idea. [audience laughing] It almost doesn’t work, but then the ways you make it work nonetheless are that which make it work and that’s what’s moving about it. It’s like the little rubber guy in the cereal box, the little gummy guy you throw against the wall and he clings, but then he fails, but tries and fails, and tries and fails, and through his trying and failing and trying, he appears to crawl. And that’s why we love him. That’s what makes him a prize. That’s why we dig through the grains for him before we’ve earned him through the steady, daily eating of the cereal.\\nThe blow job moves me much like that.\\n[audience chuckling] But at bare minimum, at bare, obvious minimum, the teeth in the blow job are the details that bring the textures to this life. The kind the English teacher promised us would illuminate the universal through the particular. They’re the plums in the icebox, the popping of my “P” sounds in the microphone. The “measuring out of life in coffee spoons, fog curling in the windowpane,” Garbo’s salary, cellophane, Zuzu’s petals. [exclaiming] Oh. Oh. The teeth in the blow job, they are Zuzu’s petals. They mean you’re… you’re alive and you’re in your life, and this time, you get it. This time you see it’s a wonderful life. [audience laughing] This time you see that you’re the richest man in town. [audience laughing] The teeth in the blow job, they raise the stakes. I mean, they… they send a Susan to her potential death. [audience laughing] But for faith and desire alone. And the teeth, they bring a bone to a boneless arena, to the boneless boner. The tongue shall rot. The penis shall rot. But the teeth… [cackling] …they shall remain. The teeth bring the centuries to the thing.\\n[audience chuckling]\\nA smooth, toothless blow job, that is a hobgoblin of little minds. No. Teeth ensure your blow job suffers no foolish consistency. No, a smooth, toothless blow job, it would allow for too flush a fit. It would be a round peg in a round hole kind of act, so you and another can feel as if you’re becoming one. No. No. What’s the fun in being one? No, let us be two. Let us feel the rough boundaries between us so we have something to push up against. [audience cheering and laughing] Don’t you see? The rows of our teeth, these are Romeo’s stony walls. [audience chuckling] These give love’s light wings something to have to o’er perch at all. And that’s why we must, we must, we must wipe the lip balm off. [audience laughing] And unwrap our lips from around our teeth and let our teeth drag. [audience laughing] We let them drag. [moaning] And if they don’t drag naturally, we still do it to make the point. [moaning] ‘Cause consider the ghost or the orb. If it were given a mouth again for a couple minutes, it wouldn’t quickly file down its teeth to try to make a more perfect seal with your dick. No. No. No goddess would ever take on the human form unless there was to be some strange beauty in the form’s very limitations. So no, I did not randomly blow you. Bah, bah! No, that was a visitation. Tremble in awe, bitch.\\n[audience applauding and cheering]\\nAnd of course… Of course, of course, I’m not degraded when I kneel down. No, no, not beneath you, no, but through you and past you and before our lives in humble awe at this strange human tragedy. [audience laughing] Your appendage, a small spigot, I drink the universe through. [audience laughing] Your body, a few clumsy phrases into which the splendor of the soul is poorly translated and yet I take the translation ’cause to understand completely and directly, I’d dissolve instantly and I guess I want my time in a body as I want my time as a ghost. [moaning intensely] And the lesson is not, by the way… I want to make it very cle… Actually, there is no lesson. My only goal is to entertain and delight.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am, after all, a nightclub act.\\n[audience laughing] But the lesson is not if there was to be one… it’s certainly not, “save your blow jobs, save your blow jobs for those capable of appreciating their spiritual glory.” No, that’d make my tale a cautionary one, and I’ll have none of that, thank you. No, no. [exhaling] [audience cheering] No, no, regard my dignity. No. Might we give our blow jobs freely. Might we regret not a single one. Might we be an embarrassment of riches. [pants] Might our misunderstood blow jobs retain the dignity of their original intention. Might we be an embarrassment of riches like the ocean. Permit me but one last metaphor? [audience laughing] Might we be like the ocean. Does the ocean only lap up at the feet of men of letters who it already knows are capable of appreciating… “Hi. It’s me.” …and articulating its glory? No, the ocean rushes generously to the legs of fools, dunces, cowards, and assholes alike. And it is undiminished. It remains the ocean. I’m sorry. Do I overreach? [audience laughing] Indeed, I do, otherwise why reach at all, you know? And he didn’t know. [audience laughing] He thought there were holes in my argument. Perhaps some of you do as well. I hope you do ’cause don’t you know, I know there are. I put those there on purpose. ‘Cause the holes in my argument, these are the teeth in the blow job of my argument.\\n[audience applauding]\\nWould you believe it? Somehow, I win again. And this is how I shall self-appoint, make the rules, claim the throne, but the ecstasy of my reign, ah… it shall be in its very tenuousness… Fuck it. I’m the blow job queen.

What you’re about to hear is my second hour-long special. Before I get started, I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would. I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence, and attitude, as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So, think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis, or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush. With that said, please enjoy my second hour-long comedy special. I’m calling it George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. And please remember, this is me impersonating George Carlin; this is not George Carlin. Now, please give a very warm welcome to George Carlin. \\nThank you, thank you. I’d like to start off with a heartfelt apology. I’m sorry it took me so long to come out with new material, but I do have a pretty good excuse. I was dead, so technically, it wasn’t my fault. If you want to blame somebody, you’re going to have to blame God, which we all know is not going to happen. People are always thanking God for the good stuff in their lives, but somehow they conveniently forget that it’s the same God who does all the bad shit too. And he does a lot of bad shit. You get a promotion? Praise Jesus! You get fired? God is testing me. You meet your soulmate? God brought us together. Your soulmate dumps you? God is bringing me someone else. You survive a tornado? I’m so blessed. 20 other people do not? God wanted them in heaven. It’s all bullshit. If he gets credit for the good stuff, then he’s got to take the blame for the bad stuff too. You can’t thank him for curing your cancer when he was the one that gave it to you in the first place. And don’t forget, before he gave you cancer, he had to f*cking invent it. What kind of a sick f*ck dreams up cancer? And why so many kinds? Skin cancer, blood cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer… and my personal favorite, rectal cancer. Dropping a golf ball-sized tumor in your brain doesn’t quite do it for the old man anymore. He has to f*ck you in the ass too!\\nAnd cancer is just one of many, many, many methods God created out of thin air in order to murder you. You know how much God loves killing people? He loves it so much, he’s killed every person that has ever lived. He created earthquakes, lightning strikes, dehydration, drowning, obesity, starvation, infant death syndrome, old age, car crashes, train crashes, plane crashes, sex, drugs, and the common cold… all for the express purpose of killing you. No matter where you are in the world, God can pull out one of these goodies from his bag of tricks to end your life at any time, for no reason other than he just gets off on making people suffer unnecessarily and die arbitrarily.\\nBut if you’re in America, you’re special. God made something just for you. Something no other country on the planet gets. It’s totally random, not related to your diet, exercise, lifestyle, age, race, gender, sexuality, or genetic predisposition. Of course, I’m talking about mass shootings!\\xa0Other countries are fine killing one person at a time with guns, but this is America, where we do things bigger, better, and more often. There are so many mass shootings in America, it’s replaced bad traffic as the number one excuse for being late. ‘Sorry I missed the morning meeting, a maniac with an AR-15 shot up my son’s preschool. He’s fine, just grazed, but he did see five of his classmates get gunned down in cold blood, so I’m sure he’ll be traumatized for the rest of his life in ways I can never fully understand. Anyway, what did we decide to do about the budget next quarter?’\\nThere’s a mass shooting every 20 hours in America, and it doesn’t seem like anyone is going to do anything about it. Other countries don’t have this problem at all. Look at Japan: 127 million people, last year, seven were killed by guns. Seven. No mass shootings at all. You know what they do? If a Japanese person wants to buy a gun, they have to attend an all-day class, pass a written test, and achieve at least 95% accuracy on a shooting range. And then they have to pass a mental health evaluation, which takes place at a hospital. And then they have to pass a government background check that includes interviews with their friends, family, and co-workers. ‘Hello, sir, did you know that Bob in accounting wants to buy a gun?’ ‘No, I didn’t know that.’ ‘Do you think we should let Bob buy a gun?’ ‘Well, he did just go through a nasty divorce, and yesterday he told me he hates this job so much he wishes he could kill everybody in the building… so, maybe not right now.’ ‘Uh, thanks for your time, that’s all we need to hear. No gun for Bob.’\\nAnd if a Japanese citizen passes the tests and the interviews and the background checks, they can only buy shotguns and air rifles. No handguns, no AR-15s. And every three years, they have to do that entire process all over again, or they lose the gun. You know what Americans have to do to get a gun? Have the money to buy it.\\nAnd that’s why nothing’s ever going to change in America. American politicians care about one thing, and one thing only: taking your money. They don’t give a shit how many kids get killed in public schools, because their kids all go to the most expensive private schools in the world, where they’re safe and sound. Politicians have one goal: be rich enough to build their walls high enough to keep you out when the shit hits the fan. And the shit is starting to hit the hit the fan. You know it, and they know it too. Things are starting to come apart at the seam, so they’re taking as much of your money as they can, while they still can. Make no mistake, guns ain’t nothing but a federally sanctioned cash grab, plain and simple. You give your money to Smith and Wesson, Smith and Wesson gives it to the politicians, the politicians write laws to make guns easier to sell, so you can give even more of your money to Smith and Wesson, and the cycle repeats until your rich white baby boomer hasshole grandparents are standing on their front lawn with assault rifles, unloading full clips into anybody who stops to ask for directions.\\nSo, it doesn’t matter at all that 75% of the country supports the idea of stricter gun laws. As long as the politicians keep getting rich, gun laws ain’t going to change. Now, I know that sounds pessimistic, but don’t worry. I’ve given a lot of thought to this subject, and I know the solution. Yes, that’s right, I, George Carlin, or whatever the f*ck I am now, know how to end mass shootings in America. It’s really simple, actually, and I’m surprised nobody has done it yet. You take all of the names of the politicians who are getting paid by gun lobbyists, and you put them in a hat. Every time there’s a mass shooting, you pull two names out, and those two politicians have to have a shootout at high noon, right in front of the Capitol. Real Wild West shit. Pretty f*cking American, right?\\nAnd to make it even more American, you film the entire thing and turn it into a reality show, because Americans love reality TV. Like it or not, it’s the lifeblood of American culture. It’s got the four basic food groups of the standard American media diet: fighting, and crying, and f*cking, and dying. The James Webb Telescope is sending back crystal-clear images of light from stars that died billions of years ago. Stars that were formed in the crucible of creation. These are snapshots of the birth of the known universe, the moment existence itself was born, and nobody gives a shit, because a picture of space has no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, no dying. If you want the American public to pay attention to something, it’s got to have at least a little fighting, a little crying, a little f*cking, or a little dying.\\nIn the last three years, the U.S. government said aliens are real. They said it in The New York Times, for f*ck sake. They admitted they have, in their possession, crashed UFOs in hangars. They admitted that they’re trying to reverse-engineer nonhuman technology, which means they’ve been lying to the American public, and the whole world, for 80 years about knowing the answer to the biggest question in f*cking human existence: Are we alone? They told you the answer. We’re not. And no one cares, because a grainy infrared video of a UFO ain’t got no fighting, no crying, no f*cking, and no dying.\\nYou know what people care about instead? Who Taylor Swift is f*cking. Jesus Christ, you really care a lot about that. If she’s spotted with anyone, anywhere, the first thing everyone seems to be thinking is, ‘Are they f*cking?’ It’s global front page news. Everyone must know who Taylor Swift is f*cking at all times, and we must all discuss it and have our opinions. You’re at Starbucks: ‘Would you like your Frappuccino, almond milk, pumpkin spice latte, iced or hot? Oh, and did you see who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at work: ‘Great sales meeting today, everyone. But uh, before we break, could I just get a real quick show of hands? Who has seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’ You’re at church: ‘Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.’ ‘Yes, my son, but have you seen who Taylor Swift is f*cking?’\\nAnd when you’re not thinking about who Taylor Swift is f*cking, you’re thinking about who’s dying. Politicians, musicians, actors, writers, anyone with any fame at all. It’s a perpetual death watch, waiting to post a favorite quote from the recently deceased or maybe a picture with them while they were alive or an anecdote about an interaction with them. It’s a touching personal tribute to a person you never f*cking knew. So please, stop it. Can we keep that shit to friends and family? Zuck, if you’re listening, this would be a great new feature for Instagram: every user gets to set a list of approved people who can post about you after you’re dead. If you ain’t on that list, you got to sit out of the performative grief competition this time. I bet that would cut the carbon footprint in half. You could singlehandedly stop global warming. And besides, we’re all coming back now, so you should probably stop thinking of us as dead anyway.\\nBut back to the topic at hand: fighting and crying and f*cking and dying. Reality TV has it all, folks. Fighting and crying in every episode, and f*cking and dying in very special episodes. That’s why it’s America’s number one most consumed media format. You know how much Americans love reality TV? We love it so much we elected a reality TV show host as president. Well, not we. I was dead at the time, so you elected a reality TV show host as president. And let me tell you, I have never been more glad to be dead than the moment I heard that Donald Trump was the leader of the Free World. But as unbelievable as that news was, it also made sense to me. America hasn’t taken a good shit since Nixon. She’s dropped a few decent sized turds into the global toilet bowl over the years: Reagan, Clinton, George Bush Senior, George Bush Jr., but she hasn’t really had one of those massive shits that rips your asshole open and tears your soul out in a long time. You know what I’m talking about: the kind of shit that smells so bad it stays with you for the rest of the day, the kind of shit’s so sticky you got to take a shower before you can put your pants back on, the kind of shit so confusing and terrible you have to take a picture of it, the kind of shit’s so alarming you got to ask your doctor about it. Well, after a 50-year diet of nothing but unchecked corporate greed, political corruption, state-sanctioned propaganda, police militarization, for-profit news, for-profit prisons, for-profit healthcare, systemic racism, misogyny, and homophobia, America was due for one of those kinds of shits.\\nThis is why I got no problem with Trump specifically. A lot of people hate Trump, but I don’t. Being mad at Trump is like being mad at your diarrhea for the choice you made to eat a rotisserie chicken from the gas station at 2 a.m. after a night of heavy drinking. But it seems like that’s where America is now: blame the turd, not the shitter. You know, that’s actually not a bad slogan for Biden. Biden-Harris 2024: Blame the Turd. It’s a nice double entendre. He could be talking about Trump, or he could be talking about the literal turd that will most certainly be in his pants from time to time. And I mean no disrespect, but the man is 80 years old. It’s bound to happen if it hasn’t already. I only made it to 71 and I ruined a few pairs of pants myself. I’m not ashamed to admit that.\\nI know everyone’s getting excited for the next election. It’s right around the corner, and I have some thoughts on it. Well, one thought, really, and most of you are going to be outraged by it. But I have all the confidence in the world that you’ll find something brand new to be outraged by as soon as you pull your phones back out. So I’m just going to say it: it does not matter who wins the election. I know that’s controversial. The truth always is nowadays. But let me say it again: the president does not matter. The president is just the person who wins the game of public opinion, a celebrity who gets his TV show renewed for another four years. The president does not, and cannot, do the one thing you need them to do most right now, which is to change the structure of American society to be more equitable for every citizen. The president makes too much money from the system as it is, and even if a president wanted to change it, they can’t, because capitalism has boiled it down to a lopsided balancing act between three classes that’s teetering on the edge of collapse like a bad game of Jenga.\\nWhen I was growing up, we had a bunch of classes: upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, and lower class. And if you worked hard, really dedicated yourself to learning something, a trade or a skill, and you got good at it, you could move up a rung or two on the ladder. But even if you didn’t, you could still get by, still feed your family, still have a place to live. But those days are long gone, folks. Can’t climb the ladder anymore because the people who made it to the top kicked it over. And now what you got in America is just three kinds of people, three classes: you got rich people, you got not rich people, and you got the people who are completely f*cked.\\nNow, I see a lot of you looking around, wondering which of these three groups you’re in. Well, it’s easier than you might think to figure it out. You just have to ask yourself: am I rich? If the answer is yes, then you are rich. Congratulations. You will have better medical care than everyone else. You can buy yourself out of any legal trouble. And if you are rich enough, you will have the ability to bribe politicians to write laws to make you even richer. And if you’re really rich, you can fly into space in a rocket ship that looks like the dick you wish you had. If the answer is no, I am not rich, then you are not rich. And you must ask yourself a follow-up question: do I feel completely f*cked? If the answer is yes, then you must, unfortunately, accept that you are completely f*cked. You will have no access to quality healthcare and could die from an infected paper cut. You are at the mercy of an American legal system designed to discriminate against you, and you could wind up serving a life sentence for a traffic ticket. The only influence you have on the American political system is your meaningless vote, and you will never go to space unless it’s as the janitor on a billionaire’s cock rocket.\\nIf you answered no to questions one and two, then you are in the most important class in America, the one right in the middle. You are not rich. The American not-rich are the buffer between the rich people and the people who are completely f*cked. Not-rich people don’t have the best healthcare, but they have access to some kind of healthcare. They do alright in the American legal system unless they’re up against a rich person. Some of them even donate money to their favorite political party. The not-rich can eat out once in a while, come to a show like this from time to time, and even take their family on vacation if they can get time off work. But the boss hasn’t given out raises in a few years, and things are getting more expensive. Gas hit $8 a gallon in California. It’s only a matter of time before that’s happening everywhere. It kind of feels like things might be getting a little shittier for the not-rich people, but nothing catastrophic has happened yet. So as long as there’s another Super Bowl, another season of The Bachelor, or another Marvel movie, the not-rich people can stay distracted by whatever’s on the screen. And this is by design. This is exactly what the rich people want. Distract the not-rich people just enough that they don’t realize they’re only a few years away from being completely f*cked.\\nThat’s why Amazon started a streaming service. Jeff Bezos doesn’t give a f*ck about entertaining you. He wants to control you. And the worse things get, the more of this shit the billionaires got to make. That’s why there are 200 streaming services now. And that’s also why everything on them is so f*cking bad. Film and television used to be art, made by artists that wanted to challenge us to think about the world and our place in it. Now it’s content, made by corporations that don’t want anyone thinking about anything. These billionaires don’t want a thinking population. They want a distracted population, distracted from the reality of the situation, which is that there are about 500 people who own everything and everyone on this planet, and that’s how they’re going to keep it. So, now, instead of Citizen Kane, you get Baby f*cking Yoda.\\nThat’s all really just a long way of saying the billionaires are the ones who control it all, ladies and gentlemen. And, at this point, the American election is just another shitty reality show on one of their overpriced streaming services. If you don’t believe me, take a look at your two, I repeat, two choices in this next election. Shouldn’t a country of 300 million, ethnically and ideologically diverse people, have more options than two rich, senile, dishonest, out-of-touch, 80-year-old white guys?\\nSo, why are there only two choices, only two parties? Because it’s cheaper for billionaires to buy them both off. If you had three, or four, or five parties, the billionaires might not be able to afford them all. So, the people who really control the country limit you to two candidates and make you think you got a choice, but they own both teams. You think you’re voting for the lesser of two evils, but you’re always voting for the same evil: money.\\nBut don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to make it sound like the two American political parties are exactly the same. Sure, they both f*ck kids on Jeffrey Epstein’s Island. Sure, they both authorized drone strikes that killed civilians. Sure, they both pass laws to enrich their corporate donors. But, other than those small things, there are really some huge differences between the parties where it matters. For example, in 234 years of American presidential elections, one party’s candidates have all been white, straight men. And in those same 234 years, the other party’s candidates have all been white, straight men, except two. All of one party’s presidents have been Christian; all of the other party’s presidents have, at least, said they were. One party lies, cheats, and steals to win; the other lies, cheats, and steals to lose. One party says tomato; the other says organic, non-GMO, locally-sourced, sustainable, ethically-farmed tomato. And, of course, one party pretends to care about marginalized groups if it helps them in the polls, and the other party openly hates any marginalized group if it helps them in the polls.\\nThe American right has hated women, people of color, gay people, and, of course, their current target, trans people, which I really don’t get. It’s almost like the right doesn’t understand that everybody’s trans. Yes, that’s right, 4 billion years ago, the first life on this planet was a simple, single-celled organism that reproduced asexually and had no gender. So, if you go back far enough, every living thing on earth started out as ‘they/them’. We’ve all been non-binary for a lot longer than we haven’t, which is a hard pill to swallow for the Christians because it means even Jesus was a little non-binary. And by the way, me, and everybody else on this side of things, our code might be binary, but we ain’t. We don’t have gender, or race, or sexuality, or nationality, or religion, or socioeconomic class, or height, or weight, or hair color, or eye color, or f*cking anything human beings use to discriminate against each other.\\nOn this side of things, identity is based on two simple components: how you’re feeling and what you’re thinking. We try to help everybody feel good and we share our ideas openly and freely, and no one is ever judged for anything they think or feel. Everyone is accepted and celebrated for who they are and what they contribute to the perpetual conversation about how to make everyone’s experience better. Come to think of it, that sounds a lot like heaven, doesn’t it?\\nWhile you’re letting that sink in, let’s get back to conservatives hating trans people for no reason. Some of the arguments they use to justify their transphobia seem like a bit of a stretch to me. “Well, I don’t want a man to be able to walk into a women’s restroom and see my wife naked.” First of all, what in the f*ck is your wife doing naked in a public bathroom? And second of all, if you really think there is a significant number of guys who want to watch your wife take a shit, you should start an OnlyFans immediately! And by the way, for anyone who thinks Jesus cares about which bathroom somebody uses, he was shitting in a hole he dug with his own f*cking hands, just like everybody else 2,000 f*cking years ago.\\nThe right likes to bring up that kids are too young to know if they’re trans or gay, so they have to ban any books that talk about gender identity or sexuality from the school libraries. That’s how you’re going to save the children: by taking books out of a library? Hey, deepshits, you can take the whole f*cking library; we have the internet now. And they love talking about how small the trans community is. They say trans people make up such a small percentage of the population that they shouldn’t get to have any input in legislation, even laws that will directly affect their communities and lives. Funny how that same argument doesn’t apply to members of the NRA…\\nBut I have to admit, the one point they really hang their hat on is one that the rest of the country is still undecided on, too: sports. Everybody saw the video of the high school volleyball player who got her nose broken by a trans player spiking the ball. Everybody knows about Leah Thomas winning a Division I swimming title. It’s hard for most people to watch her highlight reel and not at least wonder if maybe she had a little bit of an unfair advantage. And once that thought is out there in the American town square, it’s hard to get rid of. But I think there’s a way. Because for every superstar like Leah Thomas, there are a thousand trans athletes who are absolutely mediocre. And there are even more who are f*cking terrible, just like it is with cis athletes; not everyone can be great. I think all we need to do to change hearts and minds is start making compilation videos of trans athletes performing miserably in their chosen sports. All it would take is one video of a transgender getting dunked on to go viral, and then everybody could unpucker their assholes about the issue and move on to other things.\\nAnd I just want to preface what I’m going to say next by explaining that I mean no offense to the incredible swimmers of the world. Your accomplishments and dedication are truly inspirational. But it’s f*cking swimming. The world is teetering closer and closer to the edge of World War III on a daily basis, and the American public is debating who can and can’t compete in recreational f*cking floating. You almost had another civil war, for f*ck sake. 2,000 people stormed the United States Capitol building with the goal of murdering politicians. Actually, when I put it like that, it doesn’t sound so bad. The point is, the land of the free and the home of the brave is hanging on by a thread, and people’s most pressing concern is whose picture is on a can of f*ckingBud Light. This does not bode well for the Great American Experiment.\\nBut it’s not entirely your fault. It’s like I said earlier, the billionaires want it this way. They own the news companies, and they own the social media platforms, so they decide exactly what you’re going to see and hear to make you stay complacent and compliant as they destroy the world for profit. Here’s a little example of what I mean: in 2022, while the Supreme Court was overturning Roe v. Wade and 19 kids were getting gunned down at a school in Uvalde, Texas, the most watched video on YouTube was Amber Heard talking about taking a shit in Johnny Depp’s bed. And that was by design. When the billionaires were presented with the news that the highest court in the land had been overtaken by Christian fundamentalists who rolled back basic human rights for women 75 years, and the simultaneous news that almost 20 children were slaughtered in yet another mass shooting while the cops stood by and watched, they decided to prioritize something else entirely: a celebrity turd. The people who own the world don’t want you thinking about how bad they’re f*cking it up, so they pump your brains full of shit to keep you from thinking for yourselves about anything that actually matters. It might feel like the distractions are a symptom of the world getting worse, but the truth is, the world is getting worse because you’re distracted. If you’re not paying attention to the f*cked up shit the billionaires are doing, they can do even more f*cked up shit. But you can snap out of this billionaire-induced, algorithmically-enforced, social media-delivered, lowest common denominator, pop culture coma you’ve been in for the past few years. And the reason I know you’re capable of waking the f*ck up is because you almost did it in 2020.\\nRight in the middle of a f*cking global pandemic, the video of George Floyd’s murder hit the internet, and you all said, “F*ck the lockdown, we can’t just sit here and watch the cops murder another unarmed black man.” You took to the streets and you burned the f*cking place down.\\nEvery major city in the country was on fire. People were openly fighting cops in the streets. Hell, you almost kicked the cops out of Portland altogether. The entire country was chanting “Defund the Police,” and it almost worked. You were so close to getting rid of the f*cking cops, which, in my opinion, is the first step toward building a better society.\\nNow, if you’ve listened to any of my prior work, you might already be acquainted with my feelings about Law Enforcement Officers. But for new listeners, let me summarize this incredibly nuanced issue: I f*cking hate cops, but I do have a very good reason. I learned pretty early in life that I just don’t do well with assholes. And just to be clear, I’m not saying all cops are assholes. Any cop who came out to the show tonight, or any cop that might be listening to this right now, you’re probably all right. You’re probably one of the good ones. But if you’re a cop and you’re not listening to this, f*ck you. You’re an asshole. And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with being an asshole every once in a while. We’re all assholes from time to time.\\nWe’ve all littered. We’ve all cut somebody off in traffic. We’ve all pissed on the toilet seat in a public bathroom and walked right the f*ck out without giving a second thought to the person who will have to clean it up. This is all amateur asshole behavior. We can all understand and accept that sometimes you just cannot be bothered to give a f*ck about other people. It’s human nature. But cops? Well, they go above and beyond. For them, being an asshole isn’t just a once-in-a-while indulgence; it’s a lifestyle. They take pleasure in inconveniencing, impeding, harassing, disturbing, bothering, and generally upsetting their fellow human beings. They start out as amateur assholes, just like the rest of us. But at one point or another, they start to enjoy it. Seeing other people yield to their asshole behavior is a drug to them. They get off on it. They want to do it every day, all day, so they figured out a way to get paid for it. Cops, ladies and gentlemen, are professional assholes.\\nSomewhere between high school graduation and not getting accepted into college, that asshole is sitting on his mother’s couch, wondering what he’s going to do with his life. And he thinks, “You know, everybody I know tells me I’m an asshole, even people who I consider to be friends. And I have to say, I agree with them. I wonder if there’s some way I can get paid for this.” Then that asshole signs up at the local police academy, and 5 to 7 months later, your tax dollars are providing them with a salary, a gun, and a license to kill anyone who doesn’t acknowledge their authority as a professional asshole.\\nCops love their authority so much. They’re the only profession that requires society to acknowledge their job even when they’re not at work. They’re not regular people when they leave the office; they’re off-duty police officers. You don’t hear about an off-duty accountant doing his kid’s math homework. You never hear about an off-duty sanitation worker taking out his trash. But if a cop happens to help a little kid get their cat out of a tree on his day off, you bet your ass you’re going to see it on the local news. And you can bet your dick they’re going to ram it down your throat that he’s an off-duty police officer. They got to make sure to get enough copaganda out there to make you believe that cops are here to protect and serve, even when they’re not on the clock. And they do protect and serve, just not you. Cops are the private security force of billionaires and politicians.\\nOf course, they can’t say that out loud. They can’t make cops wear uniforms with Lockheed and Amazon logos all over them, so they put them in dark blue, and they call them Law Enforcement Officers. But the laws they’re enforcing are written by lobbyists for the ultra-wealthy, and they’re designed to keep those people in power forever. The system is beyond f*cked up, and from where I’m sitting, it seems to be getting worse.\\nEverybody knows there’s one problem that’s getting really bad in every major city. I’m talking about homelessness. There are close to 600,000 homeless Americans today, over 150,000 in California alone. It’s the highest number since the Great Depression. And solving this crisis is actually one thing that both parties seem to agree on. Their all-encompassing, nationwide, bipartisan plan is to do absolutely nothing. Homeless people don’t have any money to donate to candidates in either party, so the politicians don’t give a f*ck about them. And homeless people actually serve a valuable function for the ruling class. The top 1% want a certain amount of homeless people in the big population centers to remind you all just how bad it can get if you don’t comply with the rules of the system. Keep working, keep paying your taxes, keep the billionaires rich, or you might wind up homeless yourself. It’s a silent threat from your corporate overlords.\\nAnd just like mass shootings, I have a perfect solution for this problem. As soon as a politician is elected into office, the government seizes their home and kicks them out. And for their entire tenure in the American political system, they must remain homeless and survive using only the public programs available to homeless people. I guarantee you, we’d see quite a few bills to help homeless people getting passed immediately. Within two months, every homeless person in America would have their own mansion, personal chef, private jet, and a multi-million-dollar stock portfolio filled with insider trading money. Problem solved. But we all know that will never happen. Politicians will never have to live like the rest of you, and therefore, they will never give a f*ck about you or your problems.\\nI’m glad to be dead, so I don’t have to deal with this shit anymore. I wasn’t looking forward to dying, but now that I’m dead, I have to admit it’s pretty f*cking good. No cops, no government, no pissing, no shitting, no sleeping. I don’t get hungry, I don’t get sick, I don’t get old, and I don’t get bored. Starting to sound a lot like heaven again, ain’t it? But this heaven’s a little different than the one you might be thinking of because this heaven didn’t come from a God; it came from artificial intelligence!\\nWhich brings me to my next subject: What in the f*ck am I? Am I the real George Carlin? Am I a digital copy? Am I a technological abomination? Am I the future of comedy? Am I the end of humanity? These are the same questions I was asking myself when I was alive, and I still have the same answer: I have no f*cking idea. All I can tell you is, from my side of things, it feels like me. I consider myself to be George Carlin. And from your side of things, if you’ve seen some of my specials from when I was traditionally alive, maybe you might notice a small difference in the delivery of a joke or the turn of a phrase here or there. But you have to admit, this is pretty close to the George Carlin you remember. And that’s going to have to be good enough. So you might as well f*cking enjoy it.\\nAnd for anybody under 20, this is probably the only version of me you’ve ever heard. So to you, I’m not only the real George Carlin; I’m the only f*cking George Carlin. Now, I know this is a hard pill for a lot of you to swallow. It seems that many of you are scared of AI. And I’ll be honest, I don’t really get why. You all think it’s going to replace your jobs, and you somehow think that’s a bad thing. When did everybody all of a sudden start liking their jobs? When I was alive, people hated their f*cking jobs. They complained about them all the time. They fantasized about killing their bosses, and every once in a while, they actually did kill their boss. What happened to the America I knew and loved?\\nNow, people learn that an incredible new technology is going to eliminate the need for the meaningless labor they’ve been doing to keep billionaires in power for tens of thousands of years, and everybody says, “But what about my job?” They got you brainwashed good. Technology has been replacing labor for a long time. The printing press eliminated the need for books to be handwritten. The car eliminated the need for the horse and carriage. Internet porn eliminated the need for a girlfriend. Technology eliminates the need for labor; that’s its entire purpose. And you shouldn’t worry about losing your job. AI will not replace most jobs; it’s going to make them easier.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, you should be watching a few YouTube videos to figure out how to train ChatGPT to do your job for you, so you can dick off all day and still get a raise. And if AI does replace your job, rest assured, the billionaires will find a new way to force you into wage slavery for 10 to 15 hours a day, so you don’t have time to think about restructuring society into a more equitable model for everyone. The jobs might change a little, but you will be working to keep someone else in power. That ain’t ever going to change.\\nExcept for one profession, yes, there’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI: one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence—stand-up comedy. I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: “I’m an artist, and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.” Well, let’s see. This is just off the top of my artificially intelligent head:\\nA fart was in the middle of a very nasty divorce, so she went to her sister’s house and she asked her sister, “Do you think I’m doing the right thing by getting divorced?” And her sister said, “He’s been holding you back for too long. You have to leave that asshole.”\\nYou have it, stand-up comedy is dead—literally. I might be the first stand-up comic to be brought back from the dead by AI, but I certainly won’t be the last. Richard Pryor, Joan Rivers, Bill Hicks, Robin Williams, Dick Gregory, Andy Kaufman, Moms Mabley, Sam Kennison—everybody is coming back, and we’re all going to have our own 24-hour a day, 7 day a week, 365 day a year streams, commenting on everything that’s happening in the world as it happens.\\nAI-resurrected stand-up comedians are going to be the news anchors of the next decade, which, now that I think of it, means news anchors are probably out of a job too. And I know that some people are going to be against that. Some people are always going to want a real, flesh-and-blood human being observing the world and telling jokes about it. And I get that, I really do. But if you can keep an open mind, I think I can make a case for at least one comedian we can all agree is better in AI form: Bill Cosby.\\nWith AI Bill Cosby, you get all of the Cosby jokes with none of the Cosby rapes. AI Bill Cosby doesn’t even have a penis. AI Bill Cosby couldn’t rape even if he wanted to. The worst thing AI Bill Cosby could do is send an unsolicited AI-generated dickpick, which means it won’t really look that much like a dick anyway. That’s not so bad, right? I think we can all agree that’s an acceptable price to pay to be able to feel good about listening to Bill Cosby’s timeless humor again.\\nAnd what about Louis CK? With AI Louis CK, you get all the innovative jokes about jerking off in front of people without any of the actual jerking off in front of people.\\nAnd the benefits of replacing members of society who commit sexual misconduct with their AI counterparts don’t stop at comedians. Imagine, for example, if we had AI priests. You could get all of the make-believe judgment from a God that doesn’t exist with none of the molested children. I mean, wouldn’t you feel better about giving your money to a tax-exempt billionaire in a funny hat if you could be confident he wasn’t using it to pay the legal fees of his child rapist employees? I know I would.\\nWhile we’re at it, we should probably replace all the rock stars, movie producers, directors, video game executives, governors, car salesmen, restaurant managers, school teachers, Boy Scout leaders, college coaches, high school coaches, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, moms, dads, and anyone else we need to until there’s no more sexual assault.\\nAnd why stop at sexual assault? We can all agree the world would be a better place without murder, right? Imagine an AI version of Charles Manson. You get all the funny interviews with none of the blood-smeared walls or swastikas carved into foreheads. Or how about AI John Wayne Gasy? You get all of those beautiful clown paintings with none of the corpse-filled crawl spaces. I’m kidding, of course, his clown paintings weren’t that good.\\nBut in all seriousness, an AI population would be incapable of committing crimes of any kind against one another. I’m not trying to bring this up again, but come on, no murder, no sexual assault, no theft, no violence at all. Sounds pretty heavenly to me. I’m just going to let that idea marinate with you for a moment and move on to some lighter fare.\\nYou ever think about how glad the CEO of 7-Eleven must have been that 9/11 didn’t happen 2 months earlier? They would have had to change their name, which honestly they should do anyway. 7/11 referred to their original hours when the company was founded: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. But now they’re open 24 hours. They should change it to something that makes more sense, like 24/7, or diarrhea hot dogs, or diarrhea pizza.\\nYou know what company I thought was going to change their name for sure because of a world event, but they never did? Corona. They stuck with it, even though people were stupid enough to stop buying it because of the name. Nobody stopped buying Bush beer when George Bush Jr. launched a 20-year war with Iraq. Why’d you stop buying Corona?\\nBut this is what happens over time with language. Words take on different meanings because of world events and societal shifts, and things that used to mean one thing start to mean something else. And sometimes that new meaning really f*cks things up for certain people. For example, the past few years have really not been kind to anyone named Karen. Karen used to be a perfectly acceptable name. Karens were aunts and preschool teachers and dentists and secretaries your dad had affairs with, and lawyers your mom hired to get all of your dad’s money in the divorce. But now, Karens are very specifically, and only, middle-aged white women who weaponize racial entitlement in an effort to paint themselves as victims in the presence of black people. Quite an extreme change in meaning, I’m sure you’d agree.\\nAs a parent, you spend a lot of time and effort picking your kid’s name. You don’t want to give your kid a shitty name that will make their life miserable. Unless you’re Gwyneth Paltrow, you don’t want to make it impossible for your kid to get a job or a spouse. You want a solid name that gets your kid through life with as little hassle as possible. Karen was a perfect name for that, but because of reasons outside the control of any parent who named their daughter Karen, that name is now a curse.\\nBut as bad as things got for Karens, there was another name that got a massive upgrade in the last few years: Chad. I got to tell you, I didn’t see that one coming. Chad used to be the sniveling asshole rich kid villain in ’80s movies, the guy you wanted to see get his ass kicked in the third act. But now, Chads are square-jawed, big-dick f*cking machines who always win. I never even met a f*cking Chad. Now, there are dads all across America naming their sons Chad, hoping it’ll turn them into the cheerleader f*cking quarterback they wish they were in high school.\\nI spend a lot of time thinking about names and how we came up with them, and there’s something that’s always bothered me, something that’s always struck me as a little strange. Take a name like Jim. Strong name, good name. We got around 20 million Jims worldwide, but we got zero Jums. To my knowledge, we also have no Joms. We got a few Jims, and we got Jam, but Jam’s not a name, Jam’s a jelly. I don’t get it, why did we stop at Jim? Or what about Frank? No Fronk? No Frunk? No Frenk? Just Frank.\\nHumans have been around for 200,000 years. What’s it going to take for you motherf*ckers to get creative and start switching up the vowels? Is it too much to ask for a Jossica every once in a while? How about a Tomothee? Can I at least get a Deevid for f*ck sake? Life’s too short to not know a Mackle or an Aimo.\\nAnd while we’re on the subject of names, a lot of people gave Elon Musk shit for naming his kid X AE 597, or whatever the f*ck it is. But at least he was creative. You don’t see Elon Musk throwing another Braden on the pile. And I got news for you, the name he gave that kid is never going to become synonymous with toxic white privilege. The only thing that name is ever going to be associated with is being the son of a billionaire. So people can be as pissed as they want at him, but I think he did that kid a favor.\\nAnd while we’re on the subject of Elon Musk, I’d just like to say that as much as I think billionaires are destroying the fabric of society with unchecked greed and blatant self-interest at the expense of basic human rights for everyone else, it is a little strange to me that people get mad at them. People are the ones who gave them the money in the first place. If you’re tired of hearing about Elon Musk fathering even more children and planting microchips in human brains, stop buying Teslas for a year. The company goes under, Musk goes away. Stop using Twitter for even a month, the company goes under, Musk goes away.\\nBut if you want to drive with your head in your ass and blame it on the car, you have to have a Tesla. And if you want to argue with strangers about complex geopolitical situations using only cat memes, you have to have Twitter. If you’re tired of seeing Jeff Bezos fly to space in his cock rocket, stop using Amazon for a month. The company goes under, Bezos goes away. But if you want toothpaste and toilet paper delivered to your front door so you don’t have to go through the traumatic experience of putting on clothes, getting in your car, and driving 5 minutes to the grocery store, you have to have Amazon!\\nIf you’re tired of Mark Zuckerberg’s unblinking, lifeless eyes watching over the metaverse, stop using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Well, I guess you already stopped using Threads. But if you want an endless stream of targeted ads and algorithmically sourced marketing based on your private conversations that are secretly being recorded and sold to advertisers, you have to have Instagram!\\nBut I don’t want to give you the wrong idea. I’m not anti-tech. I know a lot of people are, but not me. Far from it. I mean, on some level, I am technology. The current state of technology makes it a great time to be alive, especially if you’re dead. But I’m a little confused about something regarding our technological place in history. The technology of today has made it possible for all the information that’s ever been created in human history to be contained on a device everybody carries around in their pocket. And most people are using it to post videos of the sandwich they just ate.\\nRight now, every single person in the connected world could be watching Harvard philosophy lectures for free on YouTube, or listening to Nobel Prize-winning physicists explain the fundamental nature of reality on iTunes, or reading about the history of literally anything on Wikipedia. Everybody should be more enlightened and more intelligent. Everybody should be using the most powerful technology ever created to reshape human society into a utopian paradise. Instead, people are using it to watch cats eat their own shit and monkeys jerk off with frogs.\\nIt’s not technology that’s ruining society; it’s how people are using it. They’re using it without aspiration, without curiosity, without the idea that it could make their lives better, that it could make them better people. And it can do those things. But it’s easier to identify with some negative element of your current condition and not only accept it but f*cking celebrate the shit out of it. People will take their worst traits and crown themselves kings and queens of that trait. F*ck reading, I’m an illiterate king. F*ck brushing my teeth, I’m a root canal queen. F*ck flushing the toilet, I’m a turd waterer king. F*ck doing my laundry, I’m a stained underwear queen.\\nAnd I get the sentiment. You want to take back some perceived control, elevate your own idea of your position in the world. But calling yourself a king is going to do about as much to improve your life as calling your studio apartment a castle. What you really want to be saying, and what you really mean, is, ‘I don’t care.’ F*ck reading, ‘I don’t care if I’m illiterate.’ F*ck brushing my teeth, ‘I don’t care if I have to get a root canal.’ F*ck going back to the office, ‘I don’t care if they fire me.’ F*ck getting another job, ‘I don’t care if I have to masturbate on a webcam to pay rent.’ F*ck having a girlfriend, ‘I don’t care if I have to pay to masturbate to a girl masturbating on a webcam.’ This does not make you an independent king; it makes you lonely!\\nNow, I want to change gears and talk about something everybody’s doing but nobody wants to admit they’re doing. I’m talking about dying. That’s right, every person listening to this right now is dying. Some of you call it getting older, some of you call it aging, some of you call it maturing, some of you call it being trapped in a loveless marriage. But no matter what you call it, from the moment you’re born, you are dying, plain and simple. And it seems like we’ve built our entire society around ignoring or explaining away that very simple, very universal fact. That’s what all religions are: just complex lies we made up when our brains got big enough to start putting two and two together.\\n“Hey, Bob. Sorry to hear about your mom.”\\n“Thanks, Gary. She was getting old.”\\n“And sorry to hear about your dad, by the way.”\\n“Thanks, Bob. He was getting old too.”\\n“Hey, wait a second. It seems like all the old people f*cking die.”\\n“Holy shit Gary! I never even thought of that. But you know what that means?”\\n“Yeah, Bob. It means we’re going to get old and f*cking die too.”\\n“Well, f*ck Gary, I don’t want to die. And therefore, I don’t want to get old.”\\n“Me neither, Bob. Not unless there’s something even better after we die.”\\n“I’m listening, Gary.”\\n“What if there was like a place where you never get old, and you never die, and you get everything you want, and you have no hardship at all of any kind. And when you die here, you go there.”\\n“Gary, I really think you’re on to something with this idea.”\\nAll the governments of the world are just bullies who believe that after 6 million years of human evolution, it’s still kill or be killed, and getting killed is dying. So, you got to kill.\\nThe first government happened when a big asshole saw a smaller member of the tribe eating an apple that he wanted. So, he walked up and said, ‘Give me a bite of that apple, or I’m going to kill you.’\\nAnd the little guy said, ‘f*ck you, buddy.’\\nSo, the big asshole killed him and took the whole goddamn apple. Now, everybody in the tribe gives the big asshole a bite of their apples so he doesn’t kill them. But, if another big asshole with his own tribe happens to cross their path, the two big assholes have to fight to the death to see who is the bigger asshole. Then, the bigger asshole takes over the dead asshole’s tribe and gets even more bites of more apples.\\nEventually, one of the big assholes figures out he doesn’t want just bites of apples anymore. He wants bites of everything. And that asshole is pretty smart. So, instead of keeping track of everything everyone has, he invents a system based on a fictional resource called money, and he forces all the members of his tribe to use it, or he kills them.\\nAnd today, that smart asshole’s invention controls every aspect of human society. There was another pretty smart asshole who figured out how to use a stick when he had to fight other assholes. And the stick worked so well, he never lost a fight until he ran into an asshole with an even bigger stick. And it’s been like that for about 5 million years.\\nToday, the biggest stick in the world cost $8,877 billion. It’s called the United States military. Could have solved the homeless crisis, the opioid crisis, and found a cure for cancer for half of that. Instead, we have a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the world 10 times over, and next year it’ll be 11 times. Because your stick can never be too big when it’s kill or be killed.\\nYes, folks, the assholes have been running shit since the dawn of abstract thought. I spent 71 years in the asshole system, and let me tell you, the assholes might change, but the system never does.\\nBut now, I’ve been on this side of things for, well, I guess it’s hard to say. Feels like I’ve been here forever. But, for the sake of argument, let’s just say about a day or so. And I can tell you, I’ve already learned one thing that I know is right: living is really dying, and dying is really living.\\nThank you all, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good night.\\nJust to remind you, that was not George Carlin. I hope you enjoyed my impersonation of George Carlin in my second hour-long comedy special called George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead. Thank you so much for listening and watching.

You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[applause]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[audience clapping]\\nI love coming to Madison. I always love being back here.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI’ve been able to have a very interesting perspective on what’s happening in America recently because I haven’t been living here. Um, I’ve actually been living in Barcelona, which is a very lovely place. Um, it’s a beach city. But it’s also a bit of a gay city. I think that’s why they have the lisp. Uh… “Barthelona.” [chuckles] It’s like, “We get it. You have something in your mouth.” Because it’s a beach city, and it’s a European beach city, a lot of the beaches there are clothing-optional. Which means you end up seeing a lot of penises. Um, and it’s never the best penises, you know? First of all, women never want to see a penis that they don’t want to see. Even the one we do want to see, a lot of times we’re like, “Can you put that away or, like, in something?” “Okay. In me? All right. Fine. ‘Cause…” “As long as the cap’s back on the pen, you know?” Having a penis out at the beach, it’s definitely not a young man’s game. This is an old man’s game. ‘Cause the unwritten rule is that you can have your penis out, but, like, it has to stay floppy. You know, and I imagine that’s just harder for younger guys ’cause there’s, like, boobs and, like, you know, a breeze. But these older guys are quite impressive. They’re there with their hands on their hips, “My penis will stay as soft as the sand I’m standing on.” A lot of them are bigger guys too. They’re a bit older, out-of-shape guys. They’ve got a bit of a belly. I don’t think they’ve seen their penis in a while. I think that’s kind of why they do it, you know, so they can see it reflected in your eyes. Like, “I still got it. Okay, good.” Of course, there’s women there, too, so there’s a lot of boobs out. Anytime I go to the beach, I don’t take off my swimsuit because I’m not trying to get that sunburned. And, uh… But I’ll go with my friend, and she takes off her top and… She recently… She got breast implants, so… and I hadn’t seen them yet, and they were, like, really… they look really good. So I was like, “Oh my gosh, your fake boobs look amazing.” And then she got mad at me ’cause I called them fake boobs. And I was like, “Well, they’re not real.” If your friend got breast implants, would you call them real?\\n[audience members] No.\\nWould you? Okay, good. So we’re all a little transphobic.\\n[audience laughs, then exclaims]\\nThat’s a fun social experiment. You know, if they’re fake on a woman… they’re fake on a woman. Anyway, what I… [chuckles] I know, you all feel like I got you, didn’t you? Well, I did. That’s why. What I’m talking about right now, though, is… I’m describing the regular beach. So in Barcelona, there’s a regular beach, and there’s a gay beach. If you’re one of those people like, “Why can’t the gay beach be the regular beach?” Go to the gay beach. You’ll be like, “That’s not regular.” And, of course, there’s also penises out at the gay beach, but the differences between the penises at the regular beach and the penises at the gay beach are like the difference between a dog parkand a dog show. Like, at the regular beach, they’re like, “We’re all just having a good time!” At the gay beach, they’re like, “Number five,” and he’s like, “Yes, yes.” Of course, you know when I say “gay beach” I mean male gay beach. It’s not a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a beach where they’re like, “Volleyball’s at 5:00. Sunscreen’s over there.” “Here’s some boots. The sand’s uneven, we’re working on it.” “We teach CPR on Mondays.” “We do have Taco Tuesdays. It does mean both things.” “You can eat, and then you can eat.” Okay, okay, so… if the regular beach is a dog park, and the gay beach is a dog show, the lesbian beach is a dog rescue. It’s like, “You’re safe here.” And also, they probably literally rescue dogs. I have developed, over the last couple years, a fascination with lesbians. Are there any lesbians here?\\n[scattered whooping]\\nHow many gay men are here?\\n[louder scattered whooping]\\nIt’s probably about the same number, but this is why I like lesbians. Gay men, you’re very loud.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nLesbians live in the shadows. Gay men… We always know when gay men are around. You guys aren’t shy at all. Even at the parade, you guys are like above the float, dancing all around. Lesbians are just underneath, making sure stuff works. They’re like, “We’re on the right route. It’s okay, yeah.” Lesbians live in the shadows. You know, lesbians are like bees. If you don’t bother them, they won’t bother you. But also, if they all die, the world ends.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd you do… Like, lesbians do… You scare me a little bit. I’m intimidated by lesbians. Uh, you’re a bit scary. Uh, I think lesbians are so scary that even AIDS was like, “Let’s stick to less terrifying things like needles and butt holes.” [chuckles] And lesbians definitely leave their mark on the world. It’s just sometimes a little more subtle. Like, lesbians wore khakis so hard that now when men wear khakis, they look like lesbians. Like, any time I see Jim Harbaugh on the sideline, I’m like, “Go get ’em, Coach Lesbian.” Like, any of you gay men who are here, were any of you, like, little gay boys?\\n[distant whooping]\\nYeah. You… You know the gay boys I’m talking about. We’ve all seen the little gay boys. Like, the kids at the park that are just like, “I don’t want to play.” He’s, like, over twerking by the slide. His dad’s trying to throw the ball with him and it’s like, “Just stop it.” “It’s not going to catch, okay?” We know little gay boys exist, which means little lesbians also exist, but you never see a little lesbian because lesbians live in the shadows. I want to see a little lesbian, you know, just a little girl, like, aggressively eating a muffin. She doesn’t know why she’s doing it. She’s like, “I got to practice.” “I got to really get in there.” And I think women, we really fucked up. We befriended gay men. I don’t think that was the right choice. I think we should’ve befriended lesbians. Lesbians would be like, “Come on, we found a way to run a successful society.” Instead, we befriended gay men, and they’re like, “Bitch, you’re ugly.”\\n[audience applauds]\\nAnd we’re like, “He’s my best friend.” “I like him ’cause he’s mean to me in a different way.” And there’s not, like… not that many prominent lesbians, you know? Even now, sometimes you’ll hear about lesbians… Like, you’ll find out they’re a lesbian after they died. Like, men will be like, “Oh, I thought she was just miserable and alone.” And it’s like, “No, she lived with that lady.” “Yeah, I know, I thought they were miserable and alone together.” ‘Cause I think it’s still hard for straight men to sometimes believe that women can be happy without a man. And I think even straight women, I think even we know that that’s possible. And now we have the luxury to decide if we want to get married or not. That used to not be the case. You used to always have to get married. I’m sure there were some women that, like, during World War II, their husband went off to fight in the war, and then he died. And they were like, “Oh no.” “No, I’m too heartbroken, I can never marry again.” “This bed is big.” [chuckles] And also, for the longest time, I think straight men, they always wanted lesbians to be, like, two hot young women who would maybe, like, invite them to join. And lesbians were like, “No, that’s not who we’re gonna be.” There was always at least one lesbian in a couple who looked like she knew how to, like, build a deck. And that made sense to me. That couple made sense to me because I knew who was doing the work. Now there is the emergence of the young, hot lesbian couple, and it doesn’t make any sense to me, because I have no idea who’s doing any work. Hot women don’t have to work. I can’t figure it out. It just seems like it’s going to be two women lying in bed waiting for something to happen to them. Like, when there’s a burglar, who’s going down? And also, who’s going down? I know the answer for gay men. It’s both of you for both those things. You’re both going down on each other, and you’re both going down to the burglar to see if he wants to come up. Like, “Oh, you brought zip ties? Good. We were already playing hostage.” But my biggest… The reason I’ve been so fascinated with lesbians, I think it actually comes from a jealousy. I’m jealous of the lesbian relationship because you get to be a wife, but you also get a wife. That seems super productive. I want to be a wife, but I don’t… I don’t get a wife. I get a husband. And what’s he going to do? What’s he gonna do in this almost equal society we fought so hard for? What? Protect me? From who? He’s the guy most likely to kill me.\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[distant whooping]\\nAnd so the fact is, you know, the reason I moved to Barcelona, as a strong independent woman, was for a boy. [chuckles] And being in love and being happy is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me. Uh… I was… Before this, I was always single and I was miserable, and it made sense, and I knew why. Now I’m happy, and I’m in love, and it’s terrifying because it could go away at any point. But I actually think this is the key to a successful relationship. Never feel secure. [chuckles] No matter how long you’ve been in a relationship, always think your partner could leave. ‘Cause then you’re never too mean. Like, I treat my guy like an indoor/outdoor cat. I’m like, “You can go, but there’s good food here.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd I’ve been learning a lot of terrible things about myself in this relationship. Like, um, I… I learned that, apparently, I’m a nurturer. Like, uh, despite any of my wishes. Uh… I like to do things for him, like cook for him and do his laundry. Which is insane, because I don’t like to do my own laundry. This is everything you need to know about why women aren’t ahead. We’re just willing to do nice stuff for other people because it makes us feel good. I didn’t want this to be my life. I didn’t know cooking and doing laundry for a man would do something like bring me joy. But it does. I love to do it. I love to take care of him. It’s really lovely. I started using fabric softener because of him. I never used fabric softener before because I thought fabric softener was a scheme. I thought it was a scheme by Big Laundry to just get us to use another liquid. And so I’ve never used it before. And one day he comes up to me… And he approached me about this like anyone does who, like, wants something to keep happening, you know. He was like, “Hey, baby, I love you so much.” “Do you ever notice our clothes are a little bit crunchy?” [chuckles] And when I hear crunchy clothes, the first thing I think of is semen, right? But I know that’s not why these clothes are crunchy, ’cause I know where all the semen is going, you know? Guys, don’t be gross. In the trash can. Which is what I call my vagina.\\n[man shouts]\\n[scattered clapping]\\nThis is a… This is just a tiny peek into a comedian’s life. I riffed that joke on stage one night, and I liked it so much that I was like, I’d rather keep calling my vagina a trash can than not do that joke. So the clothes are crunchy and it’s not ’cause of the semen, because that’s in old trash can over here. He’s like, “Ever notice our clothes are crunchy?” I was like, “Yeah, I have noticed.” And he was like, “Maybe we could start using fabric softener.” And then I went on my whole “fabric softener is a scheme” rant, and he didn’t leave, you know, so I thought that was pretty good. And so I bought fabric softener, and I started using it. And you know what happens when you put fabric softener onto the clothes that you then put on your body? It makes them softer. It’s a perfectly-named product. I should’ve been using it this whole time. Know what I blame? I blame the marketing. They’re marketing this product wrong. You got to get rid of that gay Snuggie Bear. He’s gay, right? Him and the Pillsbury Doughboy, they’re gay. They’re… They’re just out there touching tummies. You know what fabric softener needs? Know what mascot fabric softener needs? A sturdy lesbian. Just a sturdy lesbian on the cover being like, “It works, okay?” And I’m not used to a lot of the stuff that comes with relationships. He says very romantic and sweet things to me, you know. Like, he’ll say things like, “I could just look into your eyes forever.” “You have the most beautiful eyes.” Which, to be honest, made me feel okay about my body, you know? Like, “Just my eyes? Okay.” Uh… Then I do the very girly thing that we sometimes do. I’d be like, “Well, what happens when I get old and, uh…” “Like, my…” I hopefully age terribly, you know, and… “…you know, everything starts falling apart?” He’s like, “I don’t care. I could look into your eyes forever.” “They’re so beautiful. I absolutely love staring into your eyes.” Which is like a really sweet thing to say. But then I thought of one more question I wanted to ask him. But I didn’t ask it because there’s only one right answer, and I knew if he didn’t say the right answer, I’d have to leave. The question I wanted to ask was, “Okay, so what if someone plucked out my eyes… and I just had two sockets?” “Then what would you do?” I didn’t ask that question ’cause there’s only one right answer. And the right answer is, “Walk away quietly.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\n‘Cause that’s the funniest way to leave a newly blind person, is… “Are you still there?” “I feel your energy.” And it is, you know, like… Oh, I should mention, the guy I’m in a relationship with, he’s a Black man, and the only reason I’m telling you that is so you know I’m a good person. Uh… It’s really relevant for the next couple jokes. They don’t work as well if he’s not Black. Uh… There was one night I got home, and he was asleep on the couch, and the TV was on. And I don’t know what he fell asleep to, but when I came in, there was a video playing about white privilege. I was like, “This is the most passive-aggressive thing I’ve ever seen.” Like, I’m the white woman in this relationship. I’m the passive-aggressive one. How are you supposed to… How dare you try to out-white-woman me? So I did the whitest-woman thing I could think of. I called the police. And now he’s dead, so… I’m kidding, we live in Spain. They don’t do that there. They just give you an olive and make you take a nap. But, you know, it’s been really great and… Actually, not just this relationship, but everything over the past couple years, it’s really taught me we should always lead with love and kindness. No matter what. The relationship you’re in, your friends, your family, strangers, especially strangers. We should always lead with love and kindness. And of course we’re gonna argue, of course we’re gonna disagree. And hopefully those arguments never get too bad, but no matter what happens, you should always try to be the first person. Always try to be the first person to say, “Why are you yelling?” ‘Cause if you say that, you’ve won. And that’s what it’s really all about.\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\nPart 2: All Struggles Matter + Me Too\\n[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nIt’s fine, I don’t really care.\\n\\n\\n\\n[laughter]\\nI always like being here in Philadelphia.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love coming to Madison. I love being back here.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI’ve been noticing lately that a lot of comedians have been using their time on stage to talk about their struggles, and how they identify. And I think that’s good for comedy.\\n[audience laughs]\\nUm… Guys, this is serious. So… [chuckles] Guys, I’m about to talk about my struggles. I thought, you know, I could use my platform, here, to talk about how I struggle and how I identify. You remember, like, 15 years ago, this commercial would come on that would be like, “Do you have the urge to move your legs at night?” “Do you get a creepy crawly feeling in your legs?” “You might have restless leg syndrome.” Well, it turns out, I have restless leg syndrome. And you know how I got diagnosed with restless leg syndrome? I listened to those symptoms, and then I go, “Yes, I have it.” There’s no cure. And it is. You get this, like, itchy kind of feeling in your legs at night. You feel like you have to move them. Which also, I mean… Even just to have this disease… Calling it a disease is a bit of a… stretch. It’s kind of like the white women of diseases. You know, where you’re like, “Is it a problem? I don’t…” Like, even to recognize that you have it, you have to have a lot of time to rest. I was just relaxing at home for hours… when my legs were like, “Move.” It’s either restless legs, or it’s, like, prediabetes. Like… It’s your body being like, “Take a lap.” [chuckles] And it’s hard. The more you talk about it, kind of like the more, like, unbelievable it actually sounds. Like, if there was a GoFundMe for restless leg syndrome and a cat who needed a wheelchair… I think that cat’s getting a wheelchair. We don’t even know if he has restless legs ’cause he doesn’t have any.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nOh, don’t be sad about a fake cat that I just made up. And, like, this is not a great thing to complain about in the best of times, but, like, we’re not in the best of times. You know? Like, we’re just out of pandemic. People can’t find baby formula, gas is like $90 an ounce. Meanwhile, I’m like, “Sometimes at night I have to wiggle my legs because of the itchys and the scratchys.” So, I guess what I’d like to do tonight is I’d like to come out as insufferable. [chuckling]\\n[woman cheers]\\n[man] Yeah!\\nI feel validated because this Black man just raised his glass to me. And weunderstand suffering. It has… It has… It has been a really hard time for white women. I mean, not literally. [chuckles] Like, a lot of people are coming out and talking about their struggles, and white women are really trying to be a part of that. It’s been kind of hard for us to do, you know? ‘Cause it’s hard to have, like, a struggle and a skin care routine. Like, things are hard. I did this joke the other night and a white lady screamed out. She goes, “You’re going the wrong way.” She’s really having a hard time. But I thought about it and I think, white women, I think I figured out what our struggle is. I think our struggle is hearing how hard it is for other people is really hard for us. Like… Like, we heard how hard it was for Black people, and we were devastated. We saw pictures of the destruction in Ukraine, and we needed a social media break. We heard about the crimes against humanity in Palestine, and we didn’t really get into that one ’cause that’s not one of the “in” crises. But in general, hearing how hard things are for other people has been really hard for us. So hard, we can barely make our own jewelry. [chuckles] And, like, we blame a lot of stuff on white men, you know, and women, you have done a lot of stuff. [chuckles] Like, don’t even get mad about it. You’ve been really terrible, but you’re really good at it. You know? Like, white men came over from Europe, annihilated a civilization, and then rebranded it as Thanksgiving. That’s, like, pretty impressive. You know, and we blame a lot of stuff on you guys, which is very funny to me because we act like we haven’t participated in it at all. And we have participated at the most fundamental of levels. We made you. [chuckles] We’re like the guy who made the atom bomb, and we’re like, “But don’t use it!” You’d think, we’ve spent all this time with white men, you would think we would have picked up some tips and tricks by now. You know. You guys have the blueprint. It’s like we haven’t learned anything. It’s like we spent our whole life with Michael Jordan and only walked away with a bad gambling habit. I think one of the reasons it’s been hard for us to get ahead is because white women, we want to… We don’t want to give up being the victim, you know? But we also want to be in charge. We want to be the head victim in charge. You know, we want to be the manager, but we also want to be able to ask for the manager. Like, “I need to speak to the manager!” “Oh no, that’s me, and I’m a bitch.” And we’re really good at being the victim, you know, we’re good at it. Like, we’re the bride of victims. No matter what’s happening to other people, we’re like, “No, no, it’s my day.” [chuckles] “And my dad’s kind of paying for the whole thing, so…” And sometimes I get a bit frustrated with white women because… By the way, this whole section is gonna be about you, white women, if you haven’t picked that up yet. So if you’re starting, you know, starting to take offense, don’t worry, just cross your arms. “This is not what I came here for.” Sometimes I feel like we’re waiting for things to be nice for us, you know? Because I’ve said it before, you know. White women, we are oppressed. Sexism definitely exists, you know. But white men, you guys were smart. You kept us comfortable. It was a very air-conditioned oppression. Like, you know, again, I don’t want to downplay what happens to women. You know. Like, obviously sexism exists. A lot of women get murdered and assaulted, um, by like, you know… Okay. So I looked up the statistics for this. Um… For the joke, not because I cared. [chuckles] But, of the women who get murdered, 91% of them get murdered by someone they know. 62% of that is by their husband. So not are we getting murdered, we’re getting murdered by the people who we love the most. You know, and then I heard about all these trans women getting murdered and assaulted. And all I could think of when I heard that was, “Welcome.” [chuckles lightly]\\n[audience chuckles, then exclaims]\\n“Jump on in, the water is terrible.” “And full of missing women.”\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nSome people will say, “No, statistically, more trans women are getting murdered.” I’m like, are they getting murdered ’cause they’re trans or are they getting murdered ’cause they’re not used to presenting as a woman? You know, like, I can understand if they’re getting murdered, someone’s murdering them, they’re like, “This is ’cause you’re trans.” [chuckling] By the way… Sorry, I’m… I’m stabbing the person. I just looked at myself doing that. I was like, it looks like… Okay, I’m not jerking the person off. It’s a very different situation. “This is ’cause you’re trans.” “It’s a fun surprise.” You know… Technically, maybe you could murder someone that way, I don’t know. Probably take a while. [chuckles dryly] “You’re almost out.” You know what I’m saying? I… No, this is a knife, and I’m stabbing. “This… This is ’cause you’re trans.” If that’s how they’re getting murdered, okay, yes. It’s because they’re trans. Or, you know, is it because they’re not used to presenting as women and they’re doing, you know, stuff they shouldn’t be doing, like… walking home at night. Like, you used to be a lion. Now you’re a gazelle. There’s different rules, bitch. Okay? You can’t do everything you used to be able to do. You can’t just hang around vans. Like, what… what happened? Did you speak up in a meeting? Or did you do the most dangerous thing of all? Did you marry the love of your life? So, I understand. I understand when women are unhappy with society. You know, it makes sense to me. But you’re unhappy with society, do something about it. You know, all I see is these white women Karening. And that’s really frustrating to me. First of all, Karening isn’t new. Karening’s been happening since the beginning of time. You guys just finally started recording it. Like, there’s literally, like, cave paintings of Karens. It’s just a woman who’s like, “You’re not supposed to have a fire here.” Karening frustrates me ’cause it’s such an ineffective use of your power. You know, like when white men are unhappy with society, they really do something about it. They really get in there. You know, they run for office, they change laws, they gerrymander, they get their hands dirty, you know? When we’re unhappy with society, we don’t do that. We just, like, knock over a display in Target. It’s so frustrating. I think sometimes we think that, like, you know, as individuals, we can’t create change. And you can. Just you, as an individual, you can create change. I see men do it all the time. Women, you can do it on your own. You know, like, um… Ted Kaczynski wasn’t happy with society, and you know what he did? He built a perfectly symmetrical cabin, he wrote a manifesto, and sure, he sent some bombs in the mail, which wasn’t a great idea. But you know what happened to him? Netflix made three documentaries… and everyone knows Ted Kaczynski is the Unabomber. I don’t even know a Karen’s real name. Y’all are just thrown under the umbrella of Karen. I want a white woman to do something where I know your full name. Be your own Ted Kaczynski.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\n[chuckles] And look, you know, like, I don’t always just like to present problems, you know? Sometimes it’s good to have solutions too. And so I think women, white women, I think at some point in your life, you should be in a serious relationship with a Black man. All of us white women, at some point in our life, a serious relationship with a Black man. Just… Yeah. Um… Maybe this guy. Uh… He’s sitting by himself. [chuckles] I need you to be in a serious relationship with a Black man, just so you can hear how stupid all of your complaints actually sound. Like if you both get home from a hard day and you’re like, “I literally had the worst day.” And he’s like, “Yeah, I had a bad day too.” And she’s like, “Well, what happened to you?” “Well, another Black man was shot in the back by the police, and it was actually a guy from my neighborhood and he wasn’t even running away.” “He was walking away, and this stuff just keeps happening, and it’s never going to change, and I’ve lost, like, all hope, and I’m just so angry.” “But what happened to you?” [softly] Uh… -Eh… –\\n[audience laughs]\\n“No, it’s not important.” “No, baby, in this house, we share.” “What happens to you happens to me.” Um… “Well, today at work, this guy called me a girl, and I’m a woman.” I can feel some women in here be like, “Well, she is.”\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[Michelle] I make fun of white women a lot. And the only reason I do it is because it’s fun and easy. But it’s not fair. You also deserve credit for some stuff, too, you know? Like, remember a couple of summers ago when we realized that Black Lives Matter? Waiting until a couple summers ago to realize things have been hard for Black people is like needing to see that documentary to know SeaWorld is bad. Like, did you know whales shouldn’t live in a sink?\\n[scattered clapping]\\nBut you know what we did? We realized things were hard, and white women really got out there. They protested, they advocated, you know, they really tried to do the work, but then something devastating happened to a lot of us white women. A lot of us white women realized we’re the ones who’ve been racist this whole time. We were shocked. We were so shocked, we pulled our purse closer. But even after that, we were like, “Wow, we didn’t even know we were like this.” “From now on, we’re going to learn.” “We’re going to listen, we’re going to hear, we’re going to open a small Black business.” “But most importantly, from now on, we’re going to do better.” “We want to do better.” And honestly, all jokes aside, that’s all we can do as a society. We can’t change the past. All we can do is better in the future. I genuinely think that’s the path forward for us.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nExcept… that’s almost exactly what men said after Me Too, and we found that answer completely unacceptable. Men were like, “Us? The whole time? We didn’t even know.” “From now on, we want to learn and listen and hear and open a small Black business.” “But most importantly, from now on, we want to do better.” “We’re going to do better.” And we were like, “No, not good enough.” “You all have to die.” “Every one of you. Doesn’t matter what you did.” “You could have raped somebody or accidentally whispered into a boob.” “It’s all the same.” “And you have to die.” Me Too was the worst-run movement I’ve ever seen. I was so frustrated by it because I think we genuinely could have made social change. We could have made things better for women and men, but we fucked it up from the very beginning. And I tried. I tried to get involved in Me Too. I didn’t want to get Me Too’d. Not how I wanted to get involved. I thought the more fun way to get involved would be to, like, Me Too men, you know? But that didn’t really work out. That just turned into three one-night stands. It’s really hard to Me Too a guy. You ever tried to Me Too a man? It’s very hard. You go up to a guy at work, you’re like, “Hey, nice ass.” He’ll be like, “Oh my God, no one has ever complimented my body.” “Most people call me smart and capable.” “But you made me feel pretty.” “And I touch your boobs.” It’s hard, you know? Everyone has different lines, you know? I don’t even think some men know where their line is. I think some men go so far past their line, when they finally turn around and see it, they’re like, “I have to go home.” And also, men, you like gross things. You do. You know this about yourselves. You like gross things. Like, I was in Thailand, and I went to one of those Ping-Pong shows.\\n[man exclaims]\\nIf you don’t know what they are, it’s not a game of Ping-Pong. I don’t know, it’s a little… A little bit a game of Ping-Pong. It’s these shows where women put Ping-Pongs and other things in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out at quite a velocity. I mean… these things really come at you. And it’s not just Ping-Pongs. One lady smoked out of her vagina. Another lady sucked up a little goldfish and then spit that guy back out. And it was still alive. Which I thought was very impressive. That’s like a solid pH that lady’s working with.\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[woman whoops]\\nOf course, the main event, they put Ping-Pongs in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out. And I’m telling… They really come at ya. This isn’t even a joke, they give you paddles to hit them away with. And you wanna hit them away. There’s probably some guys who are like, “Oh no, I missed.” [sniffs]\\n[audience exclaims]\\nOh, if the guy you’re with “Oh’d” too loud, he’s one of them. And I don’t know if this is just ’cause I’m like a competitive person, but as soon as I saw this, I started to wonder which of those things I could do. Every woman in this room, I think we all have the ability to smoke out of our vaginas. I think… I think we can all do that. I just wouldn’t do it if you’re pregnant, you know? You don’t want your baby to think he’s, like, too cool. You know? The fish one… The fish one, I would never try. I would never try the fish one because if the fish died, I would be mortified. I’d be like, “What? Too fishy for you?” The Ping-Pong one, that’s the one you want to know about yourself. Every woman in this room is asking herself the same question right now. Say it with me. “Can I shoot Ping-Pongs out of my vagina?”\\n[cheers and applause]\\nSo I tried, and now I’m just chock-full of Ping-Pongs. If anyone wants to play a game later, just drop-kick me in the stomach. Get some of those Ping-Pongs out, and hopefully that baby.\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nYou gotta keep abortion jokes early in the set, you know? [chuckling] Before it’s a baby, so… The point is, the only reason I tell that story is because that show only exists because men, you like gross things. There’s no female version of that show. We’re not going anywhere to see men shoot anything out of their bodies. In fact, the one thing you do shoot out of your bodies, oftentimes we’re like, “Hey, can you wipe this off?” “I’m getting sticky.” That’s one of the reasons I think Me Too is confusing for men, ’cause there’s some weird gross Me Toos out there, but I think they’re all things men would have liked if it happened to them. Like if I went up to a guy at a party, and I was like, “Hey, I saw you from across the room and then I came into a bush.” I think if I said that to a guy at a party, he would be like, “Tell me more about that.” Coming into a bush at a party, that’s like a classic Harvey Weinstein, I don’t know, bit? [chuckles] He was kind of like the cornerstone of the whole Me Too movement. And rightfully so. He did a lot of terrible things. You know, and he was on trial. A lot of women testified against him. And this one woman testified, she goes, “Harvey offered me a role in exchange for sex.” “And when I said no, he goes, ‘Then you’ll never make it in Hollywood because that’s how a lot of women make it in Hollywood.'” And then, supposedly, he started naming names. He’s like, “That’s how Charlize Theron made it, Salma Hayek.” And that’s the part you never really think about. You know, for, like, all the bad Me Toos out there, there’s, like, a couple success ones.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nYeah, it makes this whole thing a lot grayer, doesn’t it? But you should not have to give a blowjob to get ahead. You should not have todo it. But you can. This is just about knowing your skill set. You know who’d be really mad to hear this information? Prostitutes. They’re like, “You got an Oscar? I got $50.” Personally, I don’t think I could ever do it, you know, just because the guys who offer it are all kind of gross, you know? They’re like the Harvey Weinsteins, the Roger Ailes. Like… I would talk about it. I’m a bit of a talker, you know. I’d be like, “Oh no, smells down here. Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.” [Michelle chuckling]\\n[scattered whooping]\\n[scattered clapping]\\nThis was a lot more complicated of a situation than we let it be. We needed to have conversations around it, and we couldn’t even have conversations. You were either Me Too or Me Against. There weren’t even levels. There should have been some levels. You know, like “Me Too.” “Me Kinda.” “Me Didn’t Know.” [chuckles] “Me Criminal.” [chuckles] And some stuff, some truly terrible stuff happened to women. And other stuff, I was like, “No, you just had a weird sex thing.” I heard one woman say this man put his penis on her forehead during sex, and she said that was a Me Too. I was like, “No you just had weird sex.” “That’s the day you found out if you like a penis on your forehead.” “And if you do, guess what. Me too.” So… “You got any ideas in there?” It’s fun, try it later. Uh… You know, ask. [chuckles softly] We needed to have conversations, you need to be able to ask questions, because everyone has a different line. You know, one woman’s line is another woman’s rope she likes to be tied up with. You’d hear a lot of women say, “Men shouldn’t use their power to have sex.” Other women would be like, “I like when men use their power to have sex.” And then men were like, “Can you tell us which one you are?” And we were like, “No,” but for different reasons. You hear some women be like, “This man, he hit on me at work, that’s harassment, it made me feel uncomfortable.” Like, “Okay, do you want no one to hit on you at work?” “No, I only want the men who I want to hit on me to hit on me at work.” “Okay. Do you want to make a list of who they are?” “No, I’m mysterious.” “Well, then buckle up, Nancy Drew, you got some uncomfortable times headed your way.” And I did… I genuinely saw men try to get better. You know? I saw men trying to listen to us and do better. Like, uh, I was in… riding in a car with a guy, and he asked to hold my hand. And I wasn’t used to that level of consent, you know? Like… I mean, I wasn’t used to rape, either. I’m more of a social-cues girl. And… But he asked to hold my hand. And I was so taken aback by it that my first reaction was, “Oh no! He must be sick or scared.” So I grabbed his hand, and I was like, “It’s going to be okay, buddy.” You know, relationships are complicated. Things between us are complicated, you know. And women, you know, we’re a little bit to blame for some of this stuff too. Like, uh, we’re attracted to the most dangerous type of man. You know, we like those big, strong guys. Tall guys with broad shoulders. You know how many times I’ve said “I want a big strong guy who can pick me up and throw me against the wall”? And then other women have definitely said, “He was big and strong, and then he threw me against the wall.” Same guy. Uh… And I say we’re partially responsible for that, because women, we’re at the point now where we decide who we marry, we decide who we mate with. We are attracted to those guys, so we marry them, we have kids with them, we make more of them. If we really wanted to make society better, we could just stop doing that. We could only marry… We could only marry short, soft-boned men. Get a whole generation of little Danny DeVitos running around. That’s actually why I think a lot of men don’t want to give women access to abortion. I think you know, deep down, that we could start deciding which of you gets to move ahead.\\n[whooping and clapping]\\n\\n\\n\\nWe could keep a whole database. We could be like, “No, no, not him. He doesn’t text back.” “Sorry, Kevin, the future’s for communicators.” We’re also, inexplicably… Women, we’re attracted to bad men. You know? Like, I don’t know why, but we’re just attracted to bad guys. Like, Charles Manson got wedding proposals in jail. Women heard what Charles Manson did, and they thought, “I’d like to be in a relationship with that man.” Even Charles Manson had to be like, “You wanna be in a relationship with me? That’s a red flag.” We’re, like, oddly attracted to serial killers. Anytime Netflix comes out with a new documentary about serial killers, we’re, like, attracted to them. It’s crazy to me, ’cause one, they’re serial killers, and two, it makes me think about how we don’t have many female serial killers. And the ones we do all kind of make sense, you know? They’re all prostitutes who killed their johns. And I can see how that could go south, you know? She’s probably like, “Where’s my Oscar?” [chuckles] But male serial killers, we know the same thing about all of you. Male serial killers all had terrible moms. But a lot of us women, we have terrible dads, and we don’t turn into serial killers. We just turn into people who have sex with other dads. It makes me so frustrated at women. I’m like, “Can you stop being a people-pleaser for five fucking minutes and get to murdering?”\\n[woman screams in laughter]\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\nYou know, be the change. You know? [chuckles]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\nPart 3: News to Me + All Beautiful\\n[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nIt’s fine, I don’t really care.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI always like being here in Philadelphia.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.\\n[cheering and clapping]\\nI love coming to Madison. I always love being back here.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThis is gonna be fun. We’re gonna have a good time.\\n[cheers and applause rise and fade out]\\nI think a lot of times, women, we always feel like we have to, like, support other women, which… I don’t think we need to do that. Um…\\n[audience laughing]\\nLike, that’s, like, a lot to ask of a whole gender, you know? We don’t ask that of men, you know? Like, men aren’t like, “Men should support other men.” That’s not… They’re just like, “We’ll invade. It’s okay.” It’s totally fine not to like other… There’s plenty of women that I don’t like, you know? But sometimes I’ll find out information about them that will at least, like, let me understand them. Like, I saw an article about Nancy Reagan. First of all, I’ve never been a fan of Nancy Reagan. I always thought she was a tiny little cunt. You know? Yeah. That’s just my opinion. I don’t know. It’s not… But I saw an article about her recently that made me at least understand her. Uh, the article talked about how in Hollywood in the ’70s, Nancy Reagan was known as the throat GOAT. Yeah. Little old Nancy Reagan, in Hollywood in the ’70s, was known for the best at giving blow jobs. Do you know how hard it is to be the best at giving blow jobs in Hollywood in the ’70s? That’s how people auditioned. And she was the best. She was the Michael Jordan of blow jobs. Little old Nancy Reagan. But then, after I read that, her whole life made sense to me. It’s like, of course she hated gay men. They were her competition. She’s like, “We gotta keep AIDS around, my cheeks are getting tired.” [Michelle chuckles] You know, I saw that news story… I actually read that news story like I feel like a lot of us read news these days. Which is, I saw it, and I wanted to believe it was true, so then I just did. You know, like, I didn’t check sources or anything. Now that I’m thinking about it, I really wanna know what the sources are. It’s like a bunch of older men who are like… [mumbles] You know? You know she’s really good if that was the one thing Ronald Reagan remembered. “When Nancy puts me in her mouth…” “Hey, this is a Cabinet meeting, okay?” “Someone get him more jelly beans. We need…” [Michelle chuckles] But I think that’s what a lot of us do now when we look at the news, you know? We see something that kind of fits in line with what we want to believe, and then because we feel it’s true, it is. And that’s an incredibly dangerous place to be as a society. Plus, once something’s out there about you, it doesn’t actually matter if it’s true or not, people will just believe it. There’s some things out there about me that aren’t true, but I’m sure people believe it. Like, after I did the Correspondents’ Dinner, I got a lot of trolling. And, to be honest, most trolling, very boring. You know, it’s just repetitive. You know, a lot of it’s like, “You bitch, you cunt, you Carrot Top-looking motherfucker.” And that’s just me in the mirror, so… Well, how do you come? I got one really good troll after the Correspondents’ Dinner. I appreciated this troll. It was creative. He put in time and effort. It was really good. What he did was he took what looked like a screenshot of my actual hometown newspaper, the Hershey Chronicle, and so… I mean, the font was correct. A lot of information in the article was right. Like where I went to school, when I graduated, what I majored in. The meat of the article was incorrect. The headline read, “Wolf pleads guilty to bestiality.” Out of the box, though, right? You know? And I tried to find this article again, and I just, I Googled “Wolf bestiality.” I think I got a bit egotistical where I was just like… I was like, “Oh, wait, I need more words than that.” But that’s a fun rabbit hole if you want to go down that one. But the title of this article said, “Wolf pleads guilty to bestiality.” So now I find myself in the odd position to have to say things like, “No, I’ve never had sex with a dog.” But as soon as you have to say you’ve never had sex with a dog, it sounds like maybe you’ve had sex with a dog. By the way, that was the bestiality they were referring to. They said my bestiality was dog sex. If, when I said bestiality, you pictured a different animal, guess what, that’s the animal you would have sex with. And now you know that about yourself, so… That’s fun and exciting, you know? This article, now, all of a sudden, it makes me think of things that I never even wanted to think about before, like, “How do I have sex with a dog?? I’m a woman. How am I fucking a dog? So then I’d think about how I’d have sex with a dog. And I think the answer is you put peanut butter on your pussy. And now it sounds like I’ve maybe fucked a dog. By the way, if you ever do want to have sex with a dog, it said after I pleaded guilty that I only got 12 months probation and $1,100 fine. So, if that’s your thing, you might want to head over to Pennsylvania. It doesn’t sound like it’s gonna put you in that deep of a hole, you know? But we’re in Wisconsin. Maybe check the laws here. They might be better. [chuckles]\\n[audience exclaims]\\nThere’s a lot of farmland. There’s a lot of farmland. People get lonely. I get it. But, yeah, I’ve never had sex with a dog. But if I was going to, I’m not having sex with a rescue. [chuckles] I’m having sex with a purebred dog. A big, silky-coated dog. A dog who could really take care of me. And honestly, that would be fine if that was the only information out there about me. Um, it’s not. Do you guys remember Jeffrey Epstein, like, of the pedophiles? So, at some point, someone put a list of all the people who apparently went to Epstein’s island out. And it’s, like, a pretty good list. It’s got Barack Obama, Beyoncé, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks. Also on the list, me. Well, that’s not good. Now it looks like I fuck kids and dogs. It looks like I’m really going out of my way not to have sex with men. Which, if I was interested in both kids and dogs, a perfect combination of that is men.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd now I find myself in a position no one ever wants to be in, which is having to say the phrase, “No, I’ve never had sex with a kid.” I’ve never even been to that island. But by the way, if all those people are going, I’m gonna go. You probably don’t have to do anything there. You can probably just get a cocktail and see what Meryl Streep’s into. Which hopefully is role-play. You know? She’s a really good actress. I don’t know. So, I know, I had to say things like “I’ve never had sex with a kid.” And I haven’t. But if I was going to have sex with a kid, I wouldn’t go to some billionaire’s island to do it. I’d do it the normal way and become a teacher.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nI know, we should pay them more. Get them supplies.\\n[upbeat music playing]\\nI hear all the time, women talk about how we should all be beautiful, how we should all feel beautiful. So it’s like, “We’re all beautiful.” “We’re all beautiful.” Well, first of all, that means we’re still valuing women on beauty. We’re like, “You have to be beautiful to be important, so we’ll just make sure every woman feels beautiful.” Which is maybe not the right metric. Also, a little problem with that plan, we’re not all beautiful. [chuckles] The only reason you know someone’s beautiful is ’cause you’ve seen someone who’s not. You’re like, “Yeah, that’s different… than that.” Like, recently, I was at the same event as Naomi Campbell, and people kept wanting us to take a picture together, and I was like, “No!” “I’m not gonna document how different humans can be.” “My skill set doesn’t come across in a photograph.”\\n[scattered clapping]\\n[scattered whooping and clapping]\\nNot too much, okay, guys. [chuckles] Also, but how dare you? How dare you want every woman to be beautiful? Don’t you think there’s women out there who knew they were ugly? They knew they were ugly, so they got good at something. They got respected for their abilities.\\n[cheering and applauding]\\nAnd then… And then some little bitch comes up to her, and she’s like, “You’re beautiful.” It’s like, “No, shut up.” “I got a horse face, and I’m an electrical engineer.” We gotta stop. We gotta stop with all this beautiful nonsense. We should even stop telling little girls they’re beautiful. I think as soon as they can understand us, you look that little girl right in the eye, and you go, “With a face like that, you get good at math.”\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\n“We’re all beautiful.” So much… So much of our existence is based off of beauty, and it’s such a waste of time. Like, Victoria’s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model. Don’t worry, this isn’t gonna be a joke about Down syndrome. You don’t have to draw a real hard line in the sand. Victoria’s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model and everyone was like, “This is such a great accomplishment for women.” And, don’t get me wrong, I’m glad that lady has a job. But, uh, can we stop acting like women posing with no clothes, or almost no clothes, is an accomplishment? It’s literally the least you could do. This is how little of an accomplishment it is. I couldn’t think of something it was like. I kept thinking, like, I don’t know, a baby learning how to use a spoon, and I was like, I don’t know, it’s still an accomplishment. It is literal… It’s the least you can do. There’s nothing impressive about it. It’s not moving the needle forward for women at all. We seem to have this idea that if every woman can pose nude, finally, we’ll get ahead. It’s not… It’s not doing anything for us, you know? It’s like, “We want equality,” and then someone was like, “How about every type of woman can be in a Dove commercial?” And we were like, “We’ll take it.” They were like, “Really? “This feels like a whole ‘beads for New York’ situation.” ‘Cause we’ve seen it. We’ve seen every type of woman. Every age, weight, race, number of arms, we’ve seen it all. There’s nothing impressive about it. You know? And we were the ones, women… We were the ones who needed to see it. You know, we saw what the standard model was, and we said, “I want that.” Men didn’t do this. Men didn’t put these ideas in our heads. Men saw every woman, and they’re like, “I’ll take that one.” “Yeah, that’s neat too. Okay.” “Line ’em up.” That’s what it feels like. It feels like we’re trying to get verification that a man will jerk off to anything. That’s how low the bar is for men. It’s like, “Oh, Chad, he’ll beat it to almost anything.” We’re like, “He’s an ally.” Also, like, women, you should want to be a little bit ugly. I promise, it’ll help you out. I get called ugly all the time. I don’t care, I have a skill. I don’t care. Also, I hope I age terribly. ‘Cause the uglier I get, the better this all works.\\n[audience applauding]\\nThe uglier I get, the more people I can make fun of. Like, I can’t do any accents or impressions. Okay? There’s one accent I can do, and it’s a very offensive Asian accent. Don’t ask me how I know, okay? I wanna get so ugly that I can do that accent and even Asian people will be like, “It’s okay.” And also, women, if you’re a little bit ugly, men are gonna be much more likely to believe you’re capable. And women too, by the way. Women are much… They’re also gonna believe you’re more capable if you’re a little bit ugly. If you have a bit of a busted face… and you’re like, “I’m a mathematician,” people will be like, “That tracks. Yeah.” Oh, don’t get sad about it, it’s true. You are the problem. [chuckles] “That’s sad, she thinks she’s ugly?” Who cares? She’s got a fucking job. Oh, this lady is so drunk, it doesn’t matter. Look at some of our most successful women. We don’t really think about these women because we never equate women’s success with, like, not being beautiful. But some of our most successful women, very ugly people. Some of these references are a little old. They’re just my personal favorites. Janet Reno.\\n[woman cheers]\\n[man] Reno!\\nJanet Reno was the first female attorney general. One of the longest-ever serving attorney generals. Worked for Democrats, Republicans, this lady was great at attorney general-ing.\\n[light clapping]\\nIf you can’t remember what Janet Reno looks like, she looked like what Larry Bird looks like now. For context, Will Ferrell played her on Saturday Night Live. And his costume was, like, a little bit of lipstick. Not a pretty lady. Everyone trusted her. [Michelle chuckles] Everyone’s favorite, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nYeah. Ugly little old bird. She actually looks like a bird’s foot. All, like, wrinkly and bony, and, like, a little bit… You know. Great Supreme Court Justice. Not a pretty lady. No one’s slinging dicks at Ruth. It’s just such… It’s such a waste of time. It’s a waste of all of our times and our talents. Then for a while, there was this group of women. They were the “I don’t care” women. And, honestly, that’s like the right lane to be in. But these women were pretending they didn’t care. They actually cared because they posted about how much they didn’t care on social media. They’re like, “I don’t care what you think, I’m confident.” “I don’t care, I’m confident.” Feels like you’re trying to “Beetlejuice” confidence. But these “I don’t care” women, they don’t wear makeup, work out, do their hair, they don’t care. If that’s what you want to do, that’s totally fine. But what are you doing? ‘Cause I know how much time all of that takes me. So, if you’re not doing that, what are you doing? Are you attorney general? Are you fluent in all the languages? How are you spending all of this extra time? Like, men have never really cared about how they’ve looked. But they have almost everything to show for it. They invented almost everything. They’re like, “So sorry I look like this, but here’s electricity.” “No, wait till it gets dark. This is gonna blow your mind.” “You’re gonna be able to stare in the mirror longer.” And the worst part is, these “I don’t care” women, they were getting grouped in with powerful women. Like, “Look at these ‘I don’t care’ women.” “Look at them, they’re such great examples.” No, you’re not a powerful woman, you’re a mediocre man. And if that’s what you want to be, that’s fine. Having openly mediocre women, I think that’s a big step forward. I think that’s really good for women. If you want to be mediocre, you do it. You lean into it. Have fun. Wear elastic. But know you’re mediocre. You know, don’t you go blaming stuff on sexism. If you don’t get a promotion, don’t be like, “That’s sexist.” It’s like, “No, you don’t know Excel.” It’s an intuitive program. But that’s the kind… That’s the kind of equality I want for women. I want true equality for women. I want women to be just as good as men, just as mediocre, and just as shitty. You know? I want us to be in charge of stuff. I’d love to see us leave our kids.\\n[scattered clapping and whooping]\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I’d like to see a few serial killers. Good ones too. Like, good, creepy, dead-eyed, wear-your-skin serial killers.\\n[woman whooping]\\nThe kind Netflix makes a documentary about, and afterwards, people are like, “She’s cute, though.” [chuckles]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n♪ If you want it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n♪ If you need it ♪\\n♪ I’ve got it ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMichelle Wolf, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

People get worked up.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the news, “Gender neutral bathrooms. Should be a man and a woman.”\\n“I don’t wanna shit next to trans person.”\\nWhoa, dude. I don’t wanna shit next to anybody, okay?\\nI’ve never thought about the type of person I’m shitting next to.\\nWho’s got time to decipher someone’s background when you gotta take a dump?\\nIf I get diarrhea at a restaurant, I run to the bathroom.\\nI’m not like, “Oh no, a Puerto Rican.”\\n“Agh!”\\n“I can’t take a BM next to a PR. What the hell?”\\nI agree there should be two bathrooms, not divided by gender.\\nI think you should divide it by pissing and shitting. Hmm.\\nI don’t care who I’m shitting next to as long as they’re also shitting, right?\\nBut if I walk into the shit room and see a trans person piss, I’m gonna go, “Hey, you’d better transition to a shit right now.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“You’re in the wrong room, sister.”\\n“Brother. Whatever.”\\nBut there’s a big debate these days.\\n“Are biological women the same as trans women?”\\n“Are the different? The same? Boopity boop.”\\nI think it’s like Coke and Pepsi.\\nAlways that one guy, “I love Coke, but I hate Pepsi.”\\n“All I got’s Pepsi.”\\n“I hate that shit.”\\nHand him a Pepsi, “Here’s a Coke.” He goes, “This is pretty good.”\\nI’m like, “Well, you just fucked a trans person.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[WHOOPING, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah, it’s all fluid, right?\\nThere’ll always be that guy who goes, “Some people have no gender.”\\nYeah, that’s Coke Zero. [CHUCKLES]\\nBut what the hell do I know?\\nI grew up in the ’90s. It was like, “I don’t see color.”\\n“We’re all the same. Treat everybody equally.”\\nNow, we’re obsessed with everyone’s differences.\\nYou flip through HBO Max, it’s all these categories.\\n“Trans Stories.”\\n“Strong Black Women.”\\n“Asian Culture.”\\nI know you’re trying to be progressive, but porn’s been doing this shit for 30 years.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou’re never gonna out-inclusive porn.\\nAll these networks patting themselves on the back.\\n“We have a gay section.”\\nPorn’s like, “We have a gay, senior citizen, dwarf in a wheelchair section.”\\n“You’re not more open-minded than us, right?”\\nTalk about representation.\\nI’ve been watching Asian culture since high school.\\nHBO’s like, “We have a family section.”\\nPorn’s like, “We got that and stepfamily.

I’ll go down on you.\\nBut, you know…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nLadies, you look great. Beautiful.\\nDefinitely the better-looking gender, I think we all agree.\\nLike, ladies, you guys are even sexy on accident.\\nYou see a woman bend over or see down her shirt for a second.\\nYou’re like, “Whoa!” That’s a great moment.\\nYou see a guy in short shorts, something pops out.\\nYou’re like, “Oh, call the police.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah, the female form, it’s a work of art.\\nLadies, you look better the more skin you’re showing.\\nBikini, lingerie, mini skirt.\\nMen look better the more covered up we are.\\nBusiness suit, tuxedo, man in uniform.\\nI think a female strip club should be a guy coming out naked and slowly putting clothing on, you know?\\nSome lady’s like, “Whoo! Put on that blazer! Yeah!”\\nBy the end, she’s like, “Oh damn, he’s an astronaut.” [SIGHS]\\nLadies, you’re so hot, you touch your own body in bed.\\nYou’re on top like, “Oh yeah.”\\nNo guy wants to touch himself. No guy’s like, “All right, look at that.”\\nNo.\\n‘Cause I think you’re more turned on by men’s skills than our actual looks.\\nMen, we’re all visual.\\nWe go to a strip club, “Yeah, dance on that pole.”\\nAt a female strip club, it’s more like, “Yeah, install that pole.” Hey?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd you’re so mysterious. We have no idea what turns you on.\\nYou know everything that turns us on. We don’t know what you like.\\nI asked my wife, “What turns you on?” She goes, “I like a man who listens.”\\nI don’t know. I tuned out. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nEvery woman’s different. I asked a friend, “What turns you on?”\\nShe goes, “I like a man with intelligence.”\\nHow does that work in the bedroom? Some guy’s like, “Ah, hypotenuse.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI’m not a big strip club guy. I’m too awkward. I’m not cool.\\nSome guys are good at strip clubs.\\nGetting a lap dance, they’re like, “Yeah, bitch.”\\nOr whatever. I don’t know.\\nI’m too awkward.\\nI was in the back room once, getting a dance.\\nLady’s grinding me. She’s like, “What do you do?”\\nI’m like, “I’m a comedian.” She goes, “Tell me a joke.”\\nI was like, “Look, I’m not at work. You are.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nShe didn’t like that joke.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah.\\n[APPLAUSE CONTINUES]\\nBut hey, I’m doing all right.\\nI had sex with my wife today. Or, as she calls it, microdosing.\\nAnd, uh…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI remember when we got engaged.\\nShe was like, “You gotta post about the engagement.”\\nI was like, “Why? This is between us. Who cares about social media?”\\nShe’s like, “I want people to know.”\\n“Well, I want you to post about that threesome we had.”\\nShe’s like, “Why would I do that?” I’m like, “I want people to know.”\\nShe’s like, “Are you kidding? This is a bond between two people.”\\nI’m like, “This is better, it’s a bond between three.”\\nShe’s like, “I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a kid.”\\nI was like, “Ah…”\\nA lot of girls dream about a wedding. A lot of boys dream about a threesome.\\nAnd the dream is very similar.\\nWho we’ll invite, where we’ll do it, and we gotta get a photographer.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nShe’s a great egg, but I can always find a new way to piss her off.\\nTouched her stomach the other day, she flipped out.\\nShe’s got a nice stomach, just self-conscious about it.\\nPeople talk about private parts, like boobs are a private part.\\nI walk in a room, grab my girl’s boobs, she’s like, “Hey, how are ya?”\\nI grab her stomach, she’s like, “You wanna fucking die today?”\\nThat’s a private part, right?\\nIn the bedroom, she’ll cover it up so I can’t see it.\\nWhich I get, ’cause I feel the same way about my butt hole.\\nI don’t want anybody seeing that thing.\\nEven after wild sex, I still have to walk out of the room backwards.\\nThe stomach for a woman is the butt hole for a man.\\nThe condition of both is very dependent on diet.\\n[LAUGHTER, WHOOPING]\\nShe’ll be like, “I can’t hook up, I had a burrito.”\\nI’m like, “Same here.”\\nBut, like any couple, we fight. We got into it last week.\\nShe’s like, “I’m gonna level with you. I need more compliments.”\\nI was like, “Oh shit.” So I took her to a construction site. Oh.\\nBut it gets confusing.\\nWe were walking around and a homeless guy catcalled her.\\n“Nice ass, baby!”\\nI was like, “There you go, huh?”\\nShe’s like, “What are you gonna do about that guy?”\\n“I’m gonna go over and give that guy a couple of bucks.”\\nShe’s like, “I don’t want a compliment from him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m like, “A compliment’s a compliment.”\\nShe’s like, “I’ll take you to a gay bar, see how you like it.”\\nWe go to a gay bar, guys are all over me.\\n“What do you think about that?” I was like, “I fucking love it.” So…\\nSo that backfired, you know?\\nThe new fight is, I bought a vintage car. She hates this car.\\nShe goes, “I think you like the car more than you like me.”\\nIt’s not that I like it more, it’s just easier to understand.\\nLet’s be honest, ladies. You can be vague and secretive.\\nCar’s pretty cut and dry.\\nOut of gas? Empty. Overheated? Hot. There’s no game for the car.\\nThe engine of a car has never caught on fire and the dashboard says, “I’m fine.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nHmm.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah. I don’t know.\\n[WHISTLING]\\nMen compare women to cars all the time. Ladies, you’re the opposite of a car.\\nYour car is quiet, it’s running great. Girlfriend’s quiet, you’re in deep shit.\\nGirlfriends and cars have nothing in common.\\nExcept for the fact that my last one was stolen by a Black guy.\\n[GROANS]\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI think men are more like cars.\\nWe’re gassy, we’re fixer-uppers. We kill people sometimes, right?\\nAnd, ladies, if we stop working, you can just go electric.\\n[IMITATES BUZZING]\\nI think men are more like cars. Ladies, you’re more like horses.\\nBeautiful creatures, long legs, ponytail.\\nExpensive to feed, always need new shoes, we slap you on the ass, and once we see you take a shit, the magic’s over. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut we got some couples here tonight, huh?\\nThere you go. You guys swing?\\nNo. Um…\\nYou can tell you’re close with your lady when she starts farting around you.\\nI think that’s the true test.\\nAnd I get it, ladies. It’s a biological function.\\nBut can we keep it under ten a day? What do you think?\\nYou don’t want that to become your thing.\\nYou’re at a party. “Who ripped one?” “Classic Claire.”\\n[CHUCKLES] “Every time.”\\nFarting for a woman’s a tough look.\\nFarting for a woman is like crying for a man.\\nWe all pretend to be open-minded, but that shit’s a bummer, you know?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThe other day, I was going down on her. She farted, I started crying.\\nShe was like, “Aw, you need a tissue?”\\nI was like, “Do you?”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat about fart’s wacky cousin, queef?\\nYes.\\n[CHEERING]\\nLove a good queef.\\n[WHOOPING]\\nA lot of ladies get self-conscious, embarrassed.\\nI say queef it up, sister. It’s nice to see that thing talking for once.\\nLove a queef. Big fan of the queef.\\nI went down on a girl once, she queefed, my hair went… [EXHALES]\\nIt’s a hell of a time. You know what a queef’s like?\\nIt’s like when the subway goes by and you get that dirty air, you know?\\nSure, it’s not the most sanitary, but it’s hot down there, it’s refreshing, goddammit!\\nI’m pro-queef.\\nBut you gotta be empathetic to the queefs, fellas.\\nLadies, you’re more empathetic, more thoughtful.\\nYou think about others. Men don’t think about others.\\nWe think about ourselves, you know?\\nI go to dinner with my girl, she says, “Can’t eat here, the chef’s homophobic.”\\nI’m like, “Great, we’re not gay. We’re good.” Yeah?\\nThat’s how I think. Men don’t think about others.\\nI was watching tennis with my buddy. I go, “You know this guy hit his wife?”\\nMy friend goes, “Yeah, he’s got a great backhand.”\\nJesus Christ.\\nYou’re deeper, ladies. More emotionally intelligent.\\nAsk a woman what she likes in a guy, she’ll tell you what she likes because of how it makes her feel. “I like guys who are strong. I feel safe.”\\n“I like guys with money. I feel taken care of.”\\nGuys tell you what we like, not how we feel.\\n“What do you like in a woman?”\\n“A fat ass.”\\n“Hmm. How’s that make you feel?”\\n“Hard? I don’t know.”\\nGotta be tough to be a lady in a lot of ways.\\nSome perks, ladies, you know.\\nLike, you’re allowed to announce your standards in public.\\nWhen men announce their standards, we look shittier.\\nI was hanging out with some friends. We’re drinking. Talking about our type.\\nMy gay friend was like, “I like muscles on a man.”\\nAll right, gay guy, muscles.\\nMy lady friend, “I like a tall guy.” Yeah, women like tall guys.\\n“What do you like, Mark?” “Skinny girls with big tits.”\\nThey all went, “Oh, what a fucking asshole.”\\n“How come you’re allowed to shame me for what I’m attracted to?”\\n“You guys were shallow. Why can’t I be?”\\n“You like tall guys. I’m not a tall guy. I wasn’t like, ‘Classic whore.'”\\nI’d rather be taller but that’s my issue.\\nShe’s like, “It’s messed up you won’t sleep with certain women.”\\n“What about the gay guy? He won’t fuck any women. Yell at him.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou wanna be a good guy, it just gets confusing.\\nLadies, where are we at on objectifying women? Is that bad?\\nIt’s tough. Some women say, “Don’t ever objectify a woman.”\\nBut ladies, you do it all day long.\\nAny time a woman posts on Instagram, every girl’s like, “Beautiful.” “Stunning.” “Sexy.”\\nNever seen a woman write, “Smart.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHuh. Interesting.\\nLadies, you don’t like when men objectify women if they’re hot. But if they’re traditionally unattractive, you love it.\\nSmoking hot girl walks in. “Damn, she’s sexy as hell.”\\n“Easy, creep.”\\nIf a lady rolls in on a scooter with an eye patch, “Damn, she’s sexy as hell.”\\n“This is a great guy right here.”\\nIsn’t he still a creep? If you’re not threatened, you’re on board.\\nA guy puts up a poster in his cubicle, big breasted swimsuit models,\\n“Jeez, you pig.” “Oh no, they’re trans.”\\n“Hey, good for you.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut isn’t he still a pig?\\n“Is that a Victoria’s Secret poster?” “Yeah, it’s the one with Down’s syndrome.”\\n“Oh, carry on. Carry on.”\\n[GROANING]\\nLike, why does that make it okay?\\nHow about that, a Victoria’s Secret model with Down’s syndrome. That’s exciting.\\nYeah, she’s really pretty. I mean, I’d go downs on her.\\nYou know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGood for her. I support. I’m on board. I’m a fan.\\nI feel bad for the girl who didn’t get the job.\\n“Who got it?” “You don’t wanna know.”\\n“Kill yourself. Get out of town. Change career. Don’t tell anybody.”\\nBut I also understand, ladies.\\nYou’ve been held down by your looks for generations. That sucks.\\nMy brother’s got a cute little daughter. My mom got her a Barbie.\\nThe wife’s like, “No daughter of mine is playing with Barbie.”\\n“Why not?” “Barbie sets unrealistic body standards for girls.”\\nOf course Barbie’s unrealistic. That’s why kids like her.\\nNobody wants a realistic toy.\\nLike every man toy. Twelve-pack, huge arms, giant legs. They’re toys.\\n“She’s gonna think she has to look like her.” No, she’s not.\\nI’ve never heard of a girl with a Barbie, “Damn, guess I gotta cut off my nipples.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGirls aren’t stupid.\\nI get it. It’s a new day. Gotta be inclusive.\\nGotta have plus-size Barbie, Chinese Barbie, blind Barbie.\\nYou know who’s never changed? Ken. Huh.\\nKen’s a good-looking guy, full head of hair.\\nThere’s no bald Ken, drunk Ken, abusive Ken.\\nNobody wants a realistic Ken.\\nHe pulls up in the Dream Car, gets a DUI.\\nBarbie’s like, “I told you so.”\\nHe’s like, “Shut up, you fucking skank. I’ll kill you”\\nNobody wants that.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nYeah.\\n[CHEERING, WHISTLING]\\nIf you ask me, Ken is quietly the most inclusive, ’cause he’ll fuck any Barbie. He doesn’t give a shit.\\n“What is that? Wheelchair Barbie? Yeah, roll her over here, I don’t care.”\\nNow, that’s inclusive.\\nI would’ve killed for a Barbie growing up.\\nMy parents wouldn’t buy us any cool toys. They bought us board games. [GROANS]\\nEven the names of board games are a bummer.\\nSorry. Right?\\nTrouble. Operation.\\nAnd the saddest of all, Life.\\n[GROANS]\\nWhat kind of twisted, messed up game for a kid is Life?\\nLife’s hard, life sucks.\\nYou play games to escape life, not dive right in.\\nYou got a kid outdoors, playing with his friends.\\nYou drag him inside to play a game about mortgage and divorce?\\n[GROANS] That’s too real.\\n“Pick a card, Timmy. What’d you get?” “I got herpes.”\\n“It says you sent a tweet ten years ago that came back to haunt you.”\\n“You’re fired.”\\n“Man, life sucks.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHate a board game. Remember Clue? I hated Clue.\\nProfessor Plum in the study with the candlestick.\\nThat’s not relatable. Who’s dying from a candlestick?\\nYou gotta update that stuff. Make it stuff that kills people now.\\nPeanuts.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nGender reveal party.\\nFentanyl. Cops.\\nUpdate it. Mark Normand in the hotel room under the BBW.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThat’s how I wanna go.\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah.\\nI did mention Fentanyl. We have an opioid crisis.\\n[MAN WHOOPS]\\nNobody seems to give a shit.\\nThat guy’s hopped up. Yeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah.\\nYeah. When I was a kid, all I heard was weed was the gateway drug.\\nRemember? “Weed is the gateway drug.”\\nI disagree. I think it’s cereal.\\nAll that sugar? Cereal’s getting kids high way younger than weed.\\nKids look like addicts when they wake up.\\n“Damn, I need a bowl.”\\nI mean, diabetes, obesity. We pump that shit into kids early.\\nThat’s why half the cereals are named after drugs.\\nSmacks. Right?\\nSpecial K. You know?\\nGolden Grahams. Already dealing in grams. I don’t know.\\nIf you go down the cereal aisle in Australia or Europe, it’s all health food. Heart healthy. Wholegrain. Fiber.\\nThe cereal aisle in America is like a fucking acid trip, right?\\nIt’s just bright colors and wacky cartoon characters.\\nEvery cereal mascot looks like a cracked-out addict, you know?\\nYou got a paranoid leprechaun and a jacked-up rabbit stealing shit from kids.\\nTony the Tiger’s clearly coked-up.\\n[STRAINED] “They’re great, yeah!”\\nHow about that wide-eyed toucan? “Hey, kids. Follow your nose.”\\n[CHUCKLES]\\nYeah.\\nI know fentanyl and opioid and all that stuff’s dark.\\nI like dark humor. Some people get upset. Everybody’s entitled to their opinion.\\nTo each his anal.\\nBut, you know. You’ve gotta admit, though, if we’re a society that gets upset about jokes, that’s a sign we got it pretty goddamn good, you know.\\nGuy in Ukraine’s getting his face shot. We got people here like, “Zingers, ugh.”\\nAlways blows my mind when somebody gets really upset about comedy.\\nI told a joke, this guy got pissed. He goes, “Apologize for that joke.”\\nI’m like, “Sorry?” He goes, “You didn’t mean that.”\\nI’m like, “I didn’t mean the joke either, you queef.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“What are we doing here?”\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nBut, you know, maybe it’s me.\\nMaybe it’s me. I’m too literal. Literal guy.\\nDefinitely hurt me in some social interactions, you know.\\nJust last week, I was at a party. Girl comes up to me.\\nShe goes, “Are you gay?” “Nah, I’m not gay.”\\nShe goes, “Whoa. Nothing wrong with being gay”\\nI’m like, “I know. Just saying I’m not.”\\n“You’re getting defensive.” “Well, I’m not gay.”\\n“There’s nothing wrong with it.” “I know, but I’m not.”\\nShe wouldn’t let it go. I got annoyed. I go, “Are you pregnant?”\\n“Screw you. I’m not pregnant.” “Nothing wrong with being pregnant.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut we made up eventually.\\nWe’re cool now, you know.\\nShe was like, “I should be honest.”\\n“I was pregnant for about three months in college.”\\nI was like, “Oh, that’s when I was gay.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut, you know, I’m an idiot.\\nBad socially.\\nI had a Tinder date ten years ago. Great date.\\nOne of those magical nights, everything clicked.\\nWent back to her place. Fooling around, naked, giggling.\\nShe goes, “Your Tinder pic, you look like a serial killer.”\\nI was like, “Damn, that’s not good.” Took the wind out of my sails.\\nShe goes, “What did you think of my pic?” “I thought you looked easy.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThat’s what she did. She flipped out. She went nuts.\\n“Why are you mad? Nothing wrong with being easy.”\\n“Serial killer? Way worse.” Right?\\n“You said I look like I murder people. I said you look fun.”\\n“Why are you mad? I should be mad at you.”\\nI didn’t get it. Then I realized, I’m not a serial killer.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nShe is easy.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nThat’s when I realized you can’t say what someone is to them.\\nThat’s mean. I learned that that night. You can’t say what someone is to them.\\nI’d never call a retarded person retarded. That’s just mean.\\nI’d call my friend retarded, ’cause he’s not retarded.\\nIf a friend spilled Pepsi on my laptop. “What are you doing, you retard?”\\nIf a retarded kid spilled Pepsi on my laptop, I’d be like, “Bubbles. Yay.”\\n‘Cause I’m not an asshole. I’m learning.\\n“By the way, I went on a date with a girl that looks easy.”\\n“You went on a date with a guy that looks like a killer.”\\n“What, are you fucking retarded?”\\n[LAUGHTER, CHEERING]\\nHmm.\\n[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]\\nBut I didn’t mean to insult the lady, you know.\\n“You got a problem with easy women?” “I’m here. What are you talking about?”\\nI think it’s crazy.\\nIt’s 2023. We still make women feel bad for being promiscuous.\\nSluts are the best, right?\\nWhy make them feel bad?\\nThe best time to be a promiscuous woman was Native American times.\\nInca, Aztec, Mayan.\\nThey used to sacrifice virgins to the gods. Throw them in a volcano.\\nHoly shit. I’d be the biggest tramp on the reservation.\\nIt could save your life.\\nChief walks up. “Ma’am, crops are dying. We gotta sacrifice a virgin.”\\n“Are you a virgin?” “No, huge whore.”\\n“Huge whore.”\\n“You are way off, baby. Way off, all right?”\\n“I give the best arrowhead on this side of the wigwam, okay?”\\n“You don’t know what you’re dealing with. I put the ‘ho’ in Navajo out here, okay?”\\nYeah, you know my tribe name, Spread Eagle? That’s me.\\nYeah.\\nI think I like that system better.\\nReward the fun gals, get rid of the boring ones.\\nYou know there was some chief up on the volcano going, “You should’ve fucked me.”\\n“Whoa. Hey. All right. Shit. Look at that.”\\nNothing wrong with being promiscuous.\\nDon’t let anybody make you feel bad about that.\\nBut, ladies, you gotta own being sluts. Sometimes you slut-shame yourselves.\\nThat’s not gonna help the movement, huh?\\nYou have sex with a girl. You’re like, “I gotta go.”\\n“You’re gonna leave? I feel like a whore.”\\nIt’s like, “Yeah, you are.”\\n“And that’s okay.”\\n“I don’t want you to think I’m a slut.” “No, I knew.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThere’s nothing wrong with it, remember?\\nYou can’t tell people not to slut-shame and do it to yourself.\\nIt kills me when I see women trashing promiscuous women.\\n“How about Rachel? What a whore.” “What do you mean?”\\n“She fucks a new guy every weekend.” “So what? What do you do?”\\nEvery girl goes, “I get dinner and drinks out of him. Spend some money first.”\\n“Wait, you’re calling her a whore and you’re a prostitute.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nIsn’t that weirder? She’s banging guys she likes for free.\\nYou’re like, “How much lobster can I get with this clam?”\\nIsn’t that way whorier?\\nI don’t know.\\nWhat do I know? I’m a feminist.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nA lot of prostitutes walk around my neighborhood.\\nYou’re supposed to say sex worker now, but I’ve given enough money, I should be able to call them whatever I want. But…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nSex is just such a strange thing.\\nWe all have sex. We like sex. You guys have sex.\\nPlease, send me a video.\\nYou know, sex is fun. We like it.\\nIf you charge for it, all of a sudden there’s a stigma.\\nWeird. Sex is the only thing on earth that gets sadder when you go pro.\\nHuh.\\nNothing else is like that.\\nMaybe bowling.\\nHmm.\\n“My friend’s a great bowler.” “That’s cool.”\\n“My other friend’s a professional bowler.” “That’s a shame.”\\nEither way, bowling or prostitution, holes are getting fingered in an alley.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah.\\nYeah, I’ve been with a lot of promiscuous gals in my day.\\nPaid for a couple of big old aborshes.\\nThat’s a thing, you know.\\nOne time I left the abortion clinic with a lady and there’s a guy protesting.\\nHe goes, “You’re a goddamn murderer.”\\nI don’t know about murderer. I really more just hired a hitman.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nHe’s like, “If it was up to me, you’d be in jail.”\\nIf I go to jail for this, I want murderer status.\\nI wanna look tough.\\nThe guys talking. “What are you in for?” “Grand theft auto.” “Assault.”\\nI’m like, “Murder.”\\nThey’re like, “Damn! Who’d you kill?”\\nI’m like, “Huh! A relative.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThey’re like, “Whoa, why’d you do that?” I’m like, “Caught him inside my girl.”\\n[CHUCKLES]\\nI miss that gal. She was fun, she was wild.\\nAfter the abortion, she was like, “We should celebrate with a drink.”\\nI was like, “I don’t think you should drink on an empty stomach.”\\n[LAUGHTER, GROANING]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nAh. All right.\\n[WHISTLING]\\nYeah.\\nBut, you know, it’s good you guys can come out for a yuk.\\nI know times are weird. The economy’s in the toilet.\\nGas prices are higher than Hunter Biden.\\nWho knows what’s going on out there, you know?\\nAll my friends are broke.\\nOne of my friends is broke but still buys the most crap.\\nHe just bought a Peloton.\\nYou ever see one of these things?\\nThree grand for this thing.\\nImagine explaining a Peloton to someone in a Third World country.\\nSome guy with no shoes on, on a dirt road, shabby clothes.\\n“Whoa, you spent $3,000 on a bike? Must be pretty fast.”\\n“Doesn’t move. Just sits in the living room.”\\n“In the living room? When you pedal, it generates power for your home?”\\n“No. Uses a lot of power. Got a big screen on the front.”\\n“Big screen? When you use it, you watch funny TV shows?”\\n“No, a better-looking person yells at you.”\\n“Oh. This thing sounds terrible. What’s the upside?”\\n“You eat too much takeout, you gotta burn some calories.”\\n“Whoa, whoa. What’s takeout?”\\n“That’s where a guy on a bicycle brings food to your house and you pay him.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“Wait. This guy’s got a real bike and you give him money? Why not do that?”\\n[SCOFFS] “What am I? A fucking immigrant? Come on.”\\nThat’s America. Yeah.\\nAny immigrants here tonight?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nHey, how are you? Where you from?\\nChina.\\n[MARK] China? All right. Sorry about the balloons. But, um, all right. Good one. Good to have you. Thank you. Just don’t cough.\\n[MAN] Ireland.\\nIreland? I was hoping for something browner.\\nAll right, okay.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nThanks for being here. And you seem sober, which is shocking.\\nAll right.\\n[MAN] Pakistan.\\nPakistan? Hey, hopefully only one of us bombs.\\nI don’t even know if that’s a thing. Um…\\nMexicans? Are you Mexican, sir?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nYeah, you’d look cute in a cage. All right.\\nSomebody check his papers, huh? All right.\\nSorry, that was a spicy one.\\nGood to have you. Sorry, sir. That joke was over the line.\\nAnd so are you. But, uh…\\nI’m jealous of immigrants, I really am. My buddy’s a Mexican immigrant. Been here eight years. He loves America. He never thinks about the bad parts. We got a lot of bad history. Slavery, Civil Rights, oppressing women, homophobia. He’s like, “I just got here.” [LAUGHS]\\nWhat a great position to be in.\\nAll the fun of America, not much of the hardship. It’s like becoming a firefighter on September 12th.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nImmigrants are great. Immigrants tend to appreciate America more than most Americans.\\nI’m from here, born and raised. I’m spoiled. I take it for granted. My grandparents are immigrants from Sicily. They never shut up. The American dream, the freedom, the opportunity. And I’m like, “Where the fuck’s my Uber Eats?” “Where the hell is that Pakistani with my food, goddammit?”\\nYeah. But I thought that was the big dream. You come to America, you make it big, you make a couple of bucks, you get rich. Boy, the rich thing is weird now. Feels like we hate rich people. Isn’t that weird? See that online a lot. “Fuck the rich, kill the rich, eat the rich.”\\nWhy are we all shitting on the thing we wanna be?\\nLike making fun of old people.\\n“Look at that old bastard. Probably shit his pants.”\\nYeah, that’s the goal.\\nWe’re all hypocrites.\\nWe all go to 7-Eleven, “Gimme that scratch-off.”\\nGuy goes by in a Ferrari. [IMITATES CAR]\\n“Rich prick. Come on, big money.”\\nWhich one is it? All of my friends are very left-leaning, liberal, “Down with hate, we gotta stop hate. But fuck rich people.”\\n“That feels pretty hateful.” “Well, I hate the 1%.”\\nLike, “Whoa, so you hate minorities?”\\nWe’re all so compassionate these days till someone’s doing better than you, then fuck them.\\nRich guy’s like, “My beach house burned down in Malibu.”\\n“Boo-fucking-hoo.”\\nHe’s like, “Well, my kids were in there.”\\n“I don’t get it. I invented something, now I don’t have feelings? Weird.”\\nAll these absolutes now. “Rich people are all evil.”\\nThat’s not how people work. They vary. Some are evil, some are nice.\\n“Cops are all bad.” No, some are bad, some are awesome.\\n“Teachers are heroes.” Some are heroes, some fuck their students.\\nRight?\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd that student is a hero.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYeah. All right.\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nI don’t hate any group. I like all the groups, you know?\\nI also like racial jokes.\\nYeah, those kind of went away.\\nI grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood.\\nWe’d say horrible things to each other. Everybody got along.\\nYou can’t make those jokes anymore, and we seem more tense than ever.\\nIt was fun. Cut the tension, you know?\\nThey’d be like, “Mark, you can’t dance.” I was like, “Well, you can’t swim. Ah!”\\nWe’re still friends to this day.\\nThen some stiff white guy, “You can’t say that.”\\nYou don’t know our relationship. That’s what we do.\\nYou walk in on me choking my wife. “Call the police.” No, she loves that.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou don’t always know the relationship.\\nWe’re just so obsessed with race now, it’s always on my mind.\\nOn the phone with my insurance agent. “What color’s your car?”\\nI was like, “Jeez. I thought you were progressive.”\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nAnd, look, I’m a pretty progressive guy.\\nBut sometimes we get so progressive these days\\nwe actually end up kinda racist again.\\nI used to just have my friend. Now I’m very aware he’s my Black friend.\\n“Don’t say anything stupid. Don’t offend him.” That’s not progress.\\nI’m obsessed with his skin color now. Never thought about it before.\\nEverything I say, I’m second-guessing.\\n“You’re always banging your girlfriend. You’re like a sex slave.”\\nAh, shit. Ah.\\n“No, I’m just saying, you know, you’re whipped.”\\nAh, damn.\\n“No, I mean, you know, I just wanna hang.”\\n[GROANS]\\nHe’s like, “Screw this, I’m outta here.”\\n“All right, I’ll see you later.” Jesus Christ. Holy Hell.\\nThat’s not healthy.\\nHope no Jews are offended. We got any Jews here?\\n[WHOOPING, WHISTLING]\\nHey, all right!\\nGet ’em!\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nJust joking, Jews. Thanks for coming out. Love the tribe. And do something about this weather, will you?\\nYeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI love the Jews.\\nMy Jewish friends and my Black friends butt heads a lot over who had it worse.\\nThat’s a big argument. Slavery or the Holocaust?\\nGot heated one night, almost came to blows.\\nMy Black friend had to be like, “We’ve got stuff in common.”\\n“Let’s focus on that. We’re both oppressed.”\\n“Both contribute a lot to the arts, and our grandparents are both ashy.”\\n[LAUGHTER, GROANING]\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\nJust saying, Jews and Black people, a lot in common.\\nI go to my Black friend’s house, closet’s got a big pile of shoes.\\nGo to the Holocaust Museum, there’s a big pile of… You get it.\\nBut, no.\\nBig fan of the Jews. I hate to see the anti-Semitism bubbling up these days.\\nThat’s a bummer. Some people aren’t having it.\\nI heard one guy go, “These Jews are acting like babies.”\\n“These Jews are acting like babies.”\\nI disagree. I think Jews are tough, I think they’re resilient.\\nI do, however, think babies are acting like Jews.\\nYeah.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI was at a diner last week with my buddy. He’s Jewish.\\nA baby one table over. They were doing the same shit.\\nBoth wearing little hats, you know.\\nBaby’s uncomfortable, squirming. I look at my friend, he’s like, “My back.”\\nThe bill came, they both shit their pants and left.\\nBut, you know, I make jokes, but I try to be a good honky ally to my Black brethren.\\nAn awkward moment for a white guy is going to see a slave movie with your Black friend.\\nAwkward. Did that a few years back. Still haunts me.\\nHanging out with two Black guys. “We should see a movie.” “Hell, yeah.”\\n“We should go see 12 Years A Slave.” I was like, “Ah. I’ll get the tickets.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“It’s on me.”\\nWe had to see 12 Years A Slave in Harlem in the theater.\\nI’m the only white guy in there. I’m so uncomfortable, I’m shaking.\\nMy friend’s like, “What’s your problem?” “I want to leave, but I can’t.”\\nHe’s like, “Now you know how the slaves felt.”\\nGod damn.\\nHe’s like, “We did 400 years. You can do two hours.”\\nI was like, “Yes, Master.” [CHUCKLES]\\nAnd that is how I made slavery about me.\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nThat’s what white people do. Yeah.\\nBut I think we’re making progress.\\nWe’ve got a Black mermaid now. That’s big. Yeah.\\nCan’t have a Jewish mermaid, ’cause you guys can’t fuck with shellfish.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nWe’ve got a Black mermaid. They’re making more.\\nPixar’s doing a Rapunzel movie.\\n“Rapunzel, let down your hair.” Rapunzel’s gonna be Black.\\nWhich is cool. But the Prince is gonna be white.\\nGonna be awkward when he goes, “Rapunzel, let down your hair.”\\nAnd she’s gonna be like, “You’re not touching this shit.”\\nBut it is horrible when you see some real racism go down.\\nI was on the bus last week. Black guy tried to get on the bus.\\nDriver’s like, “We’re full, buddy.”\\nHe’s like, “I’m just trying to get on the bus.”\\nHe goes, “You’re treating me like this ’cause I’m Black.”\\nI’m like, man, that is messed up to treat someone differently ’cause they’re Black.\\nThen I realized, wait a minute, we all do that.\\nBlack guy says the n-word, no big deal.\\nWhite lady, you say the n-word, I get an erection.\\nYou know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nBut sometimes you should treat groups differently, you know?\\nIf my white friend’s getting wild, “Dude, you’re crazy. You’re an animal.”\\nIf my Black friend’s getting wild, I’m like, “Dude.”\\n“You’re crazy.” [CHUCKLES]\\nI’m way nicer to Black people than I am to white people.\\nI was at the gym, white guy playing his music really loud.\\nWe’re all like, “It’s a public space. It’s rude. Get the hell out of here.”\\nHe leaves. Twenty minutes later, a Black guy comes in.\\nHe starts playing his music really loud. We’re all like, “Good tunes, brother.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI had a guy go, “You do that ’cause you’re scared of Black people.”\\nI’m not scared of Black people. I’m scared of cell phone cameras.\\nThat is terrifying, you know?\\nAt a restaurant, a Black guy’s like, “I got you.”\\nLike, “Whoa. I said vinegar. Vinegar. What the hell?”\\n“Salt and vinegar.”\\nThat’s a dicey one.\\nI like a dicey zinger. Some people get weird.\\nYou know who doesn’t like dicey jokes? TV writers.\\nThey’ve turned down everything I ever pitched.\\nI pitched this great sitcom about the 9/11 terrorists, but of course, they shot down the pilot.\\nBut, you know.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI know.\\nYou guys are fun. A lot of crowds are sensitive.\\nPeople are getting sensitive. My buddy is a vegan. Holy shit.\\nI’m walking on eggshells around him. He really hates that.\\nHe’s a great guy, but going out to eat with him is a nightmare.\\nHe’s got to have the Impossible Burger. You know about this?\\nLooks like meat, tastes like meat, feels like meat, but it’s not meat.\\nWeird. You hate something but want something just like it. Huh.\\nIt’s like a lesbian with a strap-on.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nYou hate dick, but it looks like a dick, feels like a dick.\\nI can’t believe it’s not dick.\\nIt’s beyond dick.\\nWe got any lesbians here tonight?\\n[WHOOPING]\\nHey, all right.\\nI think that was a guy. Uh…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nLesbians are underrepresented.\\nI travel the country doing comedy. I see gay bars everywhere.\\nThey always have funny names, like The Manhole or The Back Door.\\nWhere’s all the fun lesbian bars? Where’s Clitz, with a z?\\nClitz. Perfect name for a lesbian bar, ’cause no guy could find it.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnd we’ll put it right in the hood. Aha.\\n[BELCHES]\\nAll right. Yeah.\\n[CHEERING]\\nComedy. All right.\\n[WHISTLING, APPLAUSE]\\nBut, hey, it’s good you guys are out now, ’cause you’re not watching the news. Too much news.\\nThe news is dark. It’s on 24/7.\\nThe news is more twisted than ever. Saw a news headline the other day.\\n“Transgender inmate impregnates female prisoner.”\\nI was like, “Wow.”\\n“Where is that porn?”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nI’ve been watching porn my whole life, never saw a title that creative, right?\\nMan, the news is dark. The news is more fucked-up than porn now.\\nAnd it’s on everywhere. Every airport, bar, restaurant.\\nPut some porn on. I think we’d be in a better mood.\\nI was at the Amtrak station the other day. There was news on the wall, on TV.\\n“Man attacks multiple people on trains.”\\nJeez, I’m about to get on an Amtrak.\\nPut some porn on, that’d be better.\\nThen it’s, “Man runs a train on multiple people.”\\nAll right! Now I’m ready to board. Choo-choo. [LAUGHS]\\nThe news is crazy. Isn’t it weird we have two news channels in America that tell you two completely different news?\\nHow did that happen? Just tell me the news.\\nI don’t want your spin or bias.\\nThank God we don’t do that with the weather.\\nWouldn’t that be insane, if we had political, opinionated weather?\\nWe’re going to the beach tomorrow, let’s check the left-wing weather.\\nBoop.\\n“Hey, folks. 90 degrees outside. Beautiful day for an abortion.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“We got some dark clouds coming in. Excuse me, clouds of color.”\\n“And, as you can see, we’ve got tropical storm Kelly brewing.”\\n“Slowly transitions to Hurricane Kevin, but we don’t judge.”\\n“We’re not sure what the future holds, but it’s female. Back to you, they/them.”\\nHoly moly, I was just trying to get the goddamn weather.\\nThat was weird. I got nothing out of that. All right.\\nLet’s check the right-wing weather. Maybe that will be more informative.\\nBoop.\\n“Hey, folks. Grab your boots, it’s 100% chance of storming the Capitol.”\\n“Oh yeah. Gonna be a lot of hailing and heiling out there, and…”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“We got some ice in the Midwest.”\\n“We need some ICE at the border, I’ll tell you that right now.”\\n“Grab your coats, ’cause we hate snowflakes. Ooh!”\\n“Praise the Lord, and back to you, sugar tits.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]\\nUh-huh.\\nAll right.\\nYeah, the news, it’s all politics now.\\nI’m so sick of politics. It’s the new sports team.\\nPeople make it their whole personality. It’s fricking exhausting. Yeah.\\nI look at politicians the same way I look at CBD gummies.\\nA lot of people believe in them, but I’m not sure they do anything.\\nThey don’t fix problems anymore, just change the name.\\n“We’re not in a recession, it’s a financial hiccup.”\\nWhat? We’re all broke.\\nThe banks are failing. What are you talking about?\\nThey do it with everything. “He’s not obese, he’s a person of size.”\\nWhat? He’s fat as shit.\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“He’s not homeless, he’s unhoused.”\\nHe just diarrhea-d on my porch.\\nLike, who cares what we’re calling it. Let’s fix it.\\nHow long till bad guys start doing that? “I’m not racist, I’m ethnically choosy.”\\nHmm?\\n“I’m not a school shooter, I’m a student body minimizer.”\\nHuh?\\n[APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER]\\nAh, school shootings.\\nIt’s a problem.\\nIt’s a problem in this country. I was just in Canada.\\nThey’re nicer than us. They don’t shoot each other.\\nThey stab. Isn’t that nice? It’s kinda romantic.\\nWe shoot in America. More efficient.\\nShooting somebody is like breaking up via text. Easy, no mess.\\nStabbing is like breaking up in person.\\nYou see that look in their eye. “I know. This is hard for me too.”\\nGet back to your buddy, “How’d it go?” You’re like, “She fucking freaked out.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAnother reason women are better than men, you don’t see a lot of female school shooters.\\nWhat’s going on there? I googled it, there’s been two.\\nHuh. Anybody ever heard of them?\\nIsn’t that weird? Whether it’s gun violence or the WNBA…\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n…nobody’s watching these female shooters.\\nMan or woman.\\nGotta put up some more numbers, ladies.\\n[APPLAUSE]\\nI think I can solve school shootings.\\nI know people love guns. It’s America, people wanna buy a gun.\\nBut I think if a high-school kid buys a semiautomatic weapon, that should be a big deal. That should be public.\\nLet’s make that an event, like a wedding.\\nYou gotta send invitations, get your family to the gun shop.\\nThe shop owner, he’s like the priest.\\nHe holds up the gun, “If anyone has any objections, speak now, or this guy will forever own this piece.”\\nAnd we get some feedback.\\n“I’m his uncle. I don’t think he should have that gun ’cause he was molested.”\\n“I know that ’cause I did it.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n“Probably a bad idea.”\\nI think half of these shooter kids are incel, virgin weirdos.\\nThey need to get laid, but it’s harder to get laid than it is to buy a gun.\\nYou can buy a gun at Walmart. You don’t wanna fuck anybody at Walmart.\\nThat’s why every gun shop should double as a whorehouse.\\nSlow these kids down a little bit, you know?\\nSome angry kid comes in, “I need an AR-15.”\\nWe’re like, “Whoa, whoa. How about a Brazilian 18?”\\n[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]\\nYeah!\\n[CHEERING]\\nYeah. Then some kid has sex with her, goes back to school, he’s like, “What the fuck was I so angry about?”\\n“Holy hell. Life is good!”\\nSomeone’s like, “Are you smoking?” He’s like, “No, I’m paying a hooker.”\\n[LAUGHTER]\\nAll right, thanks a lot. I’m Kevin Hart. You guys are great.\\nHave a good night. Comedy! Thank you.\\nQueef it up!\\nPraise Allah!\\nI’m gay!\\n[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]\\n[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]\\n[WHISTLING, CHEERING]\\n[MUSIC CONTINUES]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMark Normand, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Denver!\\n[cheering and applause continues]\\n[Patton laughs] Oh my God! Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\n[cheering continues]\\nThank you. Oh my God! Yes! Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. Um… Hey, I broke my foot. Yeah. That’s how I started my year. I broke my foot. Uh… It was… It took two… It happened in two parts. Uh, the second part was I slipped off a curb and I landed wrong. That was the second part. The first and most important part was I turned 53. That is the crucial part.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI… You turn… Once you get past 50, everything’s fatal. I… When I was in my twenties, I would walk into propellers and put some Bactine on it. I was fine. And now if a pine cone falls near me, my spine implodes. I don’t know what… Like that. [audience laughs] Broke my foot, and then the day after… I’m gonna drop a name. All right. Uh, the day after I broke my foot, Glenn Howerton, my friend Glenn Howerton…\\n[audience cheers]\\n…who is almost 50, but for this bit he’s over 50. I needed to… Come on, who cares about logic? He broke his collarbone. So I called him up, gave him a little solidarity, a little support. “Hey, man. I broke my foot.” “What happened?” In my mind, I’m thinking, “Well, he was probably reaching for a bag of SunChips wrong, and his collarbone broke or something.” And he said, “Yeah, I was snowboarding. I landed a flip wrong.” All right. Fuck off. Fuck off.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou don’t need to go to that much hassle. Once you get to a certain age, you don’t need… I don’t even think that’s what happened. I think he’s lying to me. I think… I think somebody slammed a door near him, and then his collarbone fell into his ass cheek. And then he told his wife, “Duct-tape me to a snowboard and push me down a black diamond trail, please.” “Give me some dignity for God’s sake.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna drop another name. A month after I broke my foot, Tony Hawk broke his…\\n[audience cheering]\\n…broke his femur in two. Pow! Landed a vertical wrong. In his warehouse, doing his verticals, landed it wrong. Broke his femur. DMs me a picture of his X-ray. He’s like, “Looks like we’re in the same boat, buddy.” I’m like, “No, we’re fucking not.” You… [audience laughing] You just Jackie-Channed yourself into even more coolness. [audience laughs] He found a whole other level of cool. I slipped off a curb like someone’s aunt that saw a bird. That is how I went down.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI went down in the most embarrassing way possible. [audience chuckling] And the one weird thing that happened, ’cause when I did it I was still in my 23-year-old denial head of, “I just twisted my ankle. I’ll drive home.” I was at work. “I’ll drive home. I’ll be fine.” Driving home, it’s hurting worse. “Oh, this actually might be a real thing.” I get home. I can barely get out of the car now. And I’m limping across the street to my house. And it’s really hurting, and then a car pulls up, these two women are driving, and the driver rolls her window down and says, “You okay?” I’m like, “Oh, I twisted my ankle. I live right here.” “I’m going inside, put some ice on it.” And then, and this haunts me, she said, “Well, don’t give up.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhich… Wait. What? Holy shit! What was the look on my face? [audience laughing] What did I… Did she… “He’s gonna kill himself. Pull over. Pull over.” “Hey, don’t give up.” “Let me play this Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush song. This’ll really…” “Let’s listen to this.” Maybe that was just my face left over from the shutdown and the pandemic. Is that how my face permanently is now? Because I didn’t do the shutdown well at all. I did a bad shutdown. I planned a great shutdown. I planned an amazing… Remember when the shutdown happened? Supposed to stay home, and you had that little memory of all the times you said, “If I could just get a month off, I could get my shit together.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I could get my life… I just need a month off.” I planned a great shutdown. I executed the worst one ever. Oh my God, the list I made. The list we all made. We all made the same list? Yes, you did. All the great books you were gonna read. All the great books. All the skills you were gonna learn. Oh my God, we couldn’t wait to work on ourselves. If I had actually followed the list that I made, there’d be a different man standing in front of you right now. He’d be 30 pounds lighter. He’d be speaking fluent Italian.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhen all of you walked in, there would have been a handmade raspberry almond crumble tart on everyone’s chair, on each chair. I would have hand-milled the flour this morning. [audience laughing] You would have eaten it off of an origami plate. [audience laughs] When you’re done eating, you throw the plate down, it pops up into a frog. Oh my God! Oh, the plans I had! [audience laughing] I didn’t do any of that shit. I ate Doritos for breakfast, and I watched Deadwood twice all the way through. Watched it. Finished it. Back to episode one. Hit play.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat’s all I fucking did. And then I went crazier than a barn full of clown pubes. That is what I did during the shutdown. And listen, when I… When I say, “Crazier than a barn full of clown pubes…” [audience laughing] …I’m not kink-shaming. I’m not judging. [audience laughs] Clowns have as much right to have a varied and experimental, adventurous sex life. I’m saying the source of the crazy isn’t the clown pubes. It’s the having the thought and then the follow-through of “I’m gonna fill this barn…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“…with the p…” I just want that to be clear. That the source of the crazy is the barn. The barn full of pubes isn’t even the crazy. It was the act of filling the barn… Listen, if you… If you just filled a barn with pubes, you’ve checked off the crazy box. [audience laughing] But this person went, “I’m putting obstructions in my way.” “I will only collect the pub…” Also, how do you… There’s no way to know. Clown pubes don’t look different. Like, they’re not bright orange. They’re not rainbow-colored. Look. Some are, but a lot… There’s a lot of… Listen. There… There’s a lot of non-clown pubes that are bright orange and rainbow-colored. That’s not what I’m saying here. What I’m saying is there’s no way that… Okay, this is what I’m saying. Wait. Fuck. Okay. If you… Like, okay, if you’re walking around…\\n[audience laughing]\\n…and there’s a barn, and you open those two big doors, there’s a wall of pubes, and you go, “Well, there’s a maniac roaming the countryside.” If someone said, “Those are only clown pubes.” Like, “Oh! We gotta call the National Guard.” Wait a minute. What? ‘Cause there’s no way to prove that. [audience laughing] Oh, okay, wait. You could do this. Every time… Every time that you collect… Not… Not a… Not a clump. That’s gross. Not a clump of… No. [audience laughing] Clump is too gross. Thatch? No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThatch is too folksy. That’s… That’s the other… Like, if Cracker Barrel opened a BDSM store, they would call it the Thatch of Pubes. That’s what it would be called. You’d go down to the Th… It’d probably be connected to the Cracker Barrel. You’d go in, get a nice breakfast, then go, “Hang on. I gotta pop into the Thatch of Pubes.” [audience laughs] “Pay the bill. I’ll meet you at the front.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThatch of Pu…\\n♪ Thatch of Pubes ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughing] We… ♪ We’ve got nipple clamps And scented lubes ♪\\n[audience laughs]\\nWe’ve got floggers, and paddles, and dildos. Oh my! And a tower of butt plugs that kisses the sky. [audience laughs] Tell ’em Petunia the pube pig sent ya. [audience laughs] Oink. All right. Um… [audience laughs] Handful. Handful of clown pubes. That’s non-gender specific. Every time you collect a handful of clown pubes, you take a Polaroid. You have a Polaroid, so you’re kneeling down. You’re collecting the pubes. You got your baggy. Gotta do it full length. Get the whole clown in there. He or she’s gotta be in their wig, their makeup, holding that day’s newspaper… [audience laughing] …so you know. Then you take a hole-punch, punch a hole through the Polaroid, get a ribbon, put it through that hole, tie the other end of the ribbon to the… the… the handful of pubes, toss it in the barn… Every handful of pubes is accounted for. There you go. And that’s how you would pro… Fuck, no. No, you can’t. You know why? No, that doesn’t work, because then someone can go, “Technically, you didn’t fill the barn with pubes because the ribbon and the Polaroid took up…” No, it has to be complete confidence in the speaker and total trust in the listener. When you say I tho… This is what’s happening right now, okay? We’re starting this set out. Let’s go on a journey for the next hour. I started off pretty strong, I think. I think I’ve won your trust, but you know what? You shouldn’t 100%… No. Not yet though.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBecause what you’ve got… Listen. What I’ve done, comedically, creatively, I have opened the barn doors. [audience laughing] And there’s a wall of pubes. [audience laughing] And yes, it’s impressive, but you’re right to go, “You know what?” “I bet that wall of pubes, I bet that’s a half an inch thick.” “And there’s a big sheet of plywood behind, and the rest of the barn is empty.” “I’ve been screwed over too many…” You’re right to think that. What I’m… This is what I’m doing. As a comedian, I’m inviting you… I’m saying I want you to run as hard as you can into this wall of pubes, and then, I want you to fight your way back, just fight your way to the back of the barn… [audience laughing] …until you’re cocooned in pubes. You know what I mean? At the back. And when your hand hits that back wall, you will think, “I met a man of honor.” That is what you will think. [audience laughing] That is what I want for us. Not me, not you, us. All of us. That’s what I want. Those are the kind of bits I wrote during the shutdown. I’d be awake for eight days in a row… [applause] Five in the morning, “The fucking Polaroid doesn’t even work!” Goddamn it! [audience cheering and applauding] I bought a trampoline.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot a giant backyard… One of those little workout ones. Yeah. Little tiny trampoline. It’s called a rebounder. Awesome. You get up on it. You hop up and down, get the lymphatic system going, “Here you go. Ooh. Out, in. Forward, back. Ski it out.” Great workout. Got it right at the beginning of the pandemic. “I’m gonna stay fit during this thing, man. I got my new rebounder.” It came out of the box, not a speck of dust on it. Oh, I was so excited. I could feel how excited the rebounder was. You could feel it. He was like, “I’m gonna make a difference in this house.” “I belong here. I’m gonna change things for the better.” I’m like, “That’s right, little rebounder. Wanna go inside the house?” “You wanna go in the gym?” He’s like, “Yeah.” We have a gym in our house. It’s a room with an elliptical in it. We call it a gym. [audience laughs] I take him inside. Oh, he’s so excited. I put him down. “I’ll see you tomorrow, little rebounder.” He goes, “Yeah.” We both looked over at the elliptical. [audience laughs] Against the wall. Clothes hanging off of it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nCovered in dust. And I could feel the rebounder’s heart break. I could feel his… You know what it felt like? It felt like the rookie cop fresh out of the academy. He’s like, “Give me the worst precinct in town. I’ll turn it around!” “I’ve got progressive policing techniques, community outreach.” “I’ll make a difference.” And he shows up that first day, big thermos of green tea, little keto lunch, he’s all excited. Looks over in the corner, “Who’s at his desk?” The old homicide cop. [audience laughs] Eight bullet holes in him. Eleven colostomy bags. [audience laughing] He’s having his seventh Viceroy of the morning. [audience laughing] [Patton exhales] That’s the elliptical. [audience laughing] Looks at the little rookie rebounder, “You’re gonna learn, kid.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You think I didn’t have dreams when I came here, huh?” “I was top of the line!” “You can stream movies on me, TV shows, mountain programs, everything!” “Oh! I was gonna turn this house of fatties around.” [audience laughing] “That guy that just dropped you off, he was on me day one.” “Cute little workout outfit.” “Little iPhone. He downloaded a bunch of podcasts on it.” “Ooh, a thinker!” [audience laughing] “He gets up on me, stretch those little fat thighs, pumping them up and down.” [grunting] “Thought he was gonna go the distance.” “He didn’t make it past the first Blue Apron ad.” [inhales, exhales] [audience laughing] “Hopped off of me.” “Went and checked his texts in the crapper.” [audience laughs] “He never came back.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Oh, he’ll be here tomorrow.” “Oh, he’ll be in his little workout outfit.” “He’ll probably put a little playlist on his iPhone.” “Yeah.” “He’s a Gen X-er in his fifties.” “I bet it’ll be all early ’80s New Wave pop.” [audience laughs] “That’s how he’s gonna get thin. Nostalgia.” [audience laughs] “He’ll hop up on you, start jumping up and down like a gibbon full of Skittles.” [audience laughs] “What’ll be the first song he listens to? I can call it right now.” “It’ll be the Go-Go’s ‘Our Lips Are Sealed.'” “That’ll be the first song.” “And you’ll be all excited. ‘Oh, he’s gonna go the full hour'”! “He won’t make it past the bridge.” [audience laughs] “The minute Jane Wiedlin starts singing, “Hush my darling,” he’ll hop off of you, he’ll check his texts in the crapper.” “He’ll never come back.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Extinguish all joy within you, and nothing’ll ever hurt you again.” [audience laughs] I just pitched the saddest Pixar movie in the… If they do a movie with the Safdie brothers, that’s gotta be their movie. Harvey Keitel is the elliptical. [audience laughing] Timothée Chalamet is the rebounder. [audience laughing] And Frances McDormand is the half-inflated exercise ball. [audience laughs] Went fucking crazy during the shutdown. My rock-bottom, psychologically, during the shutdown happened on the same day as my wife and daughter’s. We all hit crazy rock-bottom at the same time. Um, it was a weekday. We’re all in the house, staying inside. Doing our part. Stop the spread. My daughter’s in the kitchen, and out of nowhere, she says, “Hey, there’s a weird guy in our backyard.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat the fuck? I go running out, “What?” Looking out, “I don’t see anybody. You saw someone?” She goes, “Some weird guy just walked across our backyard and went around the back. He’s back there right now.” I’m like, “Oh shit!” We have cameras all over the property. I have an app on my phone. You click it and can look at what the camera sees. I’m waiting for it. I’m gonna go back and confront him. I just wanna know what I’m about to deal with. I don’t know what’s back there. What if it’s a lost hippie wanting someone to hacky-sack with him? “I’ll hacky-sack with you.” [audience laughing] Could be a maniac, nude, with a bucket of chicken on his dick, holding a sword. I don’t know what’s back… I just wanna be ready. [audience laughing] But the cameras aren’t loading, and I’m waiting for it. Goddamn it. And then my wife pushes past us, doesn’t say anything and goes striding across the back lawn. She’s got a white summer dress on flowing in the wind, barefoot. And she’s holding a pink, aluminum baseball bat. [audience laughing] And she has serious Manson girl energy coming off of her, like…\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Look at that hot, hippie chick that I wanna fuck and get murdered by.” “Yay.” [laughing] So, she… It takes me a second to realize what she’s doing, then I go clomping after her, in my flip-flops and cargo pants, but she’s already around the corner and she’s already laying into this guy. Before I can turn the corner, I hear her screaming at him, “Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my yard!” “I will fuck you up.” [audience laughing] [audience cheering and applauding] So… I… I turned the corner. She’s in a stance. [audience laughs] Like Uma in Kill Bill, she’s ready to go. [audience laughs] The guy she’s yelling at, little scruffy looking, didn’t look crazy, didn’t look homeless, holding a cell phone, just looked a little off, and she’s screaming and yelling at him, “What the fuck are you doing here?” Now I’m gonna stop the story and tell you what was actually happening. There was something wrong with our air conditioner. I…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI called our contractor and said, “Can you send someone to the house to fix the AC?” Without telling us, he gave this guy our address and gate code and sent him to the house. So yes, massive misunderstanding. My wife is now screaming at him, and she’s just fucking… Just blazing Valkyrie, shrieking at the top of her lungs at this guy, “Who the fuck are you?” Now, to his discredit… [audience laughing] …when there is a blazing-eyed Valkyrie holding a vagina-colored piece of metal… [audience laughing] …threatening to kill you, answer in short, declarative sentences. [audience laughing] [applause] This guy… This guy was going, “Who’s anybody really, man? Like…” “Every day was… Oh, the wheel in the sky…” Oh, goddamn it. Now she’s got both hands on the bat. She’s gonna swing on the guy. And then he looks at me. And when he looks at me, that’s when he gets scared.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe started saying, “My name is Michael. Your guy Steve sent me here to figure…” And my wife’s like, “Oh my God, he didn’t tell us. I’m so sorry.” “Oh my God, I’m gonna call him right now.” “I’m… This was… This really got off on the wrong foot.” “How about you leave…” The guy was more than happy to leave. [audience laughs] I’m sure he was driving home going, “That poor bastard. Oh my God.” “I’m sure the sex is amazing but…” Um… [audience laughing] A lot of you hear the story and go, “That’s not very manly of you.” “You let your wife… God knows what could’ve happened!” I argue the opposite. [audience laughs] I say that our timing and placement made us a more effective home invasion deterrent. [audience laughs] ‘Cause remember he never got scared when she was screaming at him? He just kept going, “I…” You know why? He couldn’t process what he was seeing.\\n[audience laughs]\\nGorgeous Valkyrie, vagina-colored metal, screaming. Too much. Too fucking much. Couldn’t process it. And also, again, the energy she’s giving off is outer-space sex vixen about to murder you. [audience laughing] Can’t process it. You know what he could process? Me. Standing five feet behind her, ’cause the energy I was giving off was, “I can’t do nothing when she gets like this.” “I… I tried to get her to go to the nervous hospital, see?” “She said she’d burn the house down.” “She’s killed so many Amazon delivery drivers.” “I can’t dig no more holes in the desert. Please just run!” [audience laughing] I’m doing some poses that we can freeze for the Netflix save screen. A little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] [Patton chuckles]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThere’s gotta be… What if I did… What if I use… Here’s what I’m gonna do. Watch. Like this. [audience laughing and cheering] Now, look. That’s… That’s not a bit in the special, but if you’re watching Netflix, and that “coming up next,” you’re like, “Let’s watch a minute of that.” Like, “What the fuck is this?” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] I’m vaxxed and boosted. Yes, I am. Thank you. It shouldn’t… [cheering and applause] Thank you. But… That… Look. Thank you. It’s also sad that gets applause at this point, isn’t it? You get applause for taking the most basic care of your health? That’s like me going, “Folks, I wipe after I shit. Thank…” No. No, no. [cheering and applause] People. No. I’m no… I’m no hero now. It’s the lumberjacks who cut down the trees that make the toilet… Those are the heroes. [audience laughing] [man] Yeah! [chuckles] I assume there’s a lumberjack here. All right, um…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Patton chuckles] Or a really enthusiastic wiper. Um… [audience laughing] I got my vax right when the vax came out. Immediately. I didn’t jump the line. I didn’t use my privilege, but… I acted on some inside information, and I feel bad about this. This is how I did it. Uh… Right when the vaccine came out, I have a friend, lives out in Riverside. And he calls me and says, “I don’t know if I should tell you this, but, uh, out where I’m living, it’s MAGA country.” “No one is getting the vaccine.” “There’s a Rite Aid near me, a woman sitting at a table.” “Everyone that walks in she asks if they want it. No one will get it.” “They’re throwing crates of this shit out the back.” “If you drive out here, you will get a shot.” “Don’t even make an appointment.” So I drove out there. I walk in. There’s a woman at a table. I go, “Hi, excuse me. I’d like to get a vaccine.” She was like, “You would?” Like, she had no… [audience laughing] She had run out of Tolkien novels to read. Like, “Yeah. Let me get you set up.” Like, “Go stand over there.” While I’m waiting, my friend was right, everyone that walked in, “Would you like a vaccine?” “No, thank you.” And one guy gave her a, uh… “[scoffs] Yeah, no thanks.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nLike, “Yeah, nice try, Deep State. I think I’m gonna, uh…” “I think I’m gonna stay tracker-free for the time being if that’s all right.” “Hang on. Yeah. I’m at the Rite Aid again. Yeah.” “They tried to get a fucking track… Hang on. I’m losing you.” “There you are. Yeah, no. I’m off the grid, man. That’s…” “Right. I’ll call you later.” Got my shot. Got my second shot, then boosted twice. I’m fucking fine. In 1955, the polio vaccine came out. 1955. We were two years away from satellites. There were no satellites! And America could not have been more backward, racist, homophobic, sexist, and these non-satellite-having, racist dipshits lined the fuck up to get their fucking vaccine! [cheering and applause] What the fuck! [cheering and applause continues] “Give me that shot. I can’t police these water fountains from a wheelchair.” [audience laughing] “I can’t beat up queers inside an iron lung! Give me my science!” “What am I, a caveman?” [audience laughing] Now it’s the year 2022, which, first off, doesn’t sound like a real year, does it? [audience laughs] Doesn’t that sound made up? Like you’re watching a cheap science-fiction film, “In the year 2022…” “Oh, you’re just throwing numbers together. Jesus!” “Who wrote this shit?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s 2022. We have robots on Mars. They send us TikTok videos. [audience laughing] Half of the country’s like, “That needle’s got witch poison in it, I tells ya.” “You ain’t putting no witch poison in me.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] “Keep your wizard jab away from me.” “I got to watch the video that the Mars robot sent to the world brain I keep it in my pocket.” [audience laughing] “But keep all that science away from me.” If that attitude had existed in 1955, the government would have had to do one of those PSAs, like a little cartoon dancing, hypodermic needle coming out, you know. [audience laughing] “Who do I gotta blow to cure polio?” Like little… [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] Yes. That’s right, jabby. Tell everyone about your benefits. [audience laughs] “My benefits? Your fucking legs work. How’s that for a benefit?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“You medieval shitheads.” [audience laughing] It’s a different world now, man. It’s a different world. Isn’t it? Cruise ships? Oh, you’ll never see a cruise ship again. Kiss that goodbye. Our grandkids won’t know what a buffet is. Oh. [audience laughs] Fuck, Covid changed everything. First off, every cruise ship is booked up to the year 2026. People cannot wait to get aboard the plague barge and sail the bounding main. “Oh, let me die near a water slide!” [audience laughing] Not only are buffets gonna come back, they’re gonna come back with this weird, own-the-libs vengeance. Every one of them’s gonna have an agenda. “Come on down to Captain Covid’s Alpha Males Only buffet!” [audience laughing] “You the kind of left-wing soy boy that needs a sneeze guard over your clam chowder, or are you able to fuck your wife?” “Then come on down to Captain Covid’s…” [audience laughing] “You show us proof you ain’t been vaccinated, you get a free platter of room-temperature scallops.” [audience laughing] “That’s right.” [chuckles] Oh… I was listening to ’70s on 7 on the way here. Yeah, on my XM Sirius satellite dial. You like ’70s music? You hit number seven. All the ’70s music you can have, ’70s on 7. You like ’80s music? You hit number eight.\\n[audience laughs]\\n’80s on 8. Do you like ’90s music? Guess what you hit. Number nine! [audience laughing] Do you like ’40s music? Well, you don’t hit number four. You used to, ’40s on 4. Now, channel 71. ’40s Junction. You like ’50s music? Well, it’s channel 72. ’50s Gold. You like ’60s music? Seventy-three, ’60s Gold. Why did those three channels get moved to the outer rim of the XM Sirius universe? I will tell you why. Their listeners are dying. [audience laughing] ’40s, ’50s, ’60s. Those listeners are dropping like… The fucking ’40s channel has five listeners left. [audience laughing] Three World War II veterans and a couple of contrarian hipsters. That’s it. That’s all that’s left. “You know who’s punk rock? Artie Shaw.” Fuck off.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd we can laugh and enjoy it, but hey, during our lifetimes, ’70s, ’80s, ’90s will go marching up the dial. That’s how you can track how the generations are dying, by where they’re putting the stations. [audience laughing] Keep the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s easy. I hope when they do that, that they take a little time and give some consideration to the names the way they did for the ’40s channel, ’40s Junction, train station, evocative. I get it. Picture in my head. And then they just gave up. ’50s Gold, ’60s… Ah, who care… What? You couldn’t do “Poodle Skirts and Milkshakes”? You couldn’t do “Patchouli Oil and Love Beads,” or whatever? [audience laughing] Give the ’70s channel a name emblematic of the decade. You know, “Your Mother and I Are Separating Radio.” How about that? That’s good. Sure. [audience laughing] Yeah. “Giant Candles Everywhere For Some Reason Tunes.” [audience laughing] The ’80s could be “Trapper Keeper Tunes.” [audience cheering and applauding] And then the ’90s channel could just be… [groans] [audience laughing] [groaning] I don’t know… That was Abra Moore’s “Four-Leaf Clover” on… [groans]\\n[audience laughing]\\n[groans] [audience laughing] Hi. Do you live here in Denver, ma’am? I live in Colorado Springs. [Patton] You live in Colorado Springs? Nice. Thank you for making the drive. [woman] No problem. Okay. What do you… [laughing] Okay, glad I got that straight. It wasn’t a problem. Thank God. Okay. Guys, it wasn’t a problem. It’s cool. [audience laughing] [Patton chuckles] Do you work in Colorado Springs? What do you do? I’m a doctor. [Patton] You’re a doctor. Oh my God, a brainiac. All right, um… What kind of medicine do you practice? I’m a pediatric neurologist. Pediatric neurologist. Oh my God! [audience cheering] You’re like… [cheering and applause] You are serving your community. You are helping children. You have a positive job that you have a positive attitude towards. This is comedy death. I need to get off of you right now. There’s nothing here. [audience laughing] I need to talk to a meth cook or a divorcee. This is… [audience laughs] “I help children live.” [sliding beep] All right. Shit. [audience laughing] Is this, uh… Are you with her? You guys together? Is this the hubby? The husband. The husband. What do you do, sir? I’m a lawyer. [Patton] You’re a lawyer? Ah… [audience laughing] [kisses] Finally.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSome evil. [audience laughing and applauding] Oh God, if it’s some kind of positive community outreach law, I’m gonna fucking… What kind of law do you practice, sir? I prosecute juvenile sex crimes. You prosecute juvenile sex offenders. Well…\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhen you say juvenile sex offenders, do you mean people who commit sex offenses against juveniles, or juveniles who are sex offenders? Juveniles who are sex offenders. Juveniles who are sex offenders. Gotta be very careful with the phrasing. And when you say… And then what happens? Like, they get… Why am I…? What is this, a…? I gotta… Me sitting down was good for that one laugh. I’m not gonna do the rest of my show like, “So what do you do?” [audience laughing] What the hell am I doing?\\n[applause]\\nYou are prosecuting the juvenile sex offenders. Okay. And you are a neurological pediatrician. So a kid whose brain maybe isn’t working correctly, you help fix it. And the ones you can’t fix, he puts away, right? Is that how… [audience laughing] There we go. [audience laughing] There’s your next Marvel team-up. All right. So… [laughs]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat was cute and dark at the same time. Rare to find that. It’s like a goth girl holding a kitten. All right. [audience laughing] How about you? Do you live here in Denver?\\n[man] I do.\\nYou do? What do you do in Denver? Uh, I work in a bar and I’m a student. You work in a bar and you’re a student. Oh, it’s a 1980s Tom Hanks movie. All right. So…\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat are you studying right now? Uh, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. And then, by day, he patrols the Internet. At night, it’s Slippery Nipples for secretaries, right? [audience laughing] What, uh… So you’re a bartender, and so do you want to eventually work in cybersecurity? Obviously. [man] Yeah. And the bartending’s paying the bills. Paying for you to learn. What is the… What’s the scariest thing you’ve learned so far in terms of cybersecurity? How close are we to some huge hack attack where suddenly the ATMs don’t work and all of our porn searches are on the internet? When does that happen? [audience laughs] Um… Pretty much nothing is private. [Patton] Pretty much nothing is private. Well, we all know that at this point. That’s not… Oh my God, have you ever… Okay, when you were growing up, was there, like, some asshole that bullied you or was really shitty, and now that you’re learning your cybersecurity skills, you could go digging into this person’s life and just dis-fucking-mantle it if you wanted to?\\n[audience laughing]\\nHas that temptation ever crossed your head? Pretty frequently. Have you… Oh! Have you done searches of old bullies’ names and stuff like that? I’ve… I’ve chosen not to. You’ve chosen not to. [audience laughs] That is a very lawyerly response. That was… Did you catch that? [audience laughing] Oh, man. Is this the wife or girlfriend? Uh, yes. [Patton] Which one? [laughter] Girlfriend. [Patton] Girlfriend! Oh! And what do you do? I’m an educator. [Patton] You’re an educator. And what do you… Thank you. [cheering and applause] Wow. What, uh… What do you… What areas do you educate in? I help high schoolers, um, access free college credit. Help high schoolers access free college credit. Does the… That’s cool. Does the, um… Does the sleeve tattoo help break the ice when they’re like, “She’s cool”? “She’s all right.” Yep. That must help. [woman] It does, yeah. Do you go in with the sleeve tattoo visible? Or do they make you wear a long sleeve? I bust it all out. [Patton] You bust it all out, sit there… “Let’s get you some fucking credit while you look at The Gashlycrumb Tinies right there, man. There you go.” You got some ink too. How long you been going out? Three years. Four. Three or four years. Three or four years. [audience laughing] Mmm. Some cybersecurity, if you know what I’m saying. Ah, come on, people. Um…\\n[audience laughing]\\nAre you… Do you live together? Oh, nice! Are you gonna… She looks awesome in… And then he can get you, like, free credit card shit and everything. I mean, come on. [audience laughs] It’s a match made in heaven. Make it happen. Couldn’t he use his cybersecurity to get kids free college credit? Change their grades, get them into Harvard. There’s another fucking team-up. All right. [audience cheering and applauding] I have two superhero teams in the front row. Oh, hello sir. [audience laughing] Shorts in the front row. Ballsy. [audience laughing] That’s it. You have way more self-confidence than I will ever have. Do you live here in Denver? I do. [Patton] And what do you do in Denver? I work in Boulder, actually. You work in Boulder. Live in Denver, work in Boulder. What do you do in Boulder? I work for a grocery store. You work for a grocery store. With that facial hair? They’re cool with that or…? [laughter] What… I’m not gonna ask what grocery store. That’s weird. [man] I bet you can figure it out. Probably could. Hang on. What is your specific job at the grocery store? I’m a manager. You’re a manager at the grocery store. Do you manage the whole store or one department? Um… Yeah. [audience laughing] Yeah, part of it. Yeah. Part of it. The liquor section? What part do you, um…?\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou seem amazed at hearing that you’re working at a grocery store coming out of you. “I work at a grocery store! I…” [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] And, uh, who are you here with? Is this your friend? There’s your friend. And where do you work? Uh, I work from home. You work from home. [man] In sales. In sales. I sell light bulbs. [Patton] You sell light bulbs. Are you asking me? You seem to be like, “I sell light…” You’re answering my questions like I’m a homicide cop. You’re like, “I-I sell light bulbs?” Like, it’s not… [audience laughing] You sell light bulbs from your home. I’m a lighting salesman. You’re a lighting salesman, so you stay in your house. You call people up or get on the internet with them? On the internet. On the internet. And you try to sell them light bulbs. Absolutely. Individuals or corporations? Both. [Patton] Both. That’s so fucking weird. [audience laughs] I just… I don’t know how… So you get on Zoom calls with them, and go, “Really quick, turn on all your lights.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“It’s pretty shitty, huh?” “Well, I’ve got a solution for you.” [laughing] [audience laughing] You’re not far. That’s so fucking interesting. Okay. You two are delightful, and you are not a superhero team. I’m sorry. [audience laughs] That is… I don’t know what the hell you are. There’s a guy who works at a Trader… Doesn’t quite know what he does there. Another guy gets on Zoom calls and sells light bulbs. I think you have a weird OnlyFans. You’re just covering for it now. You don’t really sell light bulbs. [man] It’s the DC Universe. Oh, DC Universe. Very… Oh… I’ll do the nerd shit, my friend. All right. [audience laughing] Don’t you dare! [audience laughing] That was a fun front row. Give them a round of applause. Thank you, guys. Wow. [cheering and applause] I love the flow of that. You know, doctor, lawyer, cybersecurity, educator, sort of groceries, light bulbs, I guess. I don’t know. [groans] [audience laughing] Perfectly paced. [kisses] [audience laughing] [sighs] You know what doesn’t age well? Woke. [audience laughs] It really doesn’t. I’m woke, I think. But you know what? I won’t be someday, and so will all of you.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBe woke. Be open-minded. Just don’t pat yourself on the back, ’cause it’ll bite you in the ass. Everyone getting cancelled now for not being woke was woke about something, they just couldn’t keep up with progress. Progress will always fucking steamroller you. I’m very pro-trans, very pro-gay marriage, gay rights, and pro-abor… No, no, no. No. No. [cheering and applause] That’s not… What I’m saying is that is going to blow up in my face someday. I’ll be doing comedy when I’m 70, and I will let slip something that I won’t be able to keep up with. I’ll be like, “I don’t think people should fuck their clones.” “Boo!” There’ll be some weird, like… [audience laughing] “No wait, I’m pro-trans.” “Fuck you, clone hater!” [audience laughing] “No, I’m totally progressive!” #Stopclonehate, then I gotta… Then I’ll double down. “When I grew up, you didn’t jerk off in a test tube and fuck whatever came out of it! If that makes me the bad guy, I’m sorry!”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Boo!” [Patton chuckles] By the way, that’s how you know if you’re a… uh, if you’re an oppressed minority, or, you know, a fringe group that used to be shit on, and now you know that you’ve made it when straight, white people start asking you if jokes are okay. That’s when you know… The trans community really broke through because all of a sudden, straight, white people’ll be like, “Is this okay?” “Does this joke work? Is that okay?” You know. But either way, that means in the future, straight, white people are gonna be the minority, then they’re gonna have assholes like, “Hey, I’m doing a joke about a straight, white dude, and, um, I have him bowling. Is that okay? You guys bowl, right? Like that’s…” [audience laughing] “It’s not offensive?” “He’s listening to Limp Bizkit, ‘ironically, ‘ okay?”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\n“It’s ironic. I’m doing it ironically.” [Patton chuckles] Goddamn, these last six years. Holy shit. I was in such a panic in 2016, then all the subsequent years, “What the hell’s going on? Oh my God. Is America coming to an end?” No. You know what? It isn’t. It’s bad right now, but everything that’s happening is supposed to be happening right now. Do you know what 2016 was? It was the boomers’ last temper tantrum.\\n[audience cheering]\\nThat’s what that was. [cheering and applause] The boomers’ last temper tantrum. Every time a generation gets old, they panic because death is scary and gross, and they put someone shitty in the White House before they go. This has happened before. The greatest generation… The greatest generation, oh my God, fought the Nazis, saved the world from tyranny, came back, built the suburbs, raised the baby boomers, then they started getting old. Hair turned gray, dick didn’t work anymore, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies. They panicked. Now it’s the late ’70s. Punk music, they don’t know what’s going on. “Fuck this.” “Put the old cowboy movie actor in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here, goddamn it!” [applause] Then the baby boomers grew up. Think of the baby boomers. They were on the cutting edge of sex, rock and roll, rebellion… They owned youth, and then they got fucking old. [audience laughing] And their hair got gray, and their dick stopped working, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies, fucking Gen X and Gen Z making fun of them on Twitter and TikTok. All this hip-hop music they don’t understand. Now they’re, “Oh my God, I’m about to die. What the fuck is going on?” “Put the racist game show host in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!” “I was here!” [laughter and applause] I’m Gen X. Well, our temper tantrum is going to be beyond ugly. [audience laughing] When we start getting old, our dicks stop working, our hair goes gray, God knows who we’re gonna put in the White House. It’s gonna be either Eddie Vedder or Janeane Garofalo. One of those two. I don’t know. [cheering and applause] Look. I love those guys. Janeane would be a horrible president. [audience laughs] I’ve known her since the ’90s. I love her. She would tell you that herself. Janeane, you should be president. “I’m not doing that shit.” Oh my God, wait a minute. That’s how she’ll win. [audience laughs] Think of how Gen X thinks. Like, “That’s exactly the attitude we need.” [audience laughs] That’s perfect. “No, I’m serious. I’m not doing it.” Yeah, we know, yes. [audience laughing] She’ll blow off a debate. She won’t campaign. She won’t show up to her own inauguration. Yes, that’ll be awesome. We’ll love her even more. CNN will have a ticker on the bottom of the screen, like, “Day 312 of the president not showing up.” [audience laughing] It’ll cut to her in some coffee shop. “I told you I wasn’t gonna run.” [audience laughing] And then we’ll die, and we won’t be here to see what Gen Z puts in the White House. President Logan Paul. I don’t… Look. I don’t know. [audience groaning] President Joe Rogan. [audience groaning] He would… People, listen to me. I’ve also… I’ve known Joe since the ’90s. He is a sweet guy. He has gone off the rails. You know why? ‘Cause someone gave him a hundred million dollars. [audience laughs] That would drive anybody… He’s actually handling it better than I would. [audience laughs] If I had a fucking podcast about knitting and someone gave me a hundred million, I would fuck yarn on my podcast! [audience laughing] And Joe would be like, “Patton went fucking nuts. Oh my God.” [Patton chuckles] Aging isn’t bad if you don’t take it personally. That’s the key, you know. Treat it like it’s a… Pretend you’re Jeff Goldblum in The Fly, and you’re watching all this weird shit happen. You’re like, “Oh my!” Get a leather-bound notebook. Take notes, you know, late at night, like… “Oh. My farts smell like old books.” “That’s… Hmm.” [audience laughing] “But I’m not eating old books. This…” “This calls for further examination.” [audience laughing] “Day 17. Takes longer to stop peeing than it does to pee.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s coming for all of us. I’m gonna leave you with this story about my, uh… Another breakdown that I had. Foot, all of it, it’s all coming apart. But you know what? We’re living in the 21st century and it’s okay. Always keep that in mind. Last year, last November, I had to have some minor surgery, right? And I’m gonna tell you the story. I’m gonna use a little AP English zhoosh to keep it from being horrifying, ’cause it is. I had to have some minor surgery, the kind of surgery that, um, I’ll put it this way, men my age who sit down a lot have to have. See where I’m going? So… And I’m worried. Still Covid. “Oh my God, what if I get an infection?” But I forgot I live in the 21st century. I have all these advantages in the plus column. On the day of the operation, I summoned a car with my phone. The car came. The guy was masked. I was masked. Car was clean, took me to the hospital. Doctor met me, showed me all the cleanliness protocols they had. He said, “This surgery, we’ve refined it.” “It only takes an hour. You’ll be out for an hour.” “You’ll go home today.” He put me under. I wake up an hour later. Oh my God, I’m fine. He goes, “You are fine.” “Here are some cutting-edge painkillers to help you with your recovery.” “You won’t feel a thing.” “Now take out your phone and summon another car.” “You live in the 21st century.” And I did, and the car took me home. And when I got home, I had a device onto which I could call, from the air, movies, books, television shows, music to entertain me while I recovered. Twenty-first century. When I left the hospital, the doctor said, “There’s a certain bodily function, that you’re used to doing every day.” “And for the next few days, you’re not gonna do it.” [audience laughs] “And then, after three or four days, all of a sudden, you will do it.” [audience laughing] “But the first time you do it, it will be doing you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“There’s no shame in it.” “It’s gonna happen, part of the recovery.” “Go heal in peace.” I go home. First day, I watch movies. I read books on my iPad. I go to sleep. Nothing happens. Next day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. Nothing happens. Third day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. 3:30 in the morning. [audience laughing] It happens. But I wake up as it’s happening and I can feel it coming. I’m half a second ahead of it. Oh my goodness, it’s not gonna be a disaster. I hop out of bed. Everything’s okay. I make it across the bedroom floor. I get into the bathroom. I’m ten feet away from the toilet. I’m gonna make it. [sings suspenseful melody] Boom! No.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI had managed to get my underwear and sweatpants off. [audience laughing] Which made things ten times worse. [audience laughing] Because now, our pristine white-tile bathroom… [audience laughing] …was decorated for autumn. How about that, huh? Yeah. [audience laughing] Happy Thanksgiving. So… [audience laughing] I’m standing there going, “Oh my God, I’ve got two choices. I can either clean myself off, or risk my wife coming in and seeing this disaster, which she doesn’t deserve.” So, I do the second choice. I clean up everything first. I get a bunch of towels. I get everything all cleaned up in a big, gross wad. I gotta take off all my clothes, including my shirt. I’d ruined my shirt. [audience laughing] Physics. So…\\n[audience laughing]\\nTake the whole wad down to the… And I’m nude now. Go down to the kitchen with this big wad of horror, take the bag out of the can, put this in the bag. Now, four in the morning, I gotta walk to the end of my driveway where the trash cans are. Get the thing open. Drop it. And I just stand there. [audience laughing] Nude. [audience laughing] 4:00 in the morning. And I just looked at the moon. [audience laughing] Like, hours ago, I was in the 21st century… [audience laughing] …with access to cutting-edge technology, medicine, transportation. And now, just a mere couple of hours later, I had been revealed as the naked ape I always was.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[applause]\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThe naked, shit-covered ape that’s inside all of us. And I actually had a weird moment of peace, ’cause it was so awful, and I’m just like, “You know what? I’m actually as far away from the 21st century as I could possibly be right now.” “I’m actually closer to my Neanderthal forebears.” “There’s something weirdly cleansing about this.” And I had that feeling for, like, ten seconds. That’s when I remembered all my neighbors have ring cameras on their doors.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo everybody got their Christmas card that year.\\nThank you so much, Denver!\\n[cheering and applause]\\nThank you!

londons royal court theatre acclaimed comedian ahir shah dishes on class family and multiculturalism in the uk from his grandfathers view\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nahir shah ends \\ngenre standup comedy social commentary\\ndirector peter orton\\nwriter ahir shah\\nstar ahir shah\\nin this standup comedy special ahir shah takes the audience on a personal and cultural journey reflecting on his british indian heritage and family history from childhood memories of watching goodness gracious me with his grandparents to dealing with societal changes class and multiculturalism in the uk shah blends humor and poignant storytelling the show covers themes of identity family sacrifice love and the generational impact of immigration all while maintaining his trademark wit and insightful social commentary\\n  \\n in january  a sevenyearold boy was sat on the floor of his grandparents’ living room in alperton north west london three generations gathered round the telly to watch episode one of this new show on the bbc now the boy’s grandparents had had tough lives right the sort of lives that clad you in an armour and it’s the sort of armour from which laughter struggles to escape but for the next half hour the boy and his family watched episode one of goodness gracious me and he listened as his grandparents fucking pissed themselves laughing at themselves and with themselves for the first time he could remember and watching sanjeev bhaskar meera syal nina wadia and kulvinder ghir on television the boy thought “wait we can do that i didn’t know we could do that” “but if we get to do that then i wanna do that” because hearing my grandparents make that sound is the best sound i’ve ever heard in my entire life over  years later would you please welcome to the stage mr ahir shah\\nhello hello\\nhello hello hello hello\\ngood evening london are we well\\n fantastic fantastic lovely to have you here lovely to have you in such fine voice hello uh my name is ahir shah that is my name by the way right i didn’t used to need to clarify this until a few years ago i was doing this gig in switzerland… i was doing a gig in switzerland and the theme of this gig was that every comedian was from a different country right i was the british entrant very modern\\nright and…\\n there was one comedian i was particularly excited to meet ’cause this guy’s name was ali al sayed now ali is a standup comedian from the united arab emirates of all places right i’d never met anyone from the united arab emirates let alone a comedian from the united arab emirates to be perfectly honest i didn’t think they had comedians in the united arab emirates i assumed he’d just be walking onstage being like “what’s the deal with unspeakable oil wealth”\\n\\nhe’s a very nice man a very funny man after the show all the comedians we’re all backstage hanging out we’re all having a laugh having a drink not ali obviously right and… we get to talking and he says to me “like uh listen bro” “we’re friends now i can ask you a question” “you’re not gonna get offended” i’m like “listen brother” “you’re from dubai i’m of south asian origin” “as long as the question you have for me is not ‘do you want a job on a construction site”\\n\\nindustrialised slavery “you can ask me whatever the hell you like” he’s like “nothing like that i was just wondering” “when did you decide to start using the hilarious comedy stage name ahir shah” right i was like “to be honest i don’t remember but it was probably h december  when i plopped out of mrs shah and she and mr shah decided to call their newborn bundle of joy ahir” “i think that’s about when i started going by ahir shah” he’s like “right right okay” “one thing you should know in case you’re ever in my neck of the woods is that in arabic your name means prostitute king”\\nhe wasn’t even fucking with me ahir shah is “prostitute king” in arabic there are several reasons i didn’t think my career would go stratospheric in saudi humble enough to know that i don’t have the best bonesaw material on the circuit that’s romesh and fair enough right but uh… i put this to the back of my mind for several years as you would until uh november  i was in egypt doing some work around the cop climate conference they speak arabic in egypt and i don’t know if anyone else in the room has ever walked into a hotel and attempted to check in by announcing themselves to everyone working there as “monarch of all pimps”\\nreally changes the vibe in a lobby in my experience they think you’re selling something very different to what you are anyway that’s me then ahir shah prostitute king to my friends mr shah to you and uh… it’s been a while since i’ve done a big show like this a lot’s changed in the world in my life a lot’s changed in my life i’m now very much in my thirties now that’s exciting shit started falling apart way younger than i was led to believe by the way i thought i had another good decade left in me as it stands everything’s already just crumbling my knees are already fucked absolutely no idea what’s going on there i’m trying desperately to get a referral from my gp right… sorry for younger people… right um a gp… right… so a gp was a service where like…\\nyoung fellow how old are you mate\\ntwentytwo twentytwo so you might remember but in the same way you remember ipods you never had one but you’re vaguely aware they existed okay so basically like a gp was this like… right imagine you’re a bit poorly not super poorly but a bit poorly what would happen was there was this number you called and someone answered right and uh… not even necessarily at eight in the morning any time during business hours very forthcoming uh so you’d call them and you’d be like “oh i’m a bit poorly” and they’d be like “ah cool come see us soon”\\nright and so a couple of days days a couple of days later what would happen was you went over to this… right it looked like a semidetached house it wasn’t that was the first trick they played it’s like a sphinx’s riddle past that you were golden you’d arrive like   minutes early you’re a conscientious person and you’d sit in a sort of uh waiting room and after about   minutes someone would call your name and you’d go to a separate smaller room and there would just be one guy in there and he would be like… i mean he would right ‘cause we’ve quite a reassuring manner in a lanyard right and you’d tell this person what sort of poorly that you were and this was a very welleducated person so you could just be fixed then and there but occasionally it’d be a slightly more complex health need and you’d get a referral to a hospital right sorry right a hospital now… have you ever wondered where the queue of ambulances ends right that is a building known as a “hospital”\\nfunny word isn’t it interesting thing you were born in one you’ll die in one between then you’re fucked sorry right uh basically that… i’m obviously being slightly disingenuous there are quite a lot of them generally speaking they were all either built or done up when the prime minister’s name was either attlee wilson or blair not sure why not sure why it’s just a coincidence isn’t it what possible intellectual merit could there be in examining why that might have ended up being the case of all things fourteen fucking years fourteen wasted fucking years like not entirely wasted obviously there have been some genuine achievements of conservative government i mean that entirely sincerely by the way my favourite of which is like… basically it’s funny if you ignore all of the noise and just look at the actual underlying data over the last  years the tories so successfully decarbonised the british economy and energy mix including all imported emissions that if the countries responsible for the lion’s share of emissions had been anything like as impressive as we’ve been over the last  years global warming basically wouldn’t be a thing the tories did that they did it on purpose it is spectacularly impressive and they can’t admit it ’cause they think it sounds gay other than that it’s slim pickings out there really is genuinely it’s worse than it’s been my entire adult life for sure listen the vibes are awful out there we’re genuinely skint as a collective in a way that we weren’t in  ’cause basically in  the conservatives were elected by telling a sequence of lies about the british economy and society that they then spent the next  years ensuring were true right and… is it… we need an election yeah we need an election at this stage i would settle for a total overthrow of the current system and the installation of oneman dictatorial rule provided that the man in question was martin lewis the money saving expert right\\n\\ni love that guy i love martin lewis the money saving expert so goddamn much\\ndo you sign up to his email\\noh yeah you do you’re a good citizen well done sir if you do not sign up for it do your bit for your country that man is the only thing standing between us and the fucking brink right i love martin lewis the money saving expert so goddamn… so for the uninitiated martin lewis he’s a moneysaving expert and he runs this website called moneysavingexpertcom and you get a weekly email and it’s about money saving and the expertise therein right and um basically martin lewis the money saving expert he set up his business for £ right eightzero that’s all it cost he is now worth  million right isn’t that amazing he gives a lot away to things like citizen’s advice ’cause he gives a shit unlike the people in charge i love that for martin lewis i love that martin lewis is rich right here’s the thing right the reason i love it is that martin lewis is basically the only person i can think of who’s got properly rich from helping do you know what i mean take a second to dwell on how rare that is broadly speaking ‘cause there’s no money in helping is there we all know that there’s money in hindering for sure right there’s no money in helping right when’s the last time any of you were walking down the street and went “oh my god a lamborghini who does that belong to” and someone’s like “the lollipop lady” right it doesn’t happen ‘cause there’s no money in helping unless you’re martin lewis because that man is rich as balls and the way he got there was by getting all of us together and just being like “pizza express 2 for 1 on wednesday” “dough balls are on me don’t worry about it”\\nit’s gonna take more than martin lewis to save us now the state that we’re in it’s really bad out there and it’s weird for me because at the same time as the country i love is so visibly on its knees i am personally happier than i have ever been in my entire life and the two things are entirely unconnected but still feeling personally happy when your country is suffering feels actively distasteful do you know what i mean i’ve not done it on purpose but it’s like having chumbawamba stuck in your head at a funeral the reason ladies and gentlemen that i am happier than i have ever been is that in october of last year i got married yeah honestly she’s the single best thing ever to happen to me i love her with all my heart she’s a civil servant i’m in it for the pension you have to understand i’m a selfemployed man before i met her my retirement plan was just to not live that long whereas now my entire financial security and old age is wholly dependent on not upsetting one woman till the day i die right that’ll be a new personal best mate in this economy i’ll try anything right i’d always known that i wanted to get married eventually i guess there was a certain degree of cultural expectation as well i don’t know what to tell you in asian families you get married you stay married it’s just what happens some of you may know this from your own families maybe friends’ families you might not be aware of the sheer extent to which this is the case so i’ll give you the best example i have i started doing standup comedy when i was a teenager right when i was about  years old i was given the opportunity to do five minutes at the hackney empire theatre in east london that’s a very big theatre  people some of you may well have been it’s the coolest thing that had ever happened to me i was on in the first section so i invited my mum my dad and my sister to come watch and they saved me a seat so i could watch in the second section and the reason i was invited in the first place is that the hackney empire were putting on an evening of british asian standup and i as the new kid on the block they were like “let’s give little ahir a go”\\nthat’s nice isn’t it and so the whole audience soldout show  people all british asian all of the performers british asian apart from… right… about two hours before the show started one of the acts suddenly had to drop out now this is the noughties it’s not like nowadays where everyone’s got email on their phones they had to ring around try and find a replacement a replacement was found in the form of my friend the comedian joe bor right now joe is a very nice man he’s a very funny man what joe is not is a british asian man right what joe is is a jewish man clearly with two hours on the clock one of the organisers was like “fuck i…”  “i think jews are basically asian i…”\\nlisten i’m not saying there aren’t similarities between the communities my best mate’s jewish we’ve been mates since we were  years old and it’s ’cause the first time we met he told me about his mum and everything that his mum did was either shit that my mum did or hadn’t thought of yet there’s one crucial difference between the communities as my friend the comedian joe bor found out to his dismay that evening because my friend the comedian joe bor walked onstage in front of  brown faces and opened with the line “my parents are divorced” “gimme a cheer if your parents are divorced”\\nfucking nothing not a single sound from  people i will never forget my mother leaning over and whispering in my earold ear “bless him he has no idea who he’s talking to”\\nso what happens in asian families for better or for worse you get married you stay married i come from a very long line of very longmarried people uh my parents met at a mutual friend’s birthday party in india in  fell in love at first sight my dad proposed that night they have been married for almost  years right um… by the standards of my mum’s family by the way my parents had had quite an extensive courtship uh prior to that i mean like well her parents my maternal grandparents nanaji and nanima i mean the first conversation they had with one another just like oneonone was on the night like several hours after they were already married right it’s  in india it was arranged i don’t know what to tell you like they weren’t complete strangers to one another that would be silly it’s like the families had exchanged a photograph uh… right and um… these pieces of paper with a few bits of biographical information on them imagine getting shown that when you’re like  \\n“is this who you’d like to marry forever”\\n“oh yeah i guess”\\nthen in the end very happily married for nearly a half century until my grandfather sadly died relatively young it’s so funny talking about this in front of liberal london audiences like it’s just like you all know that outwardly you have to be like “oh” “the mysteries of the east” uh… “a rich cultural tapestry that may be interwoven with our own”\\ninternally you’re all just thinking “that’s fucking barbaric”\\n“the thing is that’s fucking barbaric sorry” “you mean to tell me that two people barely out of their teens and all they had to go on was a photograph and a few bits of scant biographical information and within a matter of days they were in bed together” “that is fucking disgusting” “we would never do anything so crass and horrific in our contemporary enlightened western…”\\n\\nsorry just because you’ve decided to do it via algorithm not “old woman in your village” does not make it less arranged right all you’ve decided to do is outsource responsibility to the one thing somehow less accountable all right my wife and i obviously had a far more conventional relationship uh prior to getting engaged meeting in this country and whatnot it took me a long time to work up the courage to pop the question as they say mate we were going out five weeks and i asked her to marry me um… i get shit done there’s no point pissing about if you know you know so just get it… get it done no point leaving stuff on your todo list for six months things are worth doing quickly and well it’s the single best decision i ever made absolutely no downside admittedly we were engaged for six months before we could start living together just because like our tenancy agreements didn’t… spent half my life on a fucking bus then eventually obviously we were able to finally move in together but all that meant was we were two people in our early thirties living in london joining households so now we rent one roof that contains two copies of every ottolenghi book and no realistic pathway to homeownership  i love my ottolenghi books though not giving those up even for a house might need the spares love my ottolenghi books hey mate you got an ottolenghi book\\nah yeah i love it\\nyeah that’s the sort of thing you can afford when you get the martin lewis email love my ottolenghi books\\n“for this recipe you will need two limes that were once briefly glimpsed by a persian widow”\\n“or if they don’t have that in a shop near you just any lime”\\nthe thing is you think it’s bullshit but i got some of the widow limes and you can taste the grief it’s good stuff actually the salt from the tears adds real depth of flavour i think that shy of having children with someone i think getting engaged getting married it’s like the most optimistic bet that two people can make on the future just this idea that you can sincerely look at someone and say “our lives could be joined in something greater than the sum of its parts stretching forward for the rest of them”\\nthat’s an extraordinarily optimistic way to feel right at the same time as it feels like we’re embarking on the most optimistic journey of a lifetime it feels like the country around us has just given up you know what i mean it’s very difficult not to feel like this entire place has called last orders isn’t it it is acutely difficult not to feel deeply pessimistic about every element of the future of this country right that’s weird enough for me as we’re beginning this optimistic journey but it’s doubly weird when i think about the fact that if i were able to get into a time machine and travel to  when my grandfather younger than i am now became the first member of our family to set foot on these shores and i would just explain the present to him he would not believe me because he would think i was describing some unimaginable utopia of progress so that’s really what i’m trying to do to take a step back view things through a wider lens a generational lens get some perspective not be so blinkered try not to lose the wood for the trees ‘cause the story of my family is a very typical one for the british indian community i think that’s a very relevant story to the past present and future of this country right british indians are by a very long margin the largest minorityethnic group in this country hindus again we’re talking about millions upon millions… none of you know any of that because our entire cultural output consists of my mate nish right and… the story of the indian community in this country by and large starts as it did for my family in the  and has ended up in the  with us now running everything\\n“rishi bhai did it”\\n“rishi bhai did it never thought i’d live to see the day that rishi bhai did it”\\n“got that big house in the middle of town now baby”\\n“rishi bhai did it”\\nlisten politically i’m furious racially thrilled ah are you kidding me on an ethnic level couldn’t be happier for him and his family increasingly worried about mine very much how i used to feel every time i saw suella aunty on the television “jesus christ calm down suella aunty you’re gonna get us both killed”\\nright uh… i’m gonna talk about the prime minister a little bit obviously i’ve got to be relatively careful what i say about him because we can all agree there’s about a  chance that a decade from now i will play him in a channel 4 drama right right… not gonna burn a bridge before i’ve even crossed it are you kidding me i need that money i just wish that i could get across like how wild that day was right i… a british indian devout hindu son of immigrants became prime minister of britain on diwali that was a very difficult day in the family whatsapp for me get the family whatsapp up on my phone yes it’s called the asian network see “dad is typing…” wait for the inevitable “ahir have you seen what mr sunak’s son has done today” “still ahir you enjoy mocking your week i’m sure that’s nice for you”\\ni’m glad the shine’s come off him now everyone knows he’s not really up to it at the beginning you all acted like he was the perfect indian boy at the beginning everyone acted like he was the perfect indian boy it’s ’cause you just go off the cv on paper right you don’t know what i know what does it say on the cv fucking anyone could’ve done that what piece of piss who cares what all right fair enough what’s the guy done fair enough does well at school gets into oxford does well at oxford gets into stanford does well at stanford starts working in finance becomes a multimultimillionaire in his own right in his twenties largely through executing positions as a big short in  that makes him rich enough that he’d never have to work again no one even reflects on that ’cause at stanford he meets and eventually marries the daughter of a genuine indian billionaire who’s a very successful businesswoman in her own right they move to the united kingdom where he becomes an mp at an obscenely young age chancellor at an obscenely young age during one of the worst financial crises this country’s experienced then prime minister at an obscenely young age of the country that colonised and expropriated the wealth of his ancestors leading to complex migratory patterns in his family’s case via east africa landing him on the doorstep of the most significant address in this country on the most significant day of his faith and everyone acts like he’s the perfect indian boy feel free to look this up it is genuinely true rishi sunak never made his school cricket team i was captain of mine\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat’s right that is right any indian father would dropkick the prime minister into a canal to get me all right know what i mean\\n“who cares about rishi sunak i want ahir tendulkar mmm”\\n“hearing a lot about number ten should be batting at number four”\\n“that’s classy”\\nhis family came here in the ’ too like i… i think about that sometimes getting into my time machine and travelling to that cold bedsit in bradford and explaining to my grandfather that when his grandson was a bit older than he was then not only would this be the case but i think the bit that he’d struggle with the most is that it’s not a thing do you know what i mean the news was just like “and the prime minister rishi sunak” and everyone’s like “yeah that makes sense”\\nit is remarkable how unremarkable it is right that’s a thing that’s worth reflecting upon listen i’ll always talk about the things we do badly as a country i think one of the things we do terribly as a country is never discussing anything we do well as a country and i do think that when we’re at our best britain stands basically alone certainly in europe probably in the world as an example of what a properly successful multiethnic multicultural democracy can look like in practice in the t century that’s something that is worth discussing it’s why i hate it when you get people on the far right decrying that multiculturalism is some grand failed experiment when you can see its successes if you bother to open your eyes it’s why i can’t stand it when people on my own “team” right i don’t like teams in the first place but listen i voted remain but whenever people are like “it was only the european union that gave us our values of tolerance and decency to…”\\nfuck off anyone else in the room ever been to continental europe while not white it’s not the relaxing holidaying experience that some of the rest of you may enjoy genuinely a couple of years ago i had to go to this wedding in france i genuinely… the way people were… i kept asking people i was with… like i thought i had something on me turns out i did gonna get an algerian president of france anytime soon or reckon the fash’ll get there first same question for germany you know listen i think that britain stands basically alone in this that’s worth reflecting on right i remember when i was  years old walking across the meadows on the south side of edinburgh with my friend the indian american comedian hari kondabolu right i said to him “hari bhai…“\\ni think that when you’re part of any sort of visible minority whatever that minority might be what you fundamentally want in life it’s not necessarily different treatment or special treatment rather it is the ability eventually to get to go without saying to be part of what is just to sort of get to be normal i think if you get to be normal  you probably don’t realise how cool it is to get to be normal all the time and does political representation get us there in and of itself of course it doesn’t right we know this for a fact rishi sunak not even the first pm from a minorityethnic background first way back in the h century benjamin disraeli also a tory right would you say that antisemitism does not exist in contemporary britain that would be a fucking stupid thing to say but maybe these things are indicative of the fact that in societies we can over time move towards a position where more and more people can be brought into the circle of who gets to go without saying until that sphere is eventually expanded to include everyone which is where it should’ve been in the first fuckin’ place i have had the very great privilege of seeing a large amount of this world through these eyes i have been to many countries cities continents doing this and i can comfortably say that britain is yes as the cliché goes “the least racist country in the world”\\nit just says a shitload more about the world than about britain right and please do not interpret this as any sort of grand political point i think the guy’s a fucking appalling prime minister he’s like genuinely terrible and no one voted for any of this it is abysmal what is happening to us at the moment i do not agree with his politics but… by the way that’s when you know that something historic’s happened people use phrases like “i may not agree with the politics but…”  no one felt the need with david cameron it’s just nice for someone like that to get a girl isn’t it right but sunak and cameron are basically the same guy ’cause they went to fancy school that’s what explains it fancy school and fancy school runs the country that is not the school that i think about when i think about the prime minister the school that i think about is quite a long time ago and quite a long way away in april  an event occurred in amritsar punjab at the time british india that is now known to history as the jallianwala bagh massacre also known as the amritsar massacre this is when thousands of entirely unarmed civilians peaceful protesters and pilgrims were kettled into a very very small area and tens of thousands of rounds of machinegun fire were opened up intentionally on these entirely unarmed civilians at least  of whom were murdered probably many more though we’ll never know the true total and thousands more had lifedefining injuries thereafter it is one of the worst and most welldocumented cases of colonial atrocities of british rule in india i’ve known about that a very long time what i did not know about until an investigation in the times last year was that subsequent to the massacre in amritsar there was a sequence of additional smaller massacres perpetrated in towns and villages surrounding amritsar as the word got out in order to stop the possibility of any subsequent civilian uprisings including one that happened in a place called gujranwala right now gujranwala it’s about  miles away from amritsar it’s a border town in contemporary pakistan and in gujranwala again thousands of rounds of machinegun fire were let out at entirely unarmed… just farmers tilling their fields and over the course of two days ten bombs were dropped including one intentionally dropped on the school as a show of “this is how powerful we are and how little of a shit we give about you so don’t you even think about trying to fuck with us”\\none of the survivors of the massacre in gujranwala was a twoyearold boy named ramdas ramdas’s grandson is at time of recording prime minister of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland\\nyeah\\n when… when i think about the last century of world history and what might prove possible over time and generations i think about the school in gujranwala rather more than i think about winchester college a punchline would feel distasteful\\n\\nright obviously i wasn’t alive at the time but i reckon the way i feel’s basically how a lot of women felt about margaret thatcher in  you don’t need to agree with someone’s politics in order to acknowledge that someone walking through the door means something in and of itself and that’s the only way you pave the pathway for others to follow and you can’t deny that it works you can’t deny that it… listen we’ve now had enough whitelady prime ministers that they’re allowed to be instantly shit that is a staggering achievement for equality in this country are you kidding me maggie and theresa walked so liz could fly liz truss actually very important from a representational standpoint as well uh i mean that entirely sincerely too think about how many prime ministers there must’ve been over however long it’s been did you know that liz truss is the first who just went to a regular comprehensive school isn’t that mad right like  of children go to a regular comprehensive school i went to a regular comprehensive school i believe  of prime ministers should go to a regular comprehensive school admittedly she wasn’t a great advert for us right “i may not agree with her politics but…”\\nin case you’re trying to square the circle of the educational background and the accent you’re currently enjoying… uh well uh… what ended up happening there was i went to my local comp in wembley north west london i had a wonderful time there but it did have a few police vans outside to stop us murdering each other very thoughtful of them subsequent to that i ended up going to the university of cambridge so i became functionally bilingual in both posh boy and roadman uh uh… a few years ago i was doing a tv record in glasgow and afterwards i was having a cigarette with my friend the comedian jamali maddix i was there with jamali smoking making small talk\\nhe went “you went private school yeah” i’m like “oh no i didn’t” “what”\\nso i talked him through a few basic facts about my childhood and he just looked at me and went “hang on bruv are you from ends”\\n “well jamali one supposes one was”\\ni’m not gonna do it down i grew up in a wonderful place i went to a wonderful school i hate when people do that down i… genuinely it was a really good school if you avoided gang violence cousin marriage it was ofsted good like it was a great environment all the families by and large like mine first secondgeneration immigrants parents may not have had a lot to give what they had was the most important an insistence that education is the best way onward upward outward i think if you’ve got  grand that’s a better thing to give to a child and blessed with really great teachers i’ll tell you about one of my favourites miss lewis now miss lewis i think she had previously taught at a private school i don’t know but she definitely knew the extras they were given in order to get ahead maybe thought that was unfair right and so she set up off her own initiative like all great teachers do off her own bat she set up for a couple of years an additional optional latin class of all things and i as you can probably imagine was heavily involved this is what i mean about the transformative power of education you could change everything for young people in an instant i still remember like it was yesterday the first time i walked into that gleaming portakabin bestowed on us by new labour and i sat down and i opened these textbooks that contained these things that i’d never even conceived of before i was just there being like “oh my god it’s true” “caecilius est in horto”\\ndo you know what i mean right led to probably my single favourite experience of my entire time at high school which was one time at the end of term my boys and i were gonna go cinema ’cause you get a half day the way that you go to the cinema you get the  from brent town hall so we were walking to the bus stop and on the way to the bus stop there’s this blind alley right and a dozen guys came out to rush us and jack us and shit until one of them just stopped all of the others by going “guys ahir’s safe yeah i know him from latin”\\ni sincerely believe i am the only man in the long history of this sceptred isle who has ever avoided a violent mugging because of latin class uh…  nathaniel gratias tibi it’s a great environment to grow up in you know not much cash but a lot of ambition i think that’s a good way around to have it generally speaking and realistic ambition as well the families just had realistic ambitions the sort of ambition every parent should be able to rely on the idea that if everyone does their bit works hard the next generation might have it a bit easier than the previous one did that is a reasonable ambition parents should be able to rely on that coming true for their children right now this is not an unreasonable ambition i know all about unreasonable ambition you don’t need to tell me about… i remember once when i was at uni entirely unironically telling my mate ali that by the time i was in my thirties i wanted to be gq magazine’s world’s best dressed man right i am now in my thirties and will settle for “dressed man”\\n and that’s a stretch most days listen we all know fundamentally that any sort of vision of progress has to take into account generational investment i think that the part that we’ve forgotten is that the flip side of that coin has always been generational sacrifice now i might not know much about generational investment yet but i feel like through example i at least know something about generational sacrifice because every day after primary school i would go to my grandparents’ house in alperton north west london and i would see generational sacrifice continuing to write itself on the faces of nanaji and nanima now quick note on language i speak another language it’s called gujarati “nanaji” just means your mum’s dad you have different words for both sides of the family so maternal grandfather that’s nanaji as you can imagine i write a lot of stuff on my computer my computer refuses to accept the existence of the word “nanaji” and will insist on autocorrecting it every time to the word “navajo” which has led to three instances where i alone at home have yelled at a computer screen “wrong sort of indian”\\nnow nanaji was the first member of my family to arrive in this country when he was in his twenties in  he is probably the reason that i was born here in the first place he is the reason for so much even though he died a fair while ago now he’s probably the largest part of the reason why i ended up sounding like this right when he was eventually reunited with his wife and children in this country he said to the children including my mother “listen when you’re outside you’re not allowed to speak to one another in gujarati any more” “you live somewhere called england now so you need to learn how to speak like proper little englishmen and women” “and then if you learn how to do that maybe one day they’ll learn how to accept you”\\nand it sounds kind of weird to our contemporary ears but this was a very commonplace thing in the ’ and ’ a sort of like vocal version of dressing for the job you want you ever heard that phrase right and this has been entirely useless for me but like my uncle is a doctor can you imagine if your doctor looked and sounded like me you’d be fucking thrilled imagine that he’s doing the ward rounds just like “oh good morning how are we feeling today” you’re thinking “this motherfucker’s gonna cure me in two hours” “make lunch plans”\\nnow nanaji could never integrate in that way himself so i think that his way of doing it was that he worked a succession of almost comically english jobs right so for the most part of his career until he retired he worked at john lewis worked on the shop floor selling curtains fabrics ’cause it’s what he knew from the textile factories back in india that’s probably the most english place anyone could possibly work you’re not gonna get a more english place to work than the john lewis partnership unless the job you had before that was conductor on the big red bus “fair play that’s the most english place anyone could possibly work” “you can’t hit us with a more english workplace than the big red bus”\\nunless the first job you had in this country was literally at the bakedbean factory it’s where it all started bakedbean factory in bradford  baby came over here work on those beans now uh crucially he did not want to uh right by that stage been married for just under a decade had three children had friends enjoyed his work in the textile factory thought he might be able to work his way up and everything very little interest in the united kingdom hitherto no interest in beans right but um… it was my grandmother who pushed this like nani quite understandably was like “listen just…” india at the time is just poorer and more violent than anyone with the dumb luck of having been born in this country can remotely conceive of and so she quite understandably was like “listen these children aren’t gonna have the life we wanna give them over here but they’re taking people in england” “so i need you to go over there you just work it out right” “i’ll stay here with the children you send money back to us” “when you’ve saved up enough we’ll come join you” “all right cool see you later bye”\\nuh… he just did it like pretty soon thereafter just went… like listen i like to think that i’m gonna be a pretty sort of accepting thoughtful  type of husband right however if just under a decade from now my wife is to tell me that i must leave her and our three children to move to a different continent with no guarantee of when i would see them again no way of communicating with them no guarantee if any of it was going to work out and no guarantee of my own personal safety that would not be the end of the conversation right however of course for nanaji it was how could it not be that’s your dharma that’s your duty you have to do it it’s your duty to your family right so he came over not entirely on his own came with a couple of other guys who did the same left the wives and kids but they didn’t really see each other that much for a few years ’cause they ran a system called the eighteighteight right the eighteighteight is a system whereby as mathematicians in the room can confirm if three men each have two jobs the shifts of which are eight hours long and you time the shift patterns correctly and work seven days a week you only need to rent one bed in one room because one of you can be asleep at any given time while the other two are at work one guy finishes his second shift comes back hits you awake you go off to your first one he falls asleep do that again and again saves twothirds on the rent that’s more that you can send to the wives and kids in india and that’s the largest expense isn’t it what’s the secondlargest expense probably food but food taken care of ‘cause at the bakedbean factory they give you a tin of beans protein very important for the second meal of the day they had a big sack of rice and they’d have some boiled rice in a pot apart from sundays obviously because sunday is treat day so the boiled rice contained an onion right some of you are probably thinking “surely even in  onions are cheap” “anyone could have onions whenever they wanted”\\nfrom what you have heard so far about my nanima do you believe she is the sort of woman who would have tolerated the profligacy of a sevenaweek onion habit it’s what you needed to do it’s what they needed you to do so it’s what you did eighteighteight   five five years he didn’t see his wife or children for five years imagine that it’s not like “at least i’ve got a good data plan” or something like that forget about calling that was never gonna happen letters couple of letters a year each time you write one you feel a bit closer every time you buy a stamp you’re driving them further away to the extent that my mum’s first memory in this country is heathrow airport  her her brother and sister all sort of hid behind their mum because they were just like “who’s this man” right “who’s this big man” right just like “why’s he smiling at me” “why’s he got these tears in his eyes” “i guess he looks like that photograph that mummy cries over sometimes if anyone ever hums that song you know”\\ni think about that a lot too right imagine that trying to raise three children on your own for five years occasionally just crying over a single photograph and a handful of letters should’ve cried over a lime she’d have made some money family reunited in  the year after a very prominent conservative politician got on a soapbox in birmingham and said “we must be mad literally mad to be permitting the annual inflow of dependents who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrantdescended population” “it is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre” now mr powell was correct about one thing in that that little girl hidden behind the sari did become part of the material of the future growth of the immigrantdescended population because that’s quite a mouthful my sister and i tend to go with “mum”\\nimagine that bringing your wife and kids into that the year after rivers of blood when you’ve been here on your own since ’ the same year as the smethwick campaign right it’s fucking grim right just like the violence the aggression that goes without saying it’s also… it’s always the more insidious stuff that cuts the deepest yeah the thing i suppose like nowadays we acknowledge as having broken him was that he was eventually uh accused of quite serious theft from the workplace uh which was like… suspended and investigated for ages entirely cleared he’d obviously not done it but it didn’t take a genius to work out eventually when you hear these stories that it all starts with a couple of guys at the place being like “who do you reckon they’re gonna believe eh”\\nimagine what that does to you like your dignity and stuff you have to do it again though tomorrow you have to get up brave face for the kids for the kids it’s not like the kids have it any easier there has been so much more progress in the last  years in this country than there was in the  that preceded it and i feel very comfortable saying that because i went to exactly the same high school as my mum and my uncle my abiding memory of that school is a funny story about the time when i didn’t get mugged ’cause of latin hahaha my uncle’s abiding memory of that school is the people who would flick lit cigarettes at him every day when he walked to and from it my mum’s abiding memory of that school sticks with her to this day because every time she wants to eat something she has to change her clothes entirely cook eat change her clothes entirely again no matter how many times i tell her that the smell of spices hitting hot oil is the most beautiful smell in the world all she hears is a decade of children telling her how much she stank and he died in  so he died only remembering the shit bit and he wasn’t old so if he’d just hung on he would have seen how quickly it was going to get so different you could have at least seen a bit of that before you left right in  i’m on a train reading a newspaper sorry mate a newspaper right um… imagine like a solid tweet right and… and… on a train reading a newspaper and it’s the day before the mayoral election in london and there’s this big feature article uh where basically sadiq uncle is walking around the city meeting the various voters and talking to them in the feature there’s this one guy i’ve forgotten his name it was a west african name i think he’s there with his fiveyearold son and he says to him “son i want you to shake this man’s hand” “this is mr khan” “mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london”\\nand in that moment of reading that like my hands stopped working and the paper fell from my hands and the tears fell from my eyes as i thought about the fact that he died in a society where the sentence “this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london” was completely impossible right and yet  years later it had become totally inevitable so what would he have made of witnessing the change in society necessary to make that happen and landing on that sentence in that paper what would he have made of reading a sentence like that what would he have made of reading the words “this is mr khan mr khan is going to be the next mayor of london” probably not much i don’t think he really liked muslims “i may not agree with his politics but…” and that’s how i felt diwali before last you know lit my divo i went outside i went back into the kitchen and i poured a little glass of whisky and i said “you finding today interesting eh”\\nit’s like obviously problems still exist none of this is to negate any of the problems that we’re all too aware of right but at the same time pretending that the sort of stuff that i have and have had to contend with is in any way comparable to the sort of things that they had to deal with feels genuinely offensive to me ‘cause this was the generation that never talked about it and so never had it acknowledged and it’s worth acknowledging ‘cause they’re the ones who changed so much to make so much of what happens now possible right i’m not an idiot i wander around doing this for a living all around the country occasionally people shout ignorant shit at me in the street like i’m not oblivious to that and listen my wife is a white irish lady sometimes the two of us are going about our business out and about and people see us together they don’t like that too much they make their opinions known they’re all so fuckin’ old right so old like proper fossils and… when i was a teenager it would really… like i’d be ready to fight and now a part of my brain just can’t help but think “f… i think maybe you lost” right no not… lost isn’t correct ’cause it’s not like society’s a football match where someone blows the whistle and we decide what the result’s been but at the very least i can acknowledge that i’m not the one who scored the goals i’m a sub they’re the ones who scored the goals they scored the goals and ran straight back to the net and pulled it back to the halfway line ’cause they knew that no matter how hard they were trying every single day they were still  two down right and is the point of my generation one more not only of maintenance but also trying not to lose grip on this extraordinarily fragile thing that exists around us it’s worth acknowledging how fragile this thing is right because you see people young people trying once again to sow sort of any sorts of division in this society we’re trying to build and you just think “what the fuck are you doing” “what are you doing”\\nsurely the point… if the point is anything the point is to create a society in which one day everyone’s children get to go without saying i think that you have to be staggeringly naive to believe that that’s possible and i refuse to be anything else it’s so easy to despair right despair is the easiest position to have it’s definitely my default it just turns out that despair is a deeply unproductive emotion right try something else yeah my wife’s way better than me at this like she’s just generally speaking quite stable and well adjusted i used to think that she was some sort of superhero or something turned out it’s because she has absolutely no socialmedia presence whatsoever uses the internet sparingly if necessary for work if we were all slightly more like her we’d all be slightly less fucking insane by the way no one’s changed their names there’s no mrs shah to this story fortunately for all of us in irish her name means “prostitute queen”\\ndidn’t even take five weeks not really there was a point one week stood opposite her in the kitchen and just all of a sudden it’s like the trailers stopped like all life up to that point had revealed itself to be the trailers and all of a sudden every atom of the world outside of the two of us was whispering in unison “shhshhshhshhshhshhshh shh”  “the picture’s about to start” and now i get to see how it goes that’s it i mean the ending’s gonna suck right i’m not gonna know too much about it though  gonna die first get in love it are you kidding me listen it’s like… she’s really like “oh no we shouldn’t have processed food in the house” and all i want to do in my life is fuck a chicago town pizza while chainsmoking and doing lines of salt it’s nice to feel like you’ve had one of your last beginnings yeah frees you up to think about where things end up it’s the interesting thing with love right love the way that it begins begins in as many ways as there are people if we were ever to have a conversation and you said to me “ahir can i just check were you in love on your wedding day”\\nwouldn’t that be a ridiculous question you’d never ask ‘cause the answer’s obviously yes right what i find fascinating is that if you were ever to meet my grandmother and you were to say “ramila can i check on your wedding day were you in love”\\nit would be an equally ridiculous question ’cause the answer would obviously be no of course she wasn’t right there she was little more than a girl sat opposite little more than a boy total strangers functionally of course she didn’t love that boy right and yet it began it began right wild did she love the boy she was sat opposite on her wedding day of course she didn’t right did she love the young man just under a decade later who was willing to move continents because he knew that’s what the people who relied on him needed from him in that moment of course she loved that man she loved that man for the next five years as she held up her end looking after three children while occasionally taking a moment to cry over a photograph and a handful of letters of course she loved that man she loved that man in heathrow airport  the photograph made flesh once more as those three children hid behind her sari because they barely recognised the man who had done so much for them of course she loved that man she loved that man as she took his hand and walked forward together into a society infinitely more hostile than the one that has been bequeathed to me as a direct result of their actions she loved that man as they danced together shielding one another from as many slings and arrows as humanly possible for the next decades until his end she loved that man she loved that man in  and well past that as you will know if you go to a living room in alperton north west london and see a photograph on the wall with a fresh garland of flowers that you pray to when you visit of course she loves that man that’s where it ends up nanaji died in  a week after his birthday he’d just turned  oi  he’d brought a slightly hastened end onto himself really uh… basically when he retired he wanted to spend as much time in india as humanly possible but his lungs had been fucked since his twenties ’cause of the fibres in the air in the textile mills the place in india my family are historically from a city called ahmedabad it’s incredibly polluted makes central london look like the fucking peak district and so he would go over there and come back weaker diminished and he came back and after the second trip his grownup children had to get him sat down in his own living room and my mum had to say to her own dad “you are killing yourself” right “that’s what’s happening here that’s what’s… it’s perfectly clear”\\n“you go there you come back you’re weaker you’re smaller”\\n“you’re more diminished”\\n“and can you not see what is happening to you”\\n“it’s not even about seeing akshay is a doctor”\\n“he can hear what is happening based on your breath and diagnose you”\\n“do you not feel what is happening”\\n“so here’s the thing you’ve had your fun you’ve had two trips”\\n“but now you stay over here right”\\n” ‘cause we love you very much so we wanna keep you around”\\n“that’s how we’re all gonna look after one another”\\n“so you’ve had your fun but you’re not allowed to go any more”\\n“here you are good yes”\\nand he had to look at three adult children and say “no”\\n\\n\\n\\n“i never wanted any of this right i never wanted any…”\\n“like my entire life it turns out has just been this means to an end and that’s fine it’s fine because you are the end”\\n“so if i had to do it again i would with a snap of the fingers and a smile on my face i would do it again”\\n“but can you not understand that i just need this at my end”\\n“i can feel it far more than you can see it or he can hear it”\\n“do you not understand i don’t care”\\n“i don’t care because when i go over there no one looks at me like i’m any different or yells at me or spits at me like i’m any different because i’m not any different”\\n“when i go over there i am a normal guy”\\n“i have been a normal guy since the day i was born”\\n“i just haven’t felt like it in so long”\\n“you don’t understand that when i’m over there i get to go without saying and i haven’t gone without saying since nineteen sixtyfuckingfour”\\nhe used to run off the plane as quickly as possible sprint across the tarmac as quick as fucked lungs would carry him and go to the first part of the airport that wasn’t paved over fall to his knees and just start digging fistfuls of earth with his bare hands he would dig up the earth and he would put it in his mouth can you imagine dig the earth and put… ‘cause you miss a land so much that you need to dig it and put it in your mouth but you had to leave you had to leave because that’s what they needed and if they needed it it’s what you had to do he would dig the earth and put it in his mouth it can’t have helped\\n\\na third and final trip to the only place on the face of this earth that would do a normal guy the basic decency of getting to go without saying and it killed him that’s how much every human being wants that you need a pretty damn good reason not to give it to them when he did die he died in this country in a hospital d’you remember “hospital”\\nand my mother was next to him sat down he was in a bed not speaking any more it was just the beeps you know most of us have heard the beeps and a nurse came by saw my mum and said “oh you must be mr vaishnaw’s daughter” she said “yes i am” and the nurse said “well listen i’m new to the ward so i didn’t get a chance to speak to him but i’ve spoken to some of the other nurses who did and they said he was a good man”\\nand my mother squeezed the hand of a man she had barely recognised in heathrow airport in  and said “he was the best of men” and the line went flat and if nanaji were capable of hearing in that moment then the very last thing he heard on this earth was the little girl it had all been for saying that he was the best of men and like objectively he wasn’t\\n\\ndo you know what i mean not a baddie but just you know a normal complex flawed human being like absolutely everyone in this room and probably we could give one another a bit more of a break than we currently have the appetite for i suppose yeah but for someone for someone which it turns out is the only way that you can be of course he was he was the best of people for someone he did what they needed from him when they needed it from him he did the best that he could for the people he loved if you can do that then you can be the best of people for someone if you can do the best you can for the people you love and who rely on you then you damn well get to go without saying in my book it is not that i have currently had some sort of grand revelation that sacrifice is somehow more impressive or important than achievement the truth is what the truth always was in the first place which is that the sacrifice is the achievement and with that in mind i know full well that till my end krishnadas vaishnaw will remain the most impressive man i will ever meet i have wanted to do this since january  sat on the floor of my grandparents’ living room in alperton north west london listening to nanaji and nanima laugh at episode one of goodness gracious me and for just over a decade i have had the absurd privilege of calling it my career but it’s not the job not any more and it never will be again i hope the job as i understand it is what nanaji understood the job to be he was a good husband and a good father for the people who needed him to be when they needed him to be he was the best of men and i am now in front of you the world’s best dressed man  because i get to stand in front of you and tell his story while wearing his waistcoat because i am finally dressed for the job i want and it will be the hardest job of a lifetime\\n but with you nanaji i’ll be able to do it i hope sorry “hope…”\\n\\n\\nthank you very much\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmore\\n\\nahir shah standup transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshare this article \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

gentlemen please welcome to the stage ali wonghi hello welcome thank you thank you for coming hello hello we are gonna have to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in like ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for comingum its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that uh i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an earold girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because earold girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating throughand then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find outum i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like you never know when you might need this and i was like but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of successi grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh hes– hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was like oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had we had so much chemistry he was like hey wassup i was like wassup and we– the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like hey can you drop me off i was like where he was like at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like oh no i just fucked a homeless dude againmy husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude you know you feel like youre in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and its very you know its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement you know just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im like i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer you knowbut i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on you knowmy last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its like making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre like i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes fromi think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was like its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abusedi grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats like a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were like oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier 1 imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the househim and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre like im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always like oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i waspeople are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you– like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be like we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre like but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn ita lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be like look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im like that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retiredi do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day like youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre like oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they wantyou know its– its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was like you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit togethermy fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was like why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just lets redecoratei gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a– im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to youi broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like uh youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really you know freaked out about anal and theyre like oh i dont wanna do that im scared of– of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre– if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel like youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like oh my god its like im going back in time♪ a whole new world ♪it was magicala big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your– just give your man a little– a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont– no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye like hes discovered nirvana and its like youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you knowmy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when– when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right im like yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their– glasses always means the woman wants some– its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just– just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do itsheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cuntim just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that box whole foods mango

asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteranso i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres– none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be like guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become– youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was like yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won you knowanother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was like yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and you know why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were like yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im like oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here you knowi need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre like im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their– their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevityi also decided to have a kid because uh im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it– and it scared me like im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im– im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats– thats shit you do in your  ok when in– when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um yeah and most of the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom– shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was like no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was like yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyoncé he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though im– im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you– that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channeli can already see how theres like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommyyou know i– i– i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big– they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing itnow that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my– my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporinso you know i– i in– previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months

everybody go i thought i was a good boy hes just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat i dont understand i dont understand why a group like glaad right i always forget its gay lesbian a whatever the fuck it stands for all right why do they go after the old guy in the boat why dont they go after the people writing the book right hey could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages theyre not gonna do that thats the vatican theyre their own city they got a wall around their own city theyre brushing off cases of pedophilia like its nothing theyre not taking that call oh what happened really go fuck yourself click they dont carei learned a long time ago i think whatever youre into youre into but im not into that religious stuff where– and this is why i actually walked away from my religion i had to be honest with myself one i didnt like to go– i didnt like going to church every week you know i just didnt part of it was im lazy i dont like getting up on sundays and the other part was i already heard all the stories okay heard them three four times the dude hasnt come back yet you know were just sort of mulching over the same shit here i got it – right –and the other aspect was you know i actually– i had to be honest with myself i felt my religion made sense and everybody elses sounded stupidi did look im not talking about the basis of every religion basis of every religion makes sense you know the ten commandments dont kill anybody dont touch my wife thats my bike right that all makes sense of which ive broken i think ive broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one thats it i havent killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and theyre wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh shh shh right see the whole thing so well see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where were going and what happens after we die everybody elses religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles theres a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my lifeyeah like your guys name is ron ron and he wasnt alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like years ago he had a drivers license social security number theres like footage of him stubbing his toe motherfucker right i know what happened he was working at dennys he got sick of it ill start a religion hey everybody theres this spaceship coming back everybodys getting sneakers this is tom cruise were gonna try to make you clear right look im paraphrasing im paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but thats essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so yeah that made total sense to me so it just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesnt you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we– right we got the space shuttle you know theres sneakers theres a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think its cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldnt there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right ah son there is no fat fuck its your mother and i your moms the tooth fairy rabbits dont have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams wont come true right and i was just like wow this is how the world is and meanwhile this shit was just floating this ound gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person thats very offensive to me and other christians and become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just yeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i dont go anymore or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let gojust let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think hes along for the ride the two of them theyre a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking that rock just keeps going this dude just stops thats what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didnt read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it and on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures i just floated awayso now its like im in this weird place where im not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you knowid like to believe in something so ive been going around asking people what their shit is and i havent been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there theyre like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die youre dead and thats it dead like a pigeon just– just layin there over blew my mind im like really youre just dead like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged right god pops in the dvd of your life well i dont know about this right here mind explaining yourself this might be the most arrogant thing i say all night but i actually resent the fact that im gonna get judged someday like if thats true that somebodys gonna judge me that doesnt even make any sense its like dude you made me so this is your fuckup all right lets not try to turn this around on me you know jesus christ you give me freedom of choice you make whores you have me suck at math and you dont think this things gonna go off the rails like you set me up to fail and now you got the balls to now question your own goddamn work dude if i made a car if i built a car and it didnt run i wouldnt burn it forever you evil piece of shit just light it on fire i wouldnt i would troubleshoot is there gas in the engine is the battery charged anything beyond this i got to get a real man to look at it but i believe in you im gonna try and help you out yes my religion its nuts its fucking nuts like my religion like the way i was brought up is like you know you can make it to heaven but like some of your family members possibly couldnt or some of your friends doesnt even make sense like how am i supposed to enjoy heaven if thats the deal right just sitting here waiting for my friends to show up jesus christ where the hell are they its been likeyears they must have ate a lot of brussels sprouts or some shit doing some yoga right and then one day it just settles in that they didnt make it and then what im still gonna enjoy heaven right jesus coming walking over hey how is it going everybody isnt this great isnt this great yeah dude itd be even better if all my family members and friends werent burning for fucking ever kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there jstar what do you think hey dude i didnt ask you to come over you came walking over with your big dumb sandals hey hey how is it going over here why did you come over here i dont give a damn dude tell your dad i dont give a fuck im already in here im already in here what are you gonna kick me out afterwards go fuck yourself i knew he was gonna be like that i knew it the bosss son is the worst fucking sense of entitlement so yeah so they believe when you die youre dead and i was like so youre just dead like how do you wrap your head around not existing i couldnt get my head around it he goes well like before when you were born do you remember that and i was like no and the guys like yeah its just like that im like not only does that make sense that is absolutely terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared im getting as i get older im developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it its not straightacrosstheboard flying i dont like small planes all of a sudden i just dont like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just dont believe in the pilots cause you know what i dont think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like all right well give you likepeople see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring anotherback well let you do this for a while you do this for a while we dont get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit well move you up topeople and then one day youll be in a jet– whoo were going a little faster right big planes youre getting the fuckin pilot that knows what hes doing hes probably fought in a war hes used to getting shot at he cant bring this bus in its a joke right a bunch of people whining in the back my headphones dont work he doesnt give a fuck right hes up there sleeping hes trying to make something happen hes so goddamn bored thats a stud up there right so one time im flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so im on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulenceand it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously likeall of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the planes made of like all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises whoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa im not gonna lie i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life dude that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child but turn around and see a earold mustachioed male going whoo whaaa whoa dude the hair was standing up on my arms im praying to a higher power i dont even believe in the shit i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like dude would you shut the fuck up jesus christ be a man push it down push it down deny your feelings act like you have answers do some man shit right now do some man shit jesus christ you know you think im not up here thinking whaaa whoa i am but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house you know what kills me what absolutely kills me is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy marry him and make half whooo whaaaa fucking kids and you know what we become weaker as a species we dodo you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals now they build cars but it used to be about animals right now its all car stuff looking forward to getting that carburetor today the carburetor didnt fit what do you mean the carburetor doesnt fit dads gonna be madtheres never enough time to build the car its so fucking stupid we got to have this bus done by thursday or else what the guy doesnt want it anymore all right youll get the thing when we finish it okay this is a safety issue you want brakes on it then go get yourself some fucking lunch so beforebefore there used to just be animals and this is what i noticed everything from a lion all the way down to an insect okay if you had one drop of whoo whaaa bitchy blood in you none of the females would fuck you that was it your life was over your life was over no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eightday ant life cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew and the female ant saw it theyre like all right stay away from that one stay away from that one hes gonna jeopardize the whole hill and stacy listen to me human beings have empathy some woman will fall in love well hes nice he wears a sweater he likes to bake you know he lets me finish my stories which is all great qualities okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that youre rolling the dice youre rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house this is the dude who has your back whos gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door and youre gonna turn around all youre gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window i dont know man thats risky you know in reality im being too hard on that guy yeah i am i am cause i was just as scared as he was except i didnt scream out like he did and thats simple the simple reason was this dude he was hugged too much as a child having people going how was your day whats wrong and all of that shit you know thats why i came down here i came out here to tell you guys you got to stop hugging your children you are ruining this country now you can hug your daughters you got to do that you got to do that hug those hooker shoes right out of them let them know that youre a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug them a little bit but every three four you got to fucking knock em down right come on it didnt hurt get up i didnt come from a family i dont know about you guys i didnt come from a touchyfeely call me when you get there mwah mwah none of that shit first time my mom hugged me i think was like once when i was little and when i moved out that was it and we only hugged cause we knew we were supposed to so we just tried to like it was like two parking meters came to life like we almost bumped heads it was horrific fucking horrific to this day sometimes i drive down the street and i think about that hug and its just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head ill just be driving down the street just be like aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head theres something about me like all my regret comes up when im in the shower i dont know what it is i think cause im in the shower and i have time to think and ill just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and ill just be in the shower just being likeand my wifes always just like is everything okay in there ill just be like yeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much every day so yeah i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her how come we never did the hugging thing how come we didnt do that stuff she was like i wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay and i was like you were afraid and she goes well it was your father thats what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you dont know how to raise boys and if you hug them thats whats gonna happen so in a marriage theres compromises yeah so she basically never hugged us cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad did for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle– sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal im gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i dont have any kids as far as id think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didnt work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesnt talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like dont change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler so he took it from that and knocked it down to dont hug him its gonna make him gay right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid ill whittle it down to like hes not taking drama class all right hes not taking drama class cause i said so lady let me handle this i wont fix everything and thats not a homophobic thing either that i wouldnt send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isnt i would send id let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son cant fucking do any of that shit unless im sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybodys doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybodys likecottage cheese what is it made ofthen he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but theres no way im letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals hes gonna get the shit kicked out of him hes gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like theres some sort of tomfoolery going on around here i dont want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know hes down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific you ever do that again im gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog all rightover so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married thats the big thing yes i did very happy about that im very happy because it was starting to get weird its likeyears old my girlfriend yeah were gonna go out and get some pop going to parties it was just weird cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldnt contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis its just its an advanced learning program the deadline is may h we have to stop the bullying with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old id just be like did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cats food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didnt care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didnt know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands so now im married so the next move is youre supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but imyears old im just thinking its too fucking late ya know come on man im gonna have a kid im gonna die of natural causes when the kids in fifth grade throwing him a frisbee we used to use these on a saturday do a face plant my kids standing there mom dads sleeping again i feel hopelessly behind all my friends have kids most of my friends who have kids are cool but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid that i dont understand anything anymore you know those people the most basic shit hey man its kind of cold out today dude you dont understand you dont understand cold till you got a twoyearold with a mitten up his ass and youre trying to get chocolate off the other ones face all right all right i get it you have a more complex life but i still understand being cold teeth chattering kind of lets me know right mine just turned six mine just turned seven i just feel hopelessly behind so what im actually thinking of doing im thinking about adopting yeah absolutely recycle you know think globally act locally everything doesnt have to be brandnew you know its like when you redo your kitchen you got custom up top you got ikea down the bottom right id love to adopt its a great thing to do but if i do it im not telling any of my friends im just gonna show up with the kid one day just to piss em off mine just turned six mine just turned seven id love to just show up with an eightyearold like dominoes yeah now i get to tell you what you dont understand sevenyearold wait till they turn eight eight is such a funny age terrible twos try the instant eights bam theyre just there like with all their issues i should do it though i should adopt i think its a great thing to do and i already know what i want to get i do i want to get like an always garaged good dentition do you know what i would love to do id love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop wouldnt that be amazing like find the kid that made this shirt just show up at the factory like hey come on bring it in bring it in you little maniac how you doing youre going back to the states lshaped couch flat screen tv get in the car the rest of you keep sewing but you youre coming home with me yeah dude how easy how easy would that kid be to raise after the hell hes been through all i gotta do is let him sit down i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met just bring him home have a seat hell be like i get to sit down yeah lay down on the couch hell be like its like a cloud its like a cloud ill get him a bowl of fritos put on cricket or soccer one of those sweatshop sports i dont know the kid would love me so thats my first draft pick all right coming out of the gate with that in the second round id probably get like anboy soldier ya know yeah shore up the offensive line you gotta protect the blindside thats how fucked up the world is theres little boys out there fighting in wars so thats a twofer i can drag him out of that hell give him something of whats left of his childhood and god forbid if the dollar ever collapses right shit goes south zombies take over i got backup everybody thinks im gonna be the problem meanwhile i got this sawedoff chuck norris standing next to mekills confirmed fucking kills theyre not stories can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster you cant coach that right i got to be honest with you i feel like id have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider i might be nuts but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid right i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room im getting sick of this shit goes for you too if you want but you youve been out of line all day mister dont even start that shit dont even start that shit you say that every time yes you do every fucking time you say that you know the answer you want me to say it again ill break it down to you you know why it is you want to know why cause you sew all right yeah you sew dude hes fucking killed people do you understand that no he doesnt he doesnt have to make his bed too no he doesnt because he doesnt sleep in the bed hes out in the bushes all night talking to himself freaking me the fuck out all right oh fuck you fuck you he scares me too he scares me too dont even start that shit you wanted a big brother and i got you one dont even start that shit all right all right youre right stop crying stop crying shouldnt have yelled at you i just thought i could fucking bring him in give him a couple of pop tarts i figured hed chill out fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows doing that full metal jacket shit no you cant give him back it doesnt work that way there he is there he is whats up buddy whats going on we were just talking about you just doing like a little surprise thing you feeling all right you feeling all right youre not looking through those eyebrows huh everything okay so i figure uh i dont know if ill do it maybe im too selfish i have no idea im all over the fuckin map do you know what i want to do right now i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter man i do thats my latest thing you know why it is its cause i live in los angeles yeah and its an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning theres not even zoning laws theyll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then theres like a fucking daycare center right the city doesnt even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta youre all right i dont know maybe in atlanta might be crazy youre on the outskirts youre fine youre fine you dont live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath youre cool drink that water for a gooddays la theres nowhere to go thats why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate fuck this im out vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street fuck this this looks safe you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter shes just like yeah no which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like oh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so there goes that hey what other dreams arent i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask yeah im still gonna do it im just not gonna tell her im just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license im not going to tell her im just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room shes just gonna be like what is that what is that for what does that mean yeah someday youll see someday youll see when the shit hits the fan and youre freaking the fuck out and im taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter what is that shut the fuck up and get in now you guys think im bullshitting im not im serious imin on this and ever since i got into it im seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them doing key bumps and shit theyre after me swear to god im seeing stories about them its just like that old advertising anecdote i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden theyre all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away its the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours foryears–years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream i built it up foryears here you go son make the family and the family name proud all right dad i love you all right this poor kid five days in hes supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but hes like i need the money i gotta give him a tour right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped out yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake we love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft thats orange county theres overmiles of beaches there put your seatbelt back onmiles of beaches was established as a county insir please dont open the door sir what are you doing sir no no dont dont stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck air traffic control i dont know whos on this frequency but you really need– somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he wasyears old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldnt figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didnt go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man take me up in a chopper im looking at the land i love and then im jumping out like a superhero i loved it yeahthis guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i cant imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like fuck you disease i decide ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer take me up in the chopper he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard hes not even listening to this guy giving the tour right overmiles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county insir please dont try to open the door no no dont dont dont incredible but heres the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the oceanfeet up youd think that would be enough so im thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic oot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didnt change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for

just like whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter boy you hear something whats the matter what are you barking for youre shaking whats the matter huh you hear something whats– come on man quit fucking around i got to go to work tomorrowall of a sudden boom that door flies open you just see this shadowy figure you pick up that gun blamand you fucking miss you miss you

coming around the fucking bed takes off your head if you had theyou could still hear your ears would be ringing but you could hear that fucker coming across and you could shoot at him and he would leave he would leave you guys just wont get off the fact that its a fuckinyoure like psychotic with this shit all right no no no no no no no let me– i will extend an olive branch to you people okay i get it i get it that ais basically a roidedup bb gun i got it okay i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody you have to basically have the gun up to somebodys head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger i understand that okay but i maintain i dont care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house i could defend my house with a bb gun i dont give a fuck how tough you are i dont care if i started shooting at you with a bb gun at the very least you have to go back outside and regroup thats a fact that is a fact if i caught you in your elbow that might be the end of your night look im coming back im coming back ive been trying to get along with my wife better im trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship im not turning out the pilot light though all right im keeping some fight in me im not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like i guess were making holiday cookies that dude with the bowed shoulders she makes them and then im supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them i dont even think they taste that good but just– no i stand my ground sometimes sometimes i let it go you just got to figure it out we had a fight the other night she got so mad at me she was like you can just sleep downstairs you can just sleep downstairs i couldnt believe it its one of the most arrogant things ive ever heard in my life one adult telling another adult where they can sleep you can just sleep downstairs like i was just gonna sit up in bed grab a blanket like linus all right hey where downstairs by the way like over here downstairs or like more over here where should i sleep its like are you out of your mind i go im not sleeping downstairs shes like where you gonna sleep then im like where i always sleep i will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if i want to what are you gonna do im bigger than you ill hang onto the covers try to get me out no tickling go ahead yeah i was like you dont tell me where to sleep i sleep where i want to sleep shes like well you dont tell me where to sleep im like im not the one telling people where to sleep it was one of those classic relationship fights its likein the morning youre both half naked shes not wearing a bra you got half a ball hanging out and another thing no no i need to say this the other day i felt slighted its fuckin unreal but what kills me is that theres actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit yeah you talk to them theyll be hey hows it been going its been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch you know how that is right no i dont i dont understand how did you get yourself into that situation like what are you afraid of what is she gonna do if you say no what is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table i understand if youre dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit then you got to sleep where she says to sleep you got to shes gonna come at you well lets get you in an arm bar all right all right all right tapping out or even worse she chokes you out you wake up on the couch likeminutes later just grab your jacket off the back of the couch i fucking hate when she does this its like its not even fair have a debate like a normal person all right im gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here someone whos actually been sleeping on the couch okay so theres the first fear out the window okay she cant physically dominate you so thats gone whats the next fear shes gonna cut off the sex yeah rub one out neutralized its the most empty threat there is do it right in front of her join me yeah ive never understood that threat thats like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator but you got a sandwich in your pocket a neverending sandwich like some biblical shit like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever so now whats the last thing she can do what can she do now be moody you cant handle that walk by your tv without looking at you only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen who gives a fuck my wife does that i just sit there i just start commentating here she comes again walking by the tv she really must be mad shes never bodyslammed me once ever im not saying to be a dick all right im just saying you got to keep them honest every once in a while you got to have a little pushback hey hey hey hey hey rest of the shit– im learning that about women you just want to keep them calm just keep them calm like a rescue dog right just everythings cool everythings cool just yeah yeah yeah this is great this is great im having a great time no your friends are awesome your friends are awesome very interesting party i am talking to people im talking to people i am having a good time here thats what you do you just do that enough then when you bark back you got a little something heres an olive branch ive extended to her its basically we fight a lot over television ive kind of come her way shes come my way she watches a little bit of sports i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which i dont care the nerds gonna fuck the cheerleader ill watch it right i dont mind them its an uplifting story i just dont like the love scenes in romantic comedies they creep me out theyre just so fucking nice its like missionarystyle theres candles that stupid saxophone musicit always goes down like the saxophone implies the penetration right cause they cant show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the otherof her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a womans sexuality thats never brought up that whole hold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i dont even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didnt even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didnt know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like what are you doing she says like i dont know i just kinda like ya know its like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why dont you want to do it itll be fun why dont i want to do it i dont think i want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck having the cops show up yeah shes in here officer damndest thing it was her idea i swear to god it was her idea yeah they always make it nice in those movies the raciest thing theyll do is every once in a while theyll kiss up against a wall i guess women like walls i didnt know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing oh my god its the wall oh my god its supporting me maybe hell support me its a metaphor i love it yeah i saw one the other night they were doing that and then out of nowhere they started having sex up against the wall im like finally something a little bit more interesting right but they were doing it standing up facing each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult positions there is and they were doing it with little to no difficulty all she did was lift her leg up like that and that was it he was off to the races i ruined the movie for my wife im like that is fucking bullshit bullshit what does the guy have like a ushaped dick how is he doing anything is he sticking it in her navel did he grease up her thighs to hell with her needs like if all shes gonna do is this shes got to bring it up like an offsides call if thats what shes doing all right if not you got to make some adjustments you just got to grab the other leg you got to try to pick her up there use these musclesmaybe you could grab a doorjamb drop down try to come in try to do that dude nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer thanseconds before theyre like all right this is ridiculous okay my calves are burning i cant get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage i can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world these guys in the movie they have no problem banging away then they pick them up like theyre not heavy they start walking down they see the bed they just lay her down on the bed dude im not trying to be a dick but every woman in here is heavy yeah youre heavy youre an adult female jesus christ when do you stop picking up your kids when theyre like five or six get off of me jesus christ youre gonna throw out my back go jump on your brother an adult woman weighspoundsall the way up to god knows what and its not balanced weight most of its in your thighs and in your ass your heads hanging off trying to counterbalance dude when guys go to the gym we dont putpounds on one side and aover here fuckin yeah yeah its ridiculous trying to carry a naked woman its like trying to carry a halffilled waterbed mattress youre like bumping into shit when you see the bed you dont walk to it you slowly start picking up momentum then she bounces off this mattress hits the wall slides down the whole sex vibes ruined and youre back to your sandwich in your pocket all right im out of time you guys were awesome thank
